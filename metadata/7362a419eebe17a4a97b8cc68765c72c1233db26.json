Through succinct tutorials, illustrations, and clear step-by-step instructions, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to create gadgets for examining the quality of our atmosphere, using Arduino and several inexpensive sensors.\n\nDetect harmful gases, dust particles such as smoke and smog, and upper atmospheric hazeÃ¢â‚¬â€substances and conditions that are often invisible to your senses. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also discover how to use the scientific method to help you learn even more from your atmospheric tests.\n\n- Get up to speed on Arduino with a quick electronics primer\n- Build a tropospheric gas sensor to detect carbon monoxide, LPG, butane, methane, benzene, and many other gases\n- Create an LED Photometer to measure how much of the sunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blue, green, and red light waves are penetrating the atmosphere\n- Build an LED sensitivity detectorÃ¢â‚¬â€and discover which light wavelengths each LED in your Photometer is receptive to\n- Learn how measuring light wavelengths lets you determine the amount of water vapor, ozone, and other substances in the atmosphere\n- Upload your data to Cosm and share it with others via the Internet\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The future will rely on citizen scientists collecting and analyzing their own data. The easy and fun gadgets in this book show everyone from Arduino beginners to experienced Makers how best to do that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œChris Anderson, Editor in Chief of Wired magazine, author of Makers: The New Industrial Revolution (Crown Business)\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
