They were part of the German metal scene to emerge in the early to mid-1980s. Over the course of their career, they have released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, and six singles/EPs. Although their earlier releases contained Satanic themes and imagery, Gerald &quot;Preacher&quot; Warnecke, the guitar player of the band, was studying theology at the time and is now a vicar in Cologne.\r\n    In 1987, the band released the album Under Jolly Roger, which was a switch to pirate-based and historical themes. While the historical lyrics were very superficial at first, the lyrics for later albums were intensively researched\r\n\r\nHeavy\r\nSubgenre: Speed / Power Metal\r\nBitrate:\t320 k\r\nSize:\t357.22 MB\r\nShow/Hide Files: \t\r\n34 files\r\n\r\nTrack list:\r\n\r\nDISC 1\r\n\r\n1.
