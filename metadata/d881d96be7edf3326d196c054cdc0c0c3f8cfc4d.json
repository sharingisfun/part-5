Combining a familiar track-based timeline with hundreds of thoughtful workflow innovations, Vegas Pro 13 is a refreshing, modern approach to post-production. Supporting more formats, more workflows, and more creative control than ever before, Vegas Pro 13 makes it easy to deliver your message and express your artistic vision.\n\nInnovative editing tools\n\n Edit SD, HD, 2K and 4K material in 2D or stereoscopic 3D, with drag-and-drop functionality or traditional 3-point and 4-point editing modes. The Vegas Pro 12 interface provides an impressive array innovative tools and thoughtful touches, with a fully customizable workspace for accomplishing a wide range of production tasks. Nest Vegas Pro projects within the timeline, customize and save keyboard commands, and use application scripting to automate repetitive tasks. The new Expanded Edit Mode temporarily splits the track at the edit point and enables you to dynamically add or remove frames from either side of the edit point while the media is playing, creating a highly precise, interactive editing experience\n\nPowerful effect and compositing engine\n\n Combine up to 32 high-quality, keyframeable effects per Effects Chain and apply them at the Event, Track, Media, or Project level. Vegas Pro 12 uses an advanced plug-in architecture based on the OpenFX standard, for hundreds of optional effects from leading visual effects plug-in VFX developers. Parent-Child tracks and sophisticated 2D and 3D compositing modes provide a powerful, flexible effects environment. Shape Masking tools and FX Masking capabilities are new for Vegas Pro 12, along with the Color Match plug-in,\n to quickly match the color characteristics from one clip to another.\n\nNew! Expanded edit mode\n\n Double click at the edit point to see the timeline in a detailed &quot;A-B Roll&quot; view. The adjacent frames of the events at the edit point can be clearly viewed above the tracks for reference, and unused media in the events can be seen in the track area. The edit point/event edge is highlighted in red, and can be trimmed with the mouse or numeric keypad. Setting a Loop Region around the edit point enables you to dynamically add or remove frames from either side of the edit point while the media is playing, creating a highly precise, interactive editing experience.\n\nNew! Project interchange\n\n Import and export a wide range of project files to and from Vegas Pro 12. The built-in software can convert between the native .veg file and AAF for AvidÃ‚Â® ProToolsÃ‚Â® 10, XML for AppleÃ‚Â® Final Cut ProÃ‚Â® 7, Final Cut Pro X (export only), DaVinci Resolve 8, and .prproj for AdobeÃ‚Â® PremiereÃ‚Â® Pro CS6 and After EffectsÃ‚Â® CS6.\n\nNew! User interface enhancements\n\n Multiple UI updates will help new users become familiar with Vegas Pro 12, as well as improving the editing experience for current Vegas Pro users. Included in the Enhancements: (1) A new Toolbar Icon for Splitting, (2) A yellow border outlines the most recently added clip on the timeline, (3) Large blue handles on timeline events make it easier to grab the various interactive event modifiers, and (4) more comprehensive tool tips, describing not just the name of the tool but also what the tool does.\n\nNew! Timeline editing and trimming updates\n\n New keyboard shortcuts enable video-only or audio-only trimming, for quick &quot;L Ã¢â‚¬â€œcuts&quot; and &quot;J-cuts.&quot; Simultaneous fade of audio and video in grouped events is now available. The Event FX, Generated Media, and Pan-Crop icons on timeline events have been relocated to the bottom edge, to avoid accidentally clicking on them while edge-trimming the event. A Trim Start-End mode quickly trims the beginning or end of an event based on the cursor position. Making a timeline selection and choosing &quot;Trim&quot; from the pulldown menus (CTRL+T) removes the media around the selection. Edge handles now use contrasting colors to make selection more noticeable, and improved outlining is used to make Event Selection, Grouping, and Sync Link groups more apparent.\n\nMulti-format native editing\n\n Vegas Pro 12 improves on its ground-breaking &quot;no transcode, no re-wrap&quot; heritage by adding native format support for Panasonic P2 AVC-Intra and DVCPRO source material. By eliminating the transcode and re-wrap process required by some competitors, Vegas Pro 12 users can save valuable production time, minimize storage requirements, and preserve the pristine quality of the original source material. Other natively-supported codecs and formats include XDCAMÃ¢â€žÂ¢, XDCAM EX, NXCAM, HDCAM-SRÃ¢â€žÂ¢, AVCCAM, REDÃ‚Â® R3D, AVCHD, and AVC-based MOV files from popular DSLR cameras. For 3D content creation, stereoscopic 3D MVC and MPO files from Sony camcorders are also supported.\n\nInnovative tools, thoughtful features\n\n Hundreds of thoughtful, innovative features make Vegas Pro12 one of the most fluid and intuitive editing platforms on the market. Visual confirmation of event alignment when moving clips on the timeline work hand in hand with the user-definable &quot;snapping&quot; tools, ensuring that your media is placed exactly where you need it, with sub-frame accuracy. Out of sync clips will re-sync at the push of a button by moving or slipping the audio or video. Insert Audio or Video envelopes on your timeline events to interactively control stereo or surround sound panning, volume, and event velocity. Plus much, much more.\n\n4K support\n\n Vegas Pro 12 software natively supports frame sizes up to 4096x4096. The 4K image standard for digital cinema projection is 4096 x 2160 pixels. This level of resolution provides more detail and flexibility to pan and crop. It is ideal for compositing and video effects work, as it provides a high-quality final output. Vegas Pro 12 software also natively supports RED ONEÃ‚Â® and RED EPICÃ‚Â® files. Open and edit .r3d files directly on the timeline.\n\nSync Link\n\n Establish a hierarchal relationship between timeline events during editing. &quot;Child&quot; clips associated with a &quot;Parent&quot; clip can be moved independently on the timeline, while moving the Parent clip also moves the child clips in perfect sync.\n\nMulticam editing\n\n Edit multi-camera productions intuitively and efficiently by specifying shots as you play back your project. Switch between as many as 32 video sources with a keyboard command or a click of your mouse. Vegas Pro 12 software keeps all unused shots so you can easily expand a multi-camera track into component events, making it easier to see which videos are in the Vegas project and refine the edits.\n\nGPU acceleration\n\n Better playback Ã¢â‚¬â€œ faster renders. Take advantage of the power of the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) found in many of today's most popular video display cards for smoother video playback and faster rendering. Vegas Pro 12 leverages the GPU for video effects, transitions, compositing, pan/crop, track motion, and encoding. With an optimized hardware configuration using an appropriate GPU device, timeline performance is dramatically improved. Higher resolution previews with multiple effects are now possible in Vegas Pro 12, and encoding to popular formats like AVC are as much as six times faster than previous versions. Vegas Pro 12 uses OpenCLÃ¢â€žÂ¢-supported devices from AMD, NVIDIA and Intel to unleash your creative vision.
