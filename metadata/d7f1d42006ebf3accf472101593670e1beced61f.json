Author and chef Yzabetta Sativah specializes in producing healthy baked goods for medical marijuana users, including those with special dietary requirements. \n\nThis book includes such gourmet delights as Marshmallow Meltdown, Dreamy Raspberry Bars, Lavender Love Bites, Aloha Hawaiian Bread, Baked Fudge, and Coco Nutty Lime Cookies, all certified classics at medical marijuana dispensaries across the country.
