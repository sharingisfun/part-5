But all she has to show for her efforts so far is a part in an ad for ugly Christmas sweaters, and a gig waiting tables at a comedy club. Her roommatesÃ¢â‚¬â€¢her best friend Jane, and Dan, an aspiring sci-fi writerÃ¢â‚¬â€¢are supportive, yet Franny knows a two-person fan club doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly count as success. Everyone tells her she needs a backup plan, and though she can almost picture moving back home and settling down with her perfectly nice ex-boyfriend, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not ready to give up on her goal of having a career like her idols Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. Not just yet. But while she dreams of filling their shoes, in the meantime, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d happily settle for a speaking part in almost anythingÃ¢â‚¬â€and finding a hair product combination that works.\n\nEverything is riding on the upcoming showcase for her acting class, where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll finally have a chance to perform for people who could actually hire her. And she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let herself be distracted by James Franklin, a notorious flirt and the most successful actor in her class, even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suddenly started paying attention. Meanwhile, her bank account is rapidly dwindling, her father wants her to come home, and her agent doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t return her calls. But for some reason, she keeps believing that she just might get what she came for.\n\nSomeday, Someday, Maybe is a story about hopes and dreams, being young in a city, and wanting something deeply, madly, desperately. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about finding love, finding yourself, and perhaps most difficult of all in New York City, finding an acting job","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5920774c13d67f841138fa17892e43f0498273b6","amp;dn":"Someday%2C+Someday%2C+Maybe+-+Lauren+Graham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5920774c13d67f841138fa17892e43f0498273b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,32,119,76,19,214,127,132,17,56,250,23,137,46,67,240,73,130,115,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
