The pieces in this collection were inspired by the gorgeous landscape of Boston, a true knitterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s town.\n\nA mix of five sweaters and five accessories, the Charles Collection includes patterns for every skill level and style. Sweaters are offered in 10 sizes ranging from 30 - 54Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the bust; all include flattering shaping and tailored details.\n\nYou will find garments ranging from small to large, from practical to luxurious, from soothing and simple to more rigorous and challenging. Knitted with yarns we love, and in colors that evoke the rich autumn of New England, these pieces are lovely to knit, give, keep, and wear. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1efd3726a1a26541e9e7f17e9bc7148c6114bd","amp;dn":"The+Charles+Collection+-+Knitting+Patterns+by+Amy+Herzog%2C+Kriste","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1efd3726a1a26541e9e7f17e9bc7148c6114bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,30,253,55,38,161,162,101,65,233,231,241,126,155,199,20,140,97,20,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
