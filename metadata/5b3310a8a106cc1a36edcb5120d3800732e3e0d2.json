The &quot;close&quot; worlds are almost identical to 'our' Earth (referred to as &quot;Datum Earth&quot;), others differ in greater and greater details, but all share one similarity: on none are there, or have there ever been, Homo sapiens - although the same cannot be said for earlier hominid species, especially Homo habilis. The books explore the theme of how humanity might develop when freed from resource constraints: one example Pratchett has cited is that wars result from lack of land Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what would happen if no shortage of land (or gold or oil or food) existed?\n\nThe books deal primarily with the journeys of Joshua ValientÃƒÂ© (a natural 'Stepper') and Lobsang, who claims to be a Tibetan motorcycle repairman reincarnated as an Artificial intelligence. The two chart a course to learn as much as possible about the parallel worlds, travelling millions of steps away from the original Earth. They encounter evidence of other humanoid species (referred to as trolls and elves); of human settlers who learned their gifts early, and of an extinct race of bipedal dinosaur descendants. They also encounter warning signs of a great danger, millions of worlds away from 'our' Earth, causing catastrophe as it moves. The books also deal with the effects of the explosion of available space on the people of Datum Earth and the new colonies and political movements that are spreading in the wake of Step Day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b3310a8a106cc1a36edcb5120d3800732e3e0d2","amp;dn":"Terry+Pratchett+%26amp%3B+Stephen+Baxter+-The+Long+Earth+series-+3+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b3310a8a106cc1a36edcb5120d3800732e3e0d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,51,16,168,161,6,204,26,54,237,203,81,32,211,128,7,50,227,224,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
