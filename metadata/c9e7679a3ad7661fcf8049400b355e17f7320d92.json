Please! Please! donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t leave me Meg! Please donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\nleave me! (I was putting myself into the picture in GarciaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s role - although IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m \nreal Irish and he has all the makings to be rightly initiated over time too!!) - \nalthough in real life IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve only ever had that sort of mindset once myself- when\nI was married into a wealthy family from Australia - with aprincess\n(in what was her spirit and manner) as my wife (Elizabeth).\n\nMeg Ryan has a problem - the pickings are slim, folks always trying to talk her \nout of taking real and genuine care where its available (And Andy Garcia has it\nto spare if you really get to know the true greatness in him) and she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t \nthink he cues quite as much on the quick uptake and so she feels left out when\naround her own crowd.\n\nYet what is being on the &quot;in&quot; of pop culture in America preaching to Meg other\nthan &quot;affirmative action&quot; of the worst kind exclusively?\n\nOn the other hand, Garcia is too intense in his approach at times, sometimes\nseeming blind to what is good and the right thing to do. he is smothering towards \na child wanting to seek out her real father - as he uses the wrong instincts to \nwin - thinking all can be brought to their knees in some respect if he just \ninsists &quot;itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll pass&quot; as the right solution to what the problems are, as he sees \nthem instead.\n\nYou have to know when to give a person space, and realize what is even assaultive\nin some respect, on fragile sensibilities. Yet Garcia wants to be good - and he \nhas it within him to learn a better way. We arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t shown much in the movies of\nwhat Meg Ryan often has to endure from types sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s normally around - you might\njust consider Garcia an actual saint in the making after all.\n\n\nMeg Ryan often plays too hard to get (in life through such situations) in a way\nthat cannot be overcome, other than she feels you have had to endure so as to \naffirm her sense of worth. What is that worth? Fact is that if she chose to\npresses the bargain - there's no price too high that she wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t deserve\nhypothetically. the Irish gals are as God on earth in their capacity for\nChristianly beauty that is not seconded anywhere on gods green earth - \nI speak of course broadly to include all the Irish spirited gals of \nthe most dear in Ireland, Australia Germany France Sweden and elsewhere - even \nRussia certainly too. Yet the American model is supremely a great Christian in \ntheir capacity for goodness so as to be a beacon to the planet at some point.\nThey'd have to remember the accent they once spoke with back in Germany or\nIreland - and lo and behold - true brilliance would overcome them. \nOf this IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m altogether certain. Truly great folks there\n\n\nBut whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the point  of breaking something just to hand it to someone back and\nthen say &quot;now you can keep it cause if it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t broke - it would be more than you\ndeserve. (Speaking of Garcia's heart here in a manner of speaking that is).\n\nNo man can truly and adequately deserve meg Ryan. she is just too beautiful for\nhuman comprehension. She has to be cared for and nurtured and love without\nreservation. But if she is to remain sane and in her human beauty she must be\nfair as well, to those who are deserving it. They only must be willing to try and \nbe ably willing to do better - and demonstrably so - they might just turn out to\nbe the best when theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been shown the ropes. Only theyd have to come with some\nwisdom too and the stuff of Garcia has endured much and remained greatly virile\nand committed to the care of family and with true genuine emotions of\nconscientious care and love second to none, I submit, when it is in fact secure.\n\nMeg Ryan deserves an Irish spirited man who has real love to give and will\ntreasure and comfort her and bring her joy. Andy Garcia should be allowed to\naudition in full fairness. He could just be the best sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got with what the\nworld has come to in some respects now. I can tell you his sort doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tolerate\nOJ getting away with what he did - and he would stake his life if he were\nprotecting his own in a situation of life and death in the legitimate defence\nof the community. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scary for some - on the other hand - whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not scary\nabout those that ask OJ for autographs instead? IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m just saying Meg doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have\nmany vocal friends left - as they're all preachin equality down there just now.\nso whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lovely gal to do? \n\n\nBy the way, its not quite fair that she asks Garcia not to act as though he can \ncure all with just his strength. Strength with Christianly wisdom is what a man\nmust give or no woman will remain healthy mentally speaking. Her spirit will\nwither and she will not remain with him given the chance. She needs strength.\nBut physically engaged strength alone cannot save the day in America. You have\nto be on the &quot;team&quot;  as it were or no one pulls the strings for you. as such he\nfaces unfair competition and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really know the system he is into well\nenough to play as a winner should. He might just be shocked to learn \nhow to cue well enough to say yeah' I guess I could sell my soul too.\n\nI never had any tolerance for seeing someone raise their voice to a Meg Ryan\nhowever I now only insist it be in competent true christinly spirit (god-\nlike in fact), based on merited genuine care and true love and in fully deserving\nfashion - or else IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not going to stand idly by myself! I love this gal dearly\nand it is to her happiness that I stake my life. At the expense of all - none\nexcepted! be nice to this gal, huh! \n\n\nI love you Meg Ryan! Please don ever leave a nice guy again! They be hard\nto find as it is dear! ever seen a grown man cry? thats what Andy Garcia and\nme are made to do with genuine care!\n\nSo there!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9e7679a3ad7661fcf8049400b355e17f7320d92","amp;dn":"When+a+man+loves+a+woman+%28695MB+DivX%29+moviesbyrizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9e7679a3ad7661fcf8049400b355e17f7320d92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,231,103,154,58,215,102,31,207,128,73,64,11,53,94,23,247,50,13,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
