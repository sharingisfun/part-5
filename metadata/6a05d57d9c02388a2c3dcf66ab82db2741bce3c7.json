Such was the case for Ian Tattersall and Rob DeSalle, scientists who frequently collaborate on book and museum exhibition projects. When the conversation turned to wine one evening, it almost inevitably led the twoâ€”one a palaeoanthropologist, the other a molecular biologistâ€”to begin exploring the many intersections between science and wine. This book presents their fascinating, freewheeling answers to the question â€œWhat can science tell us about wine?â€ And vice versa.\r\n \r\nConversational and accessible to everyone, this colorfully illustrated book embraces almost every imaginable area of the sciences, from microbiology and ecology (for an understanding of what creates this complex beverage) to physiology and neurobiology (for insight into the effects of wine on the mind and body). The authors draw on physics, chemistry, biochemistry, evolution, and climatology, and they expand the discussion to include insights from anthropology, primatology, entomology, Neolithic archaeology, and even classical history. The resulting volume is indispensible for anyone who wishes to appreciate wine to its fullest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a05d57d9c02388a2c3dcf66ab82db2741bce3c7","amp;dn":"A+Natural+History+of+Wine+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a05d57d9c02388a2c3dcf66ab82db2741bce3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,5,213,125,156,2,56,138,44,61,207,102,171,130,219,39,65,188,227,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
