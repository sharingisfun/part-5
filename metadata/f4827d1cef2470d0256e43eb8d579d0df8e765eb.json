Professional shooter Derrick Story shows how to capture beautiful, illuminated portraits with natural daylight, and shares tricks for how to get fantastic shots even when the light is not so great. Derrick teaches how to work with photo disc light modifiers to bounce in light to areas that need it. He also explains how to use shade, when it's available, for a completely different look. At the end of the course, Derrick describes how to upload photos to Flickr for review and comment.\n\nNatural Light Portrait Photo Assignment Flickr Discussion Group","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4827d1cef2470d0256e43eb8d579d0df8e765eb","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Photo+Assignment%3A+Natural+Light+Portraits+with+Derrick+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4827d1cef2470d0256e43eb8d579d0df8e765eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,130,125,28,239,36,112,208,37,110,67,235,141,87,157,13,248,231,101,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
