As a result, our country has generally worked to keep the military out of law enforcement. But according to investigative reporter Radley Balko, over the last several decades, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cops have increasingly come to resemble ground troops. The consequences have been dire: the home is no longer a place of sanctuary, the Fourth Amendment has been gutted, and police today have been conditioned to see the citizens they serve as an otherÃ¢â‚¬â€an enemy.\nTodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armored-up policemen are a far cry from the constables of early America. The unrest of the 1960s brought about the invention of the SWAT unitÃ¢â‚¬â€which in turn led to the debut of military tactics in the ranks of police officers. NixonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War on Drugs, ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War on Poverty, ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s COPS program, the postÃ¢â‚¬â€œ9/11 security state under Bush and Obama: by degrees, each of these innovations expanded and empowered police forces, always at the expense of civil liberties. And these are just four among a slew of reckless programs.\nIn Rise of the Warrior Cop, Balko shows how politiciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ill-considered policies and relentless declarations of war against vague enemies like crime, drugs, and terror have blurred the distinction between cop and soldier. His fascinating, frightening narrative shows how over a generation, a creeping battlefield mentality has isolated and alienated American police officers and put them on a collision course with the values of a free society.\nGenre: Non Fiction, Social Science / Criminology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ca159f2f50c31ab8da91aa6d595e89c4044716","amp;dn":"Rise+of+the+Warrior+Cop_+The+Mi+-+Radley+Balko.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ca159f2f50c31ab8da91aa6d595e89c4044716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,202,21,159,47,80,195,26,184,218,145,170,109,89,94,137,196,4,71,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
