White, &quot;Here is New York&quot; \nEnglish | ISBN: 1892145022 | 2005 | 56 pages | EPUB | 3 MB\n\nIn the summer of 1948, E.B. White sat in a New York City hotel room and, sweltering in the heat, wrote a remarkable pristine essay, Here is New York. Perceptive, funny, and nostalgic, the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stroll around ManhattanÃ¢â‚¬â€with the reader arm-in-armÃ¢â‚¬â€remains the quintessential love letter to the city, written by one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost literary figures. Here is New York has been chosen by The New York Times as one of the ten best books ever written about the city. The New Yorker calls it Ã¢â‚¬Å“the wittiest essay, and one of the most perceptive, ever done on the city.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea088414c6dde9ed93ad7fe3fc2c2d1984934b8f","amp;dn":"Here+is+New+York+by+E.B.+White+%28Essay+Ebook%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea088414c6dde9ed93ad7fe3fc2c2d1984934b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,8,132,20,198,221,233,237,147,173,127,227,252,44,45,25,132,147,75,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
