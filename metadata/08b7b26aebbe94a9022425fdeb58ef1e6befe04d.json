Young Zahariel and Nemiel aspire to join the greatest of the orders, led by the example of mighty Lion ElÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Jonson and his vision of a peaceful and unified world. But the coming of the Imperium brings new concerns and a new destiny for the Lion as part of the Great Crusade, and the sons of Caliban must decide if they will follow him to glory among the stars.\nABOUT THE AUDIO\n\nProduced by Black Library and Heavy Entertainment.
