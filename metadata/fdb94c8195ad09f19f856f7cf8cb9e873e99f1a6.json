After releasing her fourth studio album Red (2012) and embarking on The Red Tour (2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14), her personal life generated significant media attention. Swift began planning her follow-up project in 2013 and continued work into 2014, during which she collaborated with producers including Max Martin and Shellback, while the former served as the album's executive producer along with Swift. The album's title was inspired by the pop music scene of her birth year.\n\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nFile size : 47.3 MiB\nDuration : 3mn 39s\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 1 811 Kbps\nAlbum : 1989\nAlbum/Performer : Taylor Swift\nTrack name : Shake It Off\nTrack name/Position : 06\nTrack name/Total : 13\nPerformer : Taylor Swift\nComposer : Taylor Swift, Max Martin, Shellback\nGenre : Pop\nRecorded date : 2014\nCover : Yes\nCover type : Cover (front)\nCover MIME : image/jpeg\n\nAudio\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration : 3mn 39s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 1 801 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\nStream size : 47.1 MiB (99%)\nWriting library : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdb94c8195ad09f19f856f7cf8cb9e873e99f1a6","amp;dn":"1989.Taylor.Swift.FLAC.24-Bit.FIXED.iSAAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdb94c8195ad09f19f856f7cf8cb9e873e99f1a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,185,76,129,149,173,9,241,159,133,111,124,248,203,158,135,62,153,241,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
