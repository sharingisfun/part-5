Guided by the patient's chief complaint, this text presents a concise, methodical approach to patient evaluation, management and problem solving in the Emergency Department. Unlike other textbooks, which elaborate on known diagnoses, this extraordinary book approaches clinical problems as clinicians approach patients - without full knowledge of the final diagnosis. Fully revised and updated, the second edition includes new chapters on sepsis, bleeding, burns, neonatal, alcohol-related, and dental emergencies. Stunning full-color chapters include clinical images (photographs, ECGs and radiologic studies), detailed illustrations and practical tables. Written and edited by experienced educators, researchers, and practitioners in Emergency Medicine, this text is core reading for students and residents, and an important resource for practising emergency physicians, faculty, and other healthcare providers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6925171735cd7e83df3318256bba49b5c7b948ef","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Clinical+Emergency+Medicine%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6925171735cd7e83df3318256bba49b5c7b948ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,37,23,23,53,205,126,131,223,51,24,37,107,186,73,181,199,185,72,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
