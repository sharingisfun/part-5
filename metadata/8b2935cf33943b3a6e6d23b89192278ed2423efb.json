Pretty much the utmost qualities youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d want out of a human being, right? Those descriptors are certainly less trustworthy when applied to art, as theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re often considered the byproducts of complacency, or at least a warning sign. Whenever a band comes along that people tell you is Ã¢â‚¬Å“necessary,&quot; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re probably ripping shit up, telling you what to think, espousing conflict against music and listeners that got a little too comfy. Mutual Benefit isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t revolutionary and LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Crushing Diamond is not going to judge you. But in no way is Jordan Lee a complacent songwriter. In fact, throughout this collection of seven gorgeous, baroque-folk songs, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dealing in perhaps the most pervasive and difficult internal battle of all: how can you be a loving, patient, warmhearted and unfailingly hopeful person in an environment that makes it far easier to not give a shit?\nA good start is to surround yourself with fellow warriors of the meekÃ¢â‚¬â€Mutual Benefit brings to mind the Ã¢â‚¬Å“collectiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ format, Ã¢â‚¬Å“AnimalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or otherwise, that played a large role in defining the tone of indie rock during the early 2000s. Think of Microphones, Sparklehorse, Danielson Famile, Akron/Family, early Sufjan Stevens and Devendra Banhart, where an open-ended Ã¢â‚¬Å“bandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ surrounds a central voice seeking to explore the ideas of what Ã¢â‚¬Å“folkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or roots music really means. Mutual Benefit certainly qualifies, though not in the way that equates Ã¢â‚¬Å“folkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with rusticity, an acoustic guitar and rigid verse-chorus structure. Songs invariably rise out of twenty or so seconds of everyone getting situated, tapping out piano riffs, trying to get the percussion in rhythm and determining whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to sing. From there on out, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often contain one central melody and a clearly elucidated mood that spools throughout, while the arrangements are surprising and intuitive, like everyone involved might be swapping instruments as it goes along.\nThe sound here is proudly analog, though not lo-fi, and LeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs are thick, but not dense. Beginning with his lightly enunciated vocals, soft strands are collected and continuously bundled throughout and nuzzled by reverb without being smothered by it, a big ball of sonic yarn to fall into. Some curious threads peek through to add a shock of color: the banjo lacing LeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awestruck infatuation on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Advanced FalconryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, household percussion clacking throughout Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ËœLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PlayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Statue of a ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, gentle, female harmonies and a steady drum machine tick lending comfort to a wayward drug addict on Ã¢â‚¬Å“That Light That's BlindingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and an indeterminate synthesized instrument playing the glowing riff that explains the title of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Golden Wake.&quot;\nOn that particular song, a riverside meditation leads Lee to quitting his job and realizing Ã¢â‚¬Å“we werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t made to be afraid.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a major part of the plot engine in cubicle revenge fantasy Office Spaceand a motivating thread throughout the majority of chillwave, another genre thought to be a reaction to an increasingly hostile and hopeless time for socioeconomics. But LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Crushing Diamond is not folk in the escapist sense either, though it was recorded during a Ã¢â‚¬Å“year of notable absencesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in San Diego, Austin and Boston. Many of these songs take place in mundane, unglamorous localesÃ¢â‚¬â€city trains, mining towns, cornfields, motel rooms. And in Lee's point of view, you need to discover a little space within those places that you can call your own and then invite some people to share it with. Yeah, it does skew kinda hippie, as LeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics detail picking roses by the lake and how a river canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but keep on keepinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfectly fine within the scheme of LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Crushing Diamond, which always sounds populated in a way that stresses its central themes of getting your own shit together so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re better prepared to care for someone else.\nThis kind of perspective gives Mutual Benefit an unintended timeliness as well. As much as you want to consider music objectively, without some kind of sociological context, think of it this way: when Sufjan, Animal Collective and freak-folk came about, any afterglow of post-9/11 togetherness had given way to a terribly divisive and dirty presidential election, an escalating, vaguely defined war and a general sense that the country was being bullied into submission from the inside. This sort of music would inevitably be criticized for being apolitical and wimpy, but having seen where all this aggression got us, how could Sung Tongs or Cripple Crow not seem like the solution?\nLoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Crushing Diamond works in a similar way and opens itself up to some of the same criticisms, when being positive is the quickest way to have your sincerity questioned. Lee concedes these points without giving in, and makes the case that kindness is in no way a sign of weakness: DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seven-minute, closing reverie Ã¢â‚¬Å“Strong SwimmerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ acknowledges that it takes an Olympian level of strength to swim against the tide of negativity, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only choice. During Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ËœLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Play/Statue of a Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lee sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always love/when you think thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s none to giveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, true whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“tattered, strained or torn.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think of a statement that sounds more necessary.\nReview by Ian Cohen [8.4/10]\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n1.
