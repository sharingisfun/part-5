The songs are: &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;I Started a Joke&quot; , &quot;Words&quot;, &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, and &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;Night Fever&quot;, &quot;You Should be Dancing&quot;, &quot;Stayin' Alive&quot;, and &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;Alone&quot;, &quot;Still Waters&quot;, &quot;Closer than Close&quot;, &quot;I Gotta get a message to You&quot;, &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Lonely Days&quot;, &quot;Morning of My Life&quot;, &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941&quot;, Too Much Heaven&quot;, &quot;I can't see nobody&quot;, &quot;Run To Me&quot; &quot;And the Sun Will Shine&quot;, &quot;Nights On Broadway&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;tragedy&quot;, &quot;Jive Talking&quot;, and &quot;how deep is your Love&quot;. Included is a very moving tribute/duet to/with brother Andy done to the song &quot;Our Love&quot;, and other artists are recognized--Frankie Valli, Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta. Celine Dion is the special guest who does a duet on the song &quot;immortality&quot;.\n\n Their voices and harmonies are still exquisite; Robin, with that hauntingly beautiful sound, and Barry's voice, what can you say, is wonderful while Maurice seems to be the personality(good natured and funny) who deftly handles all the accompanying instruments. All three have given us FOUR decades of terrific music and have condensed it into ONE night's performance showcasing their unmistakable, and recognizable as ever Bee Gees' &quot;sound&quot;.\n\n DVD Track listing\n\n 1.&quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;\n 2.&quot;Alone&quot;\n 3.&quot;Massachusetts&quot;\n 4.&quot;To Love Somebody&quot;\n 5.&quot;I've Gotta Get a Message to You&quot;\n 6.&quot;Words&quot;\n 7.&quot;Closer Than Close&quot;\n 8.&quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;\n 9.&quot;One&quot;\n 10.&quot;Our Love (Don't Throw It All Away)&quot;\n 11.&quot;Night Fever&quot;\n 12.&quot;More Than a Woman&quot;\n 13.&quot;Still Waters (Run Deep)&quot;\n 14.&quot;Lonely Days&quot;\n 15.&quot;Morning of My Life (In the Morning)&quot;\n 16.&quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941&quot;\n 17.&quot;Too Much Heaven&quot;\n 18.&quot;I Can't See Nobody&quot;\n 19.&quot;Run to Me&quot;\n 20.&quot;And the Sun Will Shine&quot;\n 21.&quot;Nights on Broadway&quot;\n 22.&quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?&quot;\n 23.&quot;Heartbreaker&quot;\n 24.&quot;Guilty&quot;\n 25.&quot;Immortality&quot;\n 26.&quot;Tragedy&quot;\n 27.&quot;I Started a Joke&quot;\n 28.&quot;Grease&quot;\n 29.&quot;Jive Talkin'&quot;\n 30.&quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;\n 31.&quot;Stayin' Alive&quot;\n 32.&quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;\n\n Video Quality:\n\n image 720x540\n Audio 320 kbps\n\nPlease seed after download:-)\n\nMany thanks and enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07244a08dd165dfeb845749ef4aa6880168bbfe6","amp;dn":"Bee+Gees-+One+Night+Only+%281997%29-DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07244a08dd165dfeb845749ef4aa6880168bbfe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,36,74,8,221,22,93,254,184,69,116,158,244,170,104,128,22,139,191,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
