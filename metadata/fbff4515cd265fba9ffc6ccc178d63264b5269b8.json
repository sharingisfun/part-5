The book continues the idea of &quot;stickiness&quot; popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in The Tipping Point, seeking to explain what makes an idea or concept memorable or interesting. A similar style to Gladwell's is used, with a number of stories and case studies followed by principles. The stories range from urban legends, such as the &quot;Kidney Heist&quot; in the introduction; to business stories, as with the story of Southwest Airlines, &quot;the low price airline&quot;; to inspirational, personal stories such as that of Floyd Lee, a passionate mess hall manager. Each chapter includes a section entitled &quot;Clinic&quot;, in which the principles of the chapter are applied to a specific case study or idea to demonstrate the principle's application.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbff4515cd265fba9ffc6ccc178d63264b5269b8","amp;dn":"Made+To+Stick+-+Why+Some+Ideas+Survive+And+Others+Die.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbff4515cd265fba9ffc6ccc178d63264b5269b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,255,69,21,205,38,95,186,159,252,108,204,23,141,99,38,75,82,105,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
