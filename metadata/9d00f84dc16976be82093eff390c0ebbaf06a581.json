ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about how smart you are, but how open you are to learn new and effective powerful conversational rituals that prime the brain for trust, partnership, and mutual success. Conversational Intelligence translates the wealth of new insights coming out of neuroscience from across the globe, and brings the science down to earth so people can understand and apply it in their everyday lives. Author Judith Glaser presents a framework for knowing what kind of conversations trigger the lower, more primitive brain; and what activates higher-level intelligences such as trust, integrity, empathy, and good judgment. Conversational Intelligence makes complex scientific material simple to understand and apply through a wealth of easy to use tools, examples, conversational rituals, and practices for all levels of an organization. \n\nBasing her tips on recent neuroscience research, Benchmark Communications CEO and executive coach Glaser instructs readers on how to enhance conversations in a professional setting, and develop new conversational rituals. Case studies illustrate the essential transition up the levels: Level I, which is transactional (how to exchange data and information); Level II, which is positional (how to work with power and influence); and Level III, which is transformational (how to co-create the future for mutual success.) Following her advice, Glaser claims, will help readers adjust their neurochemistry, strengthen their relationships, and influence the way they interpret reality. The book is strongest when Glaser astutely describes issues such as becoming addicted to being right. Specifics for achieving the title&amp;'s promised conversational enhancement become lost, however, due to overwriting and overreliance on contrived acronyms and unnecessary trademarking: Conversational Intelligence ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¢, STAR Skills ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¢, Vital Instincts ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¢. While readers may glean encouragement from the ability to positively affect their interactions, the book&amp;'s tone will deter most readers.
