Applied Functional Analysis, the only textbook of its kind, is designed specifically for the graduate student in engineering and science who has little or no training in advanced mathematics. Comprehensive and easy-to-understand, this innovative textbook progresses from the essentials of preparatory mathematics to sophisticated functional analysis. This self-contained presentation requires few mathematical prerequisites and provides students with the fundamental concepts and theorems essential to mathematical analysis and modeling.\n \nApplied Functional Analysis combines various principles of mathematics, computer science, engineering, and science, laying the foundation for further specialty work in partial differential equations, approximation theory, numerical mathematics, control theory, mathematical physics, and related subjects. This new treatment of a classic subject outfits engineering and science majors with a graduate-level mathematics standing, otherwise accessible only through regular mathematics studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67ea93fe6a9068224e7140d4f4162453e3da6033","amp;dn":"Applied+Functional+Analysis+-+2nd+Edition+-+J.+Tinsley+Oden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67ea93fe6a9068224e7140d4f4162453e3da6033","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,234,147,254,106,144,104,34,78,113,64,212,244,22,36,83,227,218,96,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
