Use this book to discover even the most basic antenna designs-- wire and loop antennas, verticals, and Yagis--and for advanced antenna theory and applications. Many of the antennas in this edition benefit directly from advances in sophisticated computer modeling. \nThis 21st edition has been extensively revised to include information you can use to build highly optimized or specialized antennas. The book includes new content on Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) techniques, phased arrays, S-parameters as used in modern vector network analyzers (VNA), Beverage receiving antennas, mobile ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œscrewdriverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ antennas, ionospheric area-coverage maps, and muchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦much more. \nFully searchable CD-ROM included!\nBundled with this book is a CD-ROM containing The ARRL Antenna Book in its entirety, using the popular AdobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ReaderÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® software for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and MacintoshÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® systems.
