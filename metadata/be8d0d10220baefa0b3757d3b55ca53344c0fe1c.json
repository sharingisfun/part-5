Women were \n\ncalling us out left and right. They knew what we were trying to do. Hell, even Dr. Phil was tooling \n\nus on TV.\n\nA year ago you would have given anything to be a PUA. But today you cringe thinking about all the \n\ntimes you blew it by &quot;negging&quot; every cute girl that was into you.\n\nYou weren't having any fun. You were acting and dressing like a weirdo. Pickup was too much work.\n\nIt was too loud. Too in your face. Too obvious.\n\nJump Into 60's Hot Tub Time Machine\n\nNow just imagine for a second that I gave you a copy of &quot;The Game&quot; 5 years before anyone else had \n\nread it.\n\nPicture a world where you could go out to the bars and use all of the best openers and routines \n\nwithout worrying that every other guy was already doing the exact same thing.\n\nOr that women would know you were one of those lame &quot;pickup artists&quot; and laugh in your face.\n\nWith that advantage, you would probably be bringing home a new woman every night for years.\n\nAnd all your friends would be wondering ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ how the hell did you just do that?\n\nAh, the good old days.\n\n*\n\nWell That is EXACTLY What I Am Offering You Today\n\nMy new system of seduction is so under the radar that women can barely explain what's going on, let \n\nalone call you out for using it.\n\nAnd it's going to be a good 10 years before the Average Joe catches on to what we are doing. (If \n\never)\n\nRemember, we originally started this community for us. We don't need celebrity endorsements or \n\napproval from mainstream society.\n\nAnd that's why this time I'm keeping all of my best techniques strictly underground.\n\nRest assured, you won't be seeing my system featured on some stupid reality show anytime soon.\n\nAnd let's be honest.\n\nThe perception right now is that we are just a bunch of nerds. That our techniques don't work. That \n\nour time has passed.\n\nYou may have even noticed that it's become popular to &quot;hate on&quot; and make fun of the seduction \n\ncommunity.\n\nWell Who's Laughing Now B*tch?\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.60yearsofchallenge.com/revolution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.60yearsofchallenge.com/revolution/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be8d0d10220baefa0b3757d3b55ca53344c0fe1c","amp;dn":"Sixty+Years+of+Challenge+eBooks+-complete-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be8d0d10220baefa0b3757d3b55ca53344c0fe1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,141,13,16,34,11,174,250,11,55,87,211,181,92,165,51,68,192,254,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
