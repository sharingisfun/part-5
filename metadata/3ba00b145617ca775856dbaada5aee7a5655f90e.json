The killer is still at large, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one surviving witnessÃ¢â‚¬â€the boy whose family was killed before his eyes. Whoever committed the crimes wanted this boy to die: heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suffered more than one hundred knife wounds and lapsed into a state of shock. Desperate for information, Linna sees only one option: hypnotism. He enlists Dr. Erik Maria Bark to mesmerize the boy, hoping to discover the killer through his eyes.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the sort of work that Bark has sworn he would never do againÃ¢â‚¬â€ethically dubious and psychically scarring. When he breaks his promise and hypnotizes the victim, a long and terrifying chain of events begins to unfurl.\n\nThe Nightmare (#2): On a summer night, police recover the body of a young woman from an abandoned pleasure boat drifting around the Stockholm archipelago. Her lungs are filled with brackish water, and the forensics team is sure that she drowned. Why, then, is the pleasure boat still afloat, and why are there no traces of water on her clothes or body?\n\nThe next day, a man turns up dead in his state apartment in Stockholm, hanging from a lamp hook. All signs point to suicide, but the room has a high ceiling, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a single piece of furniture aroundÃ¢â‚¬â€nothing to climb on.\n\nJoona Linna begins to piece together the two mysteries, but the logistics are a mere prelude to a dizzying and dangerous course of events. At its core, the most frightening aspect of The Nightmare isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t its gruesome crimesÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the dark psychology of its characters, who show us how blind we are to our own motives.\n\nThe Fire Witness (#3): Flora Hansen calls herself a medium and makes a living by pretending to commune with the dead. But after a gruesome murder at a rural home for wayward girls, Hansen begins to suffer visions that are all too real. She calls the police, claiming to have seen a ghost, but only one detective puts aside his skepticism long enough to listen: Joona Linna.\nLinna has spent more time at the scene of the crime than any other detective would. The case seems obvious on the face of it: One of the girls at the home escaped in the middle of the night, leaving behind a bloody bed with a hammer under the pillow. But why does Hansen insist that the murder instrument was a stone, not a hammer? And whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the story behind the dark red grain of sand, almost like a splinter from a ruby, stuck beneath the dead girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fingernail? As Linna refuses to accept easy answers, his search leads him into darker, more violent territory, and finally to a shocking confrontation with a figure from his past.\n\nThe Sandman ( #4) Already a huge success internationally,The Sandman is the explosive, utterly gripping fourth book in the internationally bestselling Joona Linna Thriller series, which has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide. For readers of Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell, and Jo Nesbo.\nDuring a cold winter night in Stockholm a man is found walking alongside a railway bridge, suffering from hypothermia and legionella. After he's rushed to the hospital, it's discovered that, according to a death certificate, the man has been dead for over seven years. He is believed to be a victim of notorious serial killer Jurek Walter, who was arrested years ago by Detective Inspector Joona Linna and sentenced to a life of total isolation in forensic psychiatric care. As Joona Linna investigates where the &quot;dead man&quot; has been all these years, some unexpected evidence leads to the reopening of a cold case. Danger is imminent, and someone needs to get under the skin of the serial killer--fast--as they are running out of time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba00b145617ca775856dbaada5aee7a5655f90e","amp;dn":"Detective+Inspector+Joona+Linna+series+by+Lars+Kepler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba00b145617ca775856dbaada5aee7a5655f90e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,160,11,20,86,23,202,119,88,86,219,170,218,90,238,122,86,85,249,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
