This is the one day that all of the independently owned record stores come together with artists to celebrate the art of music. Iron and Wine is very excited to be involved in Record Store Day.\nA Record Store Day participating store is defined as a physical retailer whose product line consists of at least 50% music retail, whose company is not publicly traded and whose ownership is at least 70% located in the state of operation. (In other words, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re dealing with real, live, physical, indie record storesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not online retailers or corporate behemoths).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b73ebe110a93260826c71fa2c27bbb482bf1b71c","amp;dn":"Iron+%26+Wine+-+Norfolk+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b73ebe110a93260826c71fa2c27bbb482bf1b71c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,62,190,17,10,147,38,8,38,199,31,162,194,123,187,72,43,241,183,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
