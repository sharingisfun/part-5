After success in pop group New Edition, Brown began his solo career in 1987 and had a string of Top 10 Billboard hits, culminating in a Grammy Award. He was a pioneer of New Jack Swing music, a fusion of hip hop and R&amp;B. His second album, Don't Be Cruel, included popular songs such as &quot;My Prerogative&quot;. Brown is the ex-husband of R&amp;B singer Whitney Houston and starred in the reality show Being Bobby Brown.\n\nBobby Brown began his music career as a member of the R&amp;B boy band New Edition which he founded along with childhood friend Michael Bivins. He is the youngest member of the group since the inception. The group's hits with Brown included &quot;Candy Girl&quot;, &quot;Cool It Now&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Telephone Man&quot;. Brown was voted out of New Edition in 1986 when the other four members felt that their careers would be jeopardized by Bobby's lewd, line-crossing on-stage antics. Throughout the All for Love tour, he feuded with Ralph Tresvant and cut in on Tresvant's lead vocals. In 1996, Brown rejoined the group for New Edition's comeback album, Home Again. In the middle of the tour, he engaged in further racy on-stage antics. He extended his solo set and cut into Bell Biv Devoe's time. Once again, he left New Edition. In the fall of 2005, New Edition performed at BET's 25th Anniversary Special. The group performed a medley of its greatest hits, and even brought Bobby Brown on stage for a rendition of &quot;Mr. Telephone Man&quot;. It was later announced on BET and Inside Hollywood that Bobby had rejoined the group and would be on the next group album. In January 2006, New Edition announced that the group would launch a new album and tour in 2008. Bobby also appeared at a concert in Columbia, South Carolina that New Edition had filmed for a future dvd release.\n\nAfter leaving New Edition in 1985, Brown stayed with the group manager Steven Machat and Machat secured from MCA, the groups record label, a record deal guaranteed for Browns solo career if Brown agreed to leave the New Edition. MCA released his first solo album, King of Stage, in 1986. This album included &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, a minor hit which went to #1 on the Billboard R&amp;B charts and #57 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other than that, King of Stage did not garner much attention. However, Brown's next album, 1988's Don't Be Cruel with Machat overseeing the entire production and styling of Brown with Louil Silas, MCA's rep, rocketed him to super stardom. Working with the writing/producing team of L.A. Reid and Babyface, as well as Teddy Riley, Don't Be Cruel spawned five Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 singles: &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; (#8), &quot;Every Little Step&quot; (#3), &quot;Rock Wit' Cha&quot; (#7), &quot;My Prerogative&quot; (#1), and &quot;Roni&quot; (#3). The album would eventually be certified 8x platinum (8,000,000 units sold)[1].\n\nIn 1989, he contributed two songs (including &quot;On Our Own&quot;, which reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100) to the Ghostbusters II soundtrack, in addition to making a cameo in the film. Brown has subsequently dabbled in acting.\n\nIn between the &quot;On Our Own&quot; single and the release of Brown's next album, a remix album, Dance! Ya Know It! was released to capitalise on Brown's huge success at the time. A non-album &quot;megamix&quot; single was released to promote the project. The European dance-oriented version (sampling beats by Snap!) was titled &quot;The Freestyle Megamix&quot; and was a hit in the UK, reaching #14 on the Gallup charts. A more R'n'B oriented version called &quot;Every Little Hit Mix&quot; (b/w &quot;Roni) hit the Australian top 10\n\nBrown's third album, Bobby, did not arrive until 1992. It reached #2 on the Billboard album charts and produced the hit singles &quot;Humpin' Around&quot; (#3 on the Billboard Hot 100) and &quot;Good Enough&quot; (#7) as well as a smaller hit in &quot;Get Away&quot; (#14). The album was eventually certified 1x platinum (1,000,000 units sold)[1]. However, it did not come close to matching the album sales or singles chart success of its predecessor.\n\nBrown waited until 1997 to release his next (and to date, last) album of original material, Forever. The album was originally titled Bobby II and was supposed to be produced by such luminaries as R.Kelly, Teddy Riley, Sean Combs and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. However, Brown negotiated 100% creative control of the album[citation needed] and decided to write all the songs himself. It only managed to climb to #61 on the Billboard Hot 200 album charts and produced no charting singles.\n\nThere were hopes for a Brown comeback in 2002 when he appeared on the lead single &quot;Thug Lovin'&quot; from rapper Ja Rule's third studio album The Last Temptation. There were even talks that Brown had signed with Murder, Inc. (now known as The Inc) records.\n\nIn 2006 Brown appeared on &quot;Beautiful&quot;, the third single from Damian Marley's album Welcome to Jamrock.\n\n2010 Bobby Brown surprised his fans duetting with American R&amp;B and soul singer-songwriter, record producer, and actress Macy Gray on her new album titled &quot;The Sellout&quot; [[4]]. Together they did a song &quot;Real Love&quot;. Macy Gray divulge the pleasure of working with Bobby Brown to Essence Magazine.[[5]] on the project quoting, &quot;Actually came to the studio, since he doesn't live far, and knocked out his recording in two hours. We're friends and his one-year-old son is my godson. His fiance, is one of my best friends in the whole world. I met Bobby a long time ago, but we really got to know each other through her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Be Cruel 1988\n\n\nDon't Be Cruel is the second album by American R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown, released in 1988 on MCA Records. It includes the hit singles &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;My Prerogative&quot;, Brown's only solo number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Don't Be Cruel was the best-selling album in 1989, eventually going eight times Platinum. The album is the 33rd best selling album of the 80's, with sales of 7.6 million copies in the US alone. Don't Be Cruel was the best selling &quot;New Jack Swing&quot; album at the time until Michael Jackson's 1991 album &quot;Dangerous&quot; was released. Bobby Brown won the grammy for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance in 1990. Brown followed the release of his album with a 120-date world tour.\n\n&quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; appeared in popular video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on fictional New Jack Swing radio station CSR 103.9. My Prerogative was later covered by Britney Spears in 2004 on her Greatest Hits: My Prerogative album, and released as a single.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Cruel Prelude&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:39\n2.\t&quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:52 (#8 U.S.) (Babyface/Reid/Simmons)\n3.\t&quot;My Prerogative&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51 (#1 U.S.) (Brown/Griffin)\n4.\t&quot;Roni&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:58 (#3 U.S.)(Babyface)\n5.\t&quot;Rock Wit'cha&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49 (#7 U.S.) (Babyface/Reid)\n6.\t&quot;Every Little Step&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57 (#3 U.S.) (Babyface/Reid)\n7.\t&quot;I'll Be Good to You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25 (Brown/Griffin)\n8.\t&quot;Take It Slow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22 (Logan/Peters/White)\n9.\t&quot;All Day All Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40 (Peters/Sweet/Wadington/White)\n10.\t&quot;I Really Love You Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11 (Brown/Jones)\n11.\t&quot;Cruel Reprise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDance!...Ya Know It 1989\n\n\nDance!...Ya Know it! is a remix album by American singer Bobby Brown, released in 1989. The album features remixes of various recordings collected from his King of Stage and Don't Be Cruel albums including &quot;On Our Own&quot;, a single from the Ghostbusters II soundtrack. A Bobby Brown Megamix was released as a single to promote the album, however it was not included within the albums tracklisting. The U.K. and European version of the megamix was called &quot;The Bobby Brown Freestyle Megamix&quot; and was produced by Rita Liebrand. The Australian version was called &quot;The Every Little hit Mix&quot;, and was also released as a &quot;B side&quot; on the European version of the Roni single.\n\nReleased mostly to cash in on the enormous commercial success of Don't Be Cruel, Dance!...Ya Know It! was released by MCA Records. Production is mostly handled by producers Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid and Babyface with additional production handled by Larry Blackmon, Gene Griffin, and Robert Brookins.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Roni&quot; (Babyface, Darnell Bristol) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:12\n2.\t&quot;Rock Wit'cha&quot; (Babyface, Bristol) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n3.\t&quot;Girl Next Door&quot; (Melvin Wells) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:34\n4.\t&quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; (Babyface, Reid, Daryl Simmons) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:38\n5.\t&quot;Every Little Step&quot; (Babyface, Reid) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n6.\t&quot;On Our Own&quot; (Babyface, Reid, Simmons) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n7.\t&quot;Baby, I Wanna Tell You Something&quot; (Larry Blackmon, Tomi Jenkins, Nathan Leftenant) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n8.\t&quot;My Prerogative&quot; (Bobby Brown, Gene Griffin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n9.\t&quot;Seventeen&quot; (Robert Brookins, Tony Haynes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby 1992\n\n\nBobby is the third studio album (fourth overall) by American singer Bobby Brown, released in 1992 on MCA Records.
