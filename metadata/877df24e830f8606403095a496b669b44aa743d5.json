As he reaches for the toy, a tiny figure nips at his hand. There's delight on &quot;Keith's&quot; face and in his voice as he spots a small mouse next to his toy motorcycle. &quot;Keith&quot; wonders out loud if the mouse is responsible for his toy having been moved. When the mouse, (named Ralph) responds, verbally chiding &quot;Keith&quot; to finish his thought, &quot;Keith&quot; is amazed that the mouse can talk! With no other children living at the hotel or even in the neighborhood, and being an only child, &quot;Keith&quot; quickly strikes up a friendship with &quot;Ralph&quot; and allows the mouse to ride his toy motorcycle around the bedroom as well as out in the hall of the hotel, which is just the first of a few adventures for &quot;Ralph&quot;.\n\n\nSorry For the VHS rip all i had!!
