Hot on the tail of Richard K. Morgan's searing comics debut comes the further dark exploits of Natasha Romanova, the original Black Widow. Some say she's a traitor, some say she's a murdererÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and what most say about her isn't even printable. But nobody denies that the former Cold War spy is a force to be reckoned with. The last man foolish enough to send killers after her paid the highest price, but his friends on Capitol Hill will ensure that Natasha doesn't get off easyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and not even Col. Nick Fury can protect her this time. Meanwhile, the survivors of Natasha's last tirade start coming back to haunt herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and they're starting to join forces. Also featuring a guest appearance by Daredevil! Richard K. Morgan is the Phillip K. Dick Award-winning sci-fi author of Altered Carbon, Broken Angels, and Market Forces. Returning to BLACK WIDOW is comics legend Bill Sienkiewicz (ELEKTRA: ASSASSIN), joined by Eisner Award-nominated artist Sean Phillips (Sleeper). Read the red-hot sequel to the limited series praised by Entertainment Weekly, Ain't It Cool News, SFX Magazine and more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b962a2506db1f389da87e01e8a0383ab0ece5482","amp;dn":"Black+Widow+-+The+Things+They+Say+About+Her+%2801+-+06%29+%282006%29+%28An","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b962a2506db1f389da87e01e8a0383ab0ece5482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,98,162,80,109,177,243,137,218,135,224,30,138,3,131,171,14,206,84,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
