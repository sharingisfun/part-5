Narrated by Golden Globe nominee Christopher Plummer (Best Supporting Actor, AMERICAN TRAGEDY, 2000), it&amp;#039;s the bold and powerful story of Jesus as told by his disciple John. The best-loved but least understood of the gospels, John presents a uniquely human portrait of courage and passion encompassing Jesus&amp;#039; entire three-year ministry, the final years of his life. Intimate and reflective, The Gospel of John offers an unparalleled opportunity to experience the incomparable life and times of Jesus Christ.\n\n\nVisit http://prince213.blogspot.com/ for more...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d46e51ee8cde06d5dc66a2a4d43211db3dfa7536","amp;dn":"The+Gospel+of+John+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d46e51ee8cde06d5dc66a2a4d43211db3dfa7536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,110,81,238,140,222,6,213,220,102,162,164,212,50,17,219,61,250,117,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
