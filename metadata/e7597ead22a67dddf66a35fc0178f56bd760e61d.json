Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second volume of QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Greatest Hits appeared a decade after the first; a decade after the group started its slow shift from international superstars toward ruling the world that existed outside of the United States. Apart from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Under PressureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Radio Ga Ga,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ all of the 17 singles here did not crack the American Top 40, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re well-known throughout the world, particularly the operatic anthems Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Kind of Magic,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Want It All,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Want to Break Free,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Wants to Live Forever.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Generally, the songs here favor melodrama to untrammeled rock &amp; roll, which means while thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing here that hits as hard as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tie Your Mother DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also nothing as light on its feet as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crazy Little Thing Called Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ either. This is not necessarily a bad thing: nobody scaled the dramatic heights like Queen, and this captures their pomp &amp; circumstance at its most polished. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7597ead22a67dddf66a35fc0178f56bd760e61d","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Greatest+Hits+II+%5B1991%5D%5B2011%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7597ead22a67dddf66a35fc0178f56bd760e61d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,89,126,173,34,166,125,221,246,106,53,252,1,120,245,107,215,96,230,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
