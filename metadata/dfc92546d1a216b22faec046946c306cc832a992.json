Though anxiety and panic are sometimes best treated with drug therapy, an effective standard for handling these debilitating disorders for the long haul is a repertoire of anxiety-busting skills that you'll find in this book. You'll develop an amazing &quot;hardy-personality&quot; approach to everyday life that bucks adversity. You'll see how the best way to conquer anxiety is to know how to respond to it. Several solutions include diaphragmatic breathing, exposure therapy, positive self-talk, and behavior-modification therapy. No More Panic Attacks offers concrete advice on ways to surmount obstacles that will allow you to lead a more fulfilled life. The author is a family practice physician who, having struggled with anxiety herself, devised a 30-day plan that targets panic and anxiety.\n\nPaperback: 253 pages\nPublisher: New Page Books (August 1, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1564146081\nISBN-13: 978-1564146083\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
