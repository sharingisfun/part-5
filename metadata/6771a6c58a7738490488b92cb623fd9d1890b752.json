While the band did record original material, they were best known for their loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements of contemporary pop songs, blowing them up to epic proportions and bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze. Originally, Vanilla Fudge was a blue-eyed soul cover band called the Electric Pigeons, who formed on Long Island, NY, in 1965. Organist Mark Stein, bassist Tim Bogert, and drummer Joey Brennan soon shortened their name to the Pigeons and added guitarist Vince Martell. They built a following by gigging extensively up and down the East Coast, and earned extra money by providing freelance in-concert backing for girl groups. In early 1966, the group recorded a set of eight demos that were released several years later as While the Whole World Was Eating Vanilla Fudge, credited to Mark Stein &amp; the Pigeons. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.You Keep Me Hangin' On\n02.Where Is My Mind\n03.The Look Of Love\n04.Ticket To Ride\n05.Come By Day, Come By Night\n06.Take Me For A Little While\n07.That's What Makes A Man\n08.Season Of The Witch\n09.Shotgun\n10.Thoughts\n11.Faceless People\n12.Good Good Lovin'\n13.Some Velvet Morning\n14.I Can't Make It Alone\n15.Lord In The Country\n16.Need Love\n17.Street Walking Woman\n18.All In Your Mind\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6771a6c58a7738490488b92cb623fd9d1890b752","amp;dn":"Vanilla+Fudge+-+Psychedelic+Sundae+Best+Of+%281993%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6771a6c58a7738490488b92cb623fd9d1890b752","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,113,166,197,138,119,56,73,4,136,185,44,182,35,253,157,24,144,183,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
