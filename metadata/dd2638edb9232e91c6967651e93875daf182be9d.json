And yet hip hop is the source of some of the most exciting developments in verse today. The media uproar in response to its controversial lyrical content has obscured hip hop's revolution of poetic craft and experience: Only in rap music can the beat of a song render poetic meter audible, allowing an MC's wordplay to move a club-full of eager listeners.\nExamining rap history's most memorable lyricists and their inimitable techniques, literary scholar Adam Bradley argues that we must understand rap as poetry or miss the vanguard of poetry today. Book of Rhymes explores America&amp;'s least understood poets, unpacking their surprisingly complex craft, and according rap poetry the respect it deserves.\n\nReview\nBoston Globe\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[Bradley] lays out a nuanced, academically rigorous argument that the best hip-hop deserves attention as genuine artistryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦He traces the word rhythm from the Greek rheo, or flow. Biggie had flow; Jay-Z has flow. For an English professor, Adam Bradley got some flow of his own.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nDallas Morning News \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ExcellentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Where so many hip-hop studies lean heavily on politics and sociology, Book of Rhymes is a welcome and thorough exploration of rap aesthetics that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to be learned.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHenry Louis Gates, Jr.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As comfortable in the company of Jay-Z as he is with John Donne, Adam Bradley is a visionary critic, skillful and wise. His Book of Rhymes is a tour de force, brilliantly renovating hip hop criticism as he rescues the forgotten vanguard of American poetry.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd2638edb9232e91c6967651e93875daf182be9d","amp;dn":"Book+of+Rhymes+-+The+Poetics+of+Hip+Hop+%5BAdam+Bradley%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd2638edb9232e91c6967651e93875daf182be9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,38,56,237,185,35,46,145,198,150,118,81,233,56,117,218,241,130,190,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
