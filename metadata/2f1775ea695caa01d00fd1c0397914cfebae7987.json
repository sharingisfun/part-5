Plant travelled to\r\nACL as part of his &quot;Southern Journey,&quot; visiting the &quot;places that gave birth to so much\r\nof the music I love,&quot; with a select run of live dates dubbed the &quot;Blues...Roots and Hollers&quot;\r\ntour. The music icon celebrated the American South as a continuation of the eclectic soulful\r\njourney he began since leaving Led Zeppelin decades ago. He has spent many years exploring \r\nAmericana music and America itself, traveling though the U.S. and collaborating with roots \r\nmusicians, including Alison Krauss for 2009's six-time Grammy-winning album 'Raising Sand'. \r\nPlant's acclaimed 10th solo album, 2014's 'Lullaby and...The Ceaseless Roar', combines his\r\nlove of everything from American country blues and rockabilly to British folk, Moroccan trance\r\nmusic and West African griot into a vision all his own. Joined by his diverse, versatile six-piece\r\nband the Sensational Space Shifters for this appearance, Plant adds, &quot;Having just begun work on our\r\nnew album, we thought we'd take time out to raise a little sand and welcome springtime with one \r\nmore adventure, another celebration of life and song.&quot;\r\n\r\nSetlist:\r\nThe Lemon Song \r\nRainbow\r\nBlack Dog\r\nTurn It Up\r\nSpoonful (Willie Dixon cover) \r\nIn the Mood\r\nNo Place to Go (Howlin' Wolf cover) &gt;\r\nDazed and Confused\r\nBabe, I'm Gonna Leave You (Joan Baez cover)\r\nLittle Maggie (traditional)\r\nFixin' to Die (Bukka White cover)\r\nI Just Want to Make Love to You (Willie Dixon cover) &gt;\r\nWhole Lotta Love &gt;\r\nHey Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley cover) &gt;\r\nWhole Lotta Love\r\n\r\nEncore:\r\nRainbow (played again due to a &quot;mistake&quot; when originally played)\r\nSatan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down (traditional) &gt;\r\nIn My Time of Dying\r\nRock and Roll\r\n\r\nTRT = 01:34:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f1775ea695caa01d00fd1c0397914cfebae7987","amp;dn":"Robert+Plant+-+2016-03-21+Austin%2C+TX+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f1775ea695caa01d00fd1c0397914cfebae7987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,23,117,234,105,92,170,1,208,15,209,192,57,121,20,207,235,174,121,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
