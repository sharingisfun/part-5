The band is best known for the songs &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;, &quot;Queens of Noise&quot;, &quot;Rock n Roll&quot;, &quot;Neon Angels (On the Road to Ruin)&quot;, and &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot;.\n\nThe Runaways were formed in late 1975 by drummer Sandy West and rhythm guitarist Joan Jett. They had introduced themselves (on separate occasions) to producer Kim Fowley stating their ideas to form an all-girl band. Fowley, who was always looking for the next big thing, gave Jett's phone number to West. The two met on their own to discuss the possibilities. After rehearsing together, the pair contacted Fowley to let him hear the results. Fowley then helped the girls find the other members. Although Fowley would continue to take credit in the press for creating the band and the music, he would later admit, &quot;I didn't put The Runaways together, I had an idea, they had ideas, we all met, there was combustion and out of five different versions of that group came the five girls who were the ones that people liked&quot;.\n\nStarting as a power trio with singer/bassist Micki Steele, The Runaways began the party and club circuit around Los Angeles. In 1975, they added 16-year-old lead guitarist Lita Ford and lead singer Cherie Currie to the lineup. Singer/bassist Micki Steele left the group, later resurfacing in The Bangles. A local bassist named Peggy Foster took over on bass but also left after a month. Finally, Jackie Fox (who had originally auditioned for the lead guitar spot) was added on bass, and the line up was complete.\n\n\nTHE RUNAWAYS (1976)\n\n1. Cherry Bomb\n2. You Drive Me Wild\n3.
