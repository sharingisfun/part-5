She's a long-time member of the Avengers and was a founding member and the only leader of the short-lived Los Angeles-based superteam: The Champions.\n\nYelena Belova became the second Black Widow after training with the same spymasters that trained Natasha Romanoff.\n\nBlack Widow was created by Stan Lee, Don Rico and Don Heck. She made her first appearance as a villain in Tales of Suspense #52 in April 1964. Her first appearances in comics were as a Soviet spy adversary to the newly created hero Iron Man.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1de904e7c0f44257835e178297fd6915a26297b4","amp;dn":"Black+Widow+%28v1+-+v8+%2B+Appearances+%26amp%3B+Extras%29+%281964+-+Ongoing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1de904e7c0f44257835e178297fd6915a26297b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,233,4,231,192,244,66,87,131,94,23,130,151,253,105,21,162,98,151,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
