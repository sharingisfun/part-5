Nobody had upped his album yet, so here it is.\n\nReview from PUNCHLINE Magazine:\n\nAnthony Jeselnik writes great jokesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ plain and simple. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a master of the one-two punch. Now, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the only game in town when it comes to slinging one liners, but heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the best, and hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why: JeselnikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stand-up embodies one of the most distinct, specific, unflinching comic personas on the scene today. And his Comedy Central album, Shakespeare proves this endlessly. The Pittsburgh native and former Late Night With Jimmy Fallon writer has been on the rise for the last five years, becoming a favorite of both the indie and club comedy circuits. This debut album, available digitally, is a collection of masterfully crafted jokes strung together by his well-honed, nearly-sociopathic self-assured bravado. On Shakespeare Jeselnik reflects, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis chick is trying to get me fired, because she claims IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been giving her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“inappropriate massagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in the office. Well I said good luck with that, sweetheart. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even work here.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ When you hear the bit, you think crack up and think, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhey, that is a great joke.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ A few seconds later, Jeselnik says those exact words on the album. Commenting on his own joke gets almost as big a laugh as the joke itself. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on purpose. You see, this comedian is all about verbal economy; thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no idle chit-chat on this album. Even his segues and taglines are well-crafted jokes. The downside of listening to a comedian thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œjokeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (I hate that term too) is that you miss out on hearing a distinct voice. It can become more about ending a joke with the right twist than getting across the comedianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal perspective. Fortunately, Jeselnik avoids this. The jokes get you in the door, but the thing that keeps you engaged from start to finish is the fact that he never breaks character. Or is it even a character? ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impossible to tell whether heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being ironic, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s part of what makes him so fucking funny. Personally, I choose to believe heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being ironic; it makes me feel less slimy about laughing so hard. [audio:http://www.punchlinemagazine.com/audio/jeselnik.mp3] If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re wondering, the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s odd title comes from the long bit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a rarity for this quick-joke pro ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that makes up the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final track. He tells a story about a crowd at a show that couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t handle one of his especially tasteless jokes. No doubt, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s probably a lot of people that would agree with that disgusted group of people; but Anthony Jeselnik doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care. And, neither do I. \n\n\nAnthony Jeselnik - Shakespeare - 2010\n\n1. Pleased To Meet You  \t 2:54\t\t\n2. Standards And Practices \t 4:02\t\t\n3. School Sucks \t         4:34\t\t\n4.
