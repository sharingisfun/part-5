These videos will give you problem-solving knowledge, techniques and confidence to solve scenarios like those given on the exams.\n\nMeant to compliment our Cisco CCIE Certification Package, trainer Jeremy Cioara goes through a networking scenario in real-time with you. He starts at setup, then covers diagnosing the problem, implementing an effective solution and debugging along the way.\n\nBecause the videos follow Cioara through the problem solving process in real-time, it is easy to learn the thought processes behind his techniques for identifying and solving network problems. By understanding why he solves problems in the ways that he does, you\\&amp;#039;ll be better at coming up with your own solutions for new problems that you come across.\n\nThese videos map to the exam objectives for the CCIE lab exam, but they are just as useful on the job as on the exam. With the knowledge contained in these videos, you will become better at running networks, whether you are preparing for CCIE certification or not.\n\nThis series consists of 20 videos that provide more than 11 hours of instruction. It is recommended that you have the skills and knowledge discussed in the Cisco CCIE Certification Package prior to viewing this video series.\n\nNote: This training covers all exam objectives to fully prepare you for the content, hardware and operating systems update to the CCIE Routing &amp; Switching lab exam, released by Cisco, January 2006.\n\nContents: CCIE Video Practice Lab\n\n- CCIE Practice Labs Introduction\n- CCIE Lab Setup\n- Bridging and Switching: Frame Relay\n- Bridging and Switching: 3550\n- IGP Protocols: OSPF Part 1\n- IGP Protocols: OSPF Part 2\n- IGP Protocols: RIPv2\n- IGP Protocols: EIGRP\n- EGP Protocols: BGP Part 1\n- EGP Protocols: BGP Part 2\n- EGP Protocols: BGP Part 3\n- ISDN: Connectivity and Dial Restrictions\n- Cisco IOS Features: DHCP\n- Cisco IOS Features: Redundant Routing\n- Cisco IOS Features: SNMP\n- Cisco IOS Features: NTP\n- Cisco IOS Features: Miscellaneous Tasks\n- Quality of Service\n- Multicast\n- Security\n\nCisco is a registered trademark of Cisco Systems, Inc. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735f9519e0ed7b4564ab46c245e1cc1f4b8ec4f6","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+-+CISCO+-+CCIE+-+VIDEO+PRACTICE+LAB.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735f9519e0ed7b4564ab46c245e1cc1f4b8ec4f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,95,149,25,224,237,123,69,100,171,70,194,69,225,204,31,75,142,196,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
