Set in the &quot;present day,&quot; the story follows Bo (Seann William Scott) and Luke (Johnny Knoxville) as they cruise around Hazzard County and wreck havoc in their classic 1969 Dodge Charger. Together with their scantily clad cousin Daisy (Jessica Simpson) and moonshining Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), the two good old boys battle the corrupt county commissioner Boss Hog (Burt Reynolds) when he and local Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane (M.C. Gainey) threaten to take away the family farm. John O'Brien has the lone writer's credit on the film, though additional uncredited rewrites were handled by the Broken Lizard gang. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 47 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd7537ec0169bb3af95bdeb1055103ea2dd07e8","amp;dn":"The+Dukes+of+Hazzard%282005%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd7537ec0169bb3af95bdeb1055103ea2dd07e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,215,83,126,192,22,155,179,175,149,189,235,16,85,16,62,162,221,7,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
