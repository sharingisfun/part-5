We have guides to all aspects of mastering including an introduction to traditional mastering (on p6) plus lots of other different aspects of the subject within specific DAWs. But weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve designed these tutorials so that you can take knowledge from them and apply it to whatever DAW you use. For example, Liam OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Mullane has written a guide to mastering for club music in Live, but you can easily apply those principles to Logic, Cubase or whatever you use.\n\nSimilarly, Mike HillierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in-depth tutorials on mid/side processing in Pro Tools will certainly leave you with enough transferable knowledge on what can be a tricky subject. Elsewhere we have a buyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guide on studio monitors, producer and mastering engineer interviews, plus reviews of the latest studio gear, with the emphasis on the mastering process.\n\nSo I hope you gain enough from this special issue to ultimately make your productions more robust, solid and professional (but not necessarily louder)..\n\nEnjoy the issue, and happy mastering.\n\nIn this issue:\n\nThe complete lowdown on the mastering process\nStep-by-step tutorials for every major DAW\nProduction tips and tricks from the professionals\nThe best studio equipment rounded up and rated\nRoom to studio: THE guide to DIY acoustics\n\n\n\n\nPDF - 132 pages\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musictech.net/2014/03/musictech-focus-mastering-2014/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musictech.net/2014/03/musictech-focus-mastering-2014/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
