One night in winter, Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), orphan and master-mechanic, attempts to rob a fortress-like mansion on the Upper West Side. Though he thinks the house is empty, the daughter of the house is home. Thus begins the love between Peter, a middle-aged Irish burglar, and Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay), a young girl, who is dying. Soundtrack features music by Hans Zimmer and Rupert Gregson-Williams and the song Miracle performed by KT Tunstall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack |   Start  |  Length  | Start sector | End sector\n   ---------------------------------------------------------\n       1  |  0:00.00 |  6:08.21 |         0    |    27620  \n       2  |  6:08.21 |  2:28.74 |     27621    |    38794  \n       3  |  8:37.20 |  2:04.08 |     38795    |    48102  \n       4  | 10:41.28 |  2:32.04 |     48103    |    59506  \n       5  | 13:13.32 |  1:42.52 |     59507    |    67208  \n       6  | 14:56.09 |  6:42.51 |     67209    |    97409  \n       7  | 21:38.60 |  2:19.50 |     97410    |   107884  \n       8  | 23:58.35 |  4:14.00 |    107885    |   126934  \n       9  | 28:12.35 |  4:00.51 |    126935    |   144985  \n      10  | 32:13.11 |  3:46.03 |    144986    |   161938  \n      11  | 35:59.14 |  7:41.68 |    161939    |   196581  \n      12  | 43:41.07 |  1:35.43 |    196582    |   203749  \n      13  | 45:16.50 |  4:04.59 |    203750    |   222108  \n      14  | 49:21.34 | 10:06.44 |    222109    |   267602  \n      15  | 59:28.03 |  4:32.24 |    267603    |   288026\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
