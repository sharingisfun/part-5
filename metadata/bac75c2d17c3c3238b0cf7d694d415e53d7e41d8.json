Its purpose: to capture and abduct a high-value jihadist arms buyer. Its authors: an ambitious Foreign Office Minister, a private defense contractor who is also his bosom friend, and a shady American CIA operative of the evangelical far-right. So delicate is the operation that even the MinisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal private secretary, Toby Bell, is not cleared for it.\n\nThree years later, a disgraced Special Forces Soldier delivers a message from the dead. Was Operation Wildlife the success it was cracked up to beÃ¢â‚¬â€or a human tragedy that was ruthlessly covered up? Summoned by Sir Christopher (Ã¢â‚¬Å“KitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) Probyn, retired British diplomat, to his decaying Cornish manor house, and closely observed by KitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, Emily, Toby must choose between his conscience and duty to his Service. If the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing, how can he keep silent?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Le CarrÃƒÂ© further establishes himself as a master of a new, shockingly realistic kind of noir.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Booklist (Starred)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is a guaranteed hair-raising cerebral fright, especially for anyone who enjoyed Robert HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Ghost or who just knows his or her email account has been hacked.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Library Journal (Starred)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Le CarrÃƒÂ© focuses on the moral rot and creeping terror barely concealed by the affable old-boy blather that marks the pillars of the intelligence community.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus Reviews (Starred)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A great story in sterling prose.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bac75c2d17c3c3238b0cf7d694d415e53d7e41d8","amp;dn":"John+LeCarre+-+A++Delicate+Truth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bac75c2d17c3c3238b0cf7d694d415e53d7e41d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,199,92,45,23,195,195,35,139,12,247,214,148,212,21,229,61,126,65,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
