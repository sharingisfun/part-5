Jennifer Browne reveals the common denominator present in almost all chronic digestive angst: food. What we choose to fuel ourselves with has a direct impact on every part of our bodies, starting with the digestive system. Browne urges us to own responsibility for our own health and make conscientious decisions regarding the cause and effect foods have on our digestive tracts. Written in frank, humorous laymenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terms and sharing her own personal success story along with othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Browne passionately educates her readers on why a plant-based diet is the only prescription necessary for a happy, healthy tummy. Discover the direct correlation between digestive trauma and factory farming; the incredible benefits of juicing, fermenting, and sprouting food; the reason why GMOs lead to IBS; and what ingredients really just translate to Ã¢â‚¬Å“sugarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“lab-created chemical.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Heal Your Gut is an easy read that is truly important and highly informative for anyone who has ever dreamed of a perfectly functioning digestive system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4febe78f62b501ebee517e5fbac6d55e350fb53","amp;dn":"Happy+Healthy+Gut+-+The+Natural+Diet+Solution+to+Curing+IBS+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4febe78f62b501ebee517e5fbac6d55e350fb53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,254,190,120,246,43,80,30,190,229,23,229,251,172,109,85,227,80,251,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
