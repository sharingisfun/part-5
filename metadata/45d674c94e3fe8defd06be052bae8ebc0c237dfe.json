Although its recording career and popularity peaked in the early '80s, Jefferson Starship continues to tour as of 2011. The group is a spinoff from Jefferson Airplane and evolved from a 1970 science fiction-themed concept album by then-Airplane member Paul Kantner entitled Blows Against the Empire. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatinum Gold Collection 2003\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nLayin' On The Line\nJane\nStranger\nMiracles\nCount On Me\nRunaway\nRide The Tiger\nPlay On Love\nLove Too Good\nFreedom At Point Zero\nSave Your Love\nHot Water\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45d674c94e3fe8defd06be052bae8ebc0c237dfe","amp;dn":"Jefferson+Starship+-+Platinum+Gold+Collection+2003+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45d674c94e3fe8defd06be052bae8ebc0c237dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,214,116,201,78,63,232,222,253,6,190,5,43,174,142,188,12,35,125,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
