Carol, a typical upper middle-class housewife, begins to complain of vague symptoms of illness. She &quot;doesn&amp;#039;t feel right,&quot; has unexplained headaches, congestion, a dry cough, nosebleeds, vomiting, and trouble breathing. Her family doctor treats her concerns dismissively and suggests a psychiatrist. Eventually, an allergist tells her that she has Environmental Illness. Her body is rebelling against the overload that her immune system has to deal with, as she is continually exposed to all of the chemicals that we inhale, ingest, and absorb daily. The pollution in our air, pesticides on our food, and toxins in our water, are collectively overwhelming her defenses. The ubiquitous sprays, creams, and emollients used to beautify have become deadly poisons to her. In essence, she has become allergic to the Twentieth Century. She sees Wrenwood as her only salvation, a New Agey center run (quite profitably) by Peter, a clichÃƒÂ©d, easy-talking, demagogic guru. Unsettling and ambiguous, we are never sure about each character&amp;#039;s hidden agenda, as they revolve around Carol, a timid, frightened pawn, overwhelmed by her condition.&quot;\n\n\n\nFILE_NAME                      Safe (Todd Haynes, 1995).avi\nFILE_SIZE                      733,798,400\nCONT_AUDIO_STREAM_COUNT        1\nCONT_BASETYPE                  AVI(.AVI)\nCONT_BYTES_MISSING             0\nCONT_INTERLEAVE_ALIGN          Aligned\nCONT_INTERLEAVE_PRELOAD        496\nCONT_INTERLEAVE_TIME           33\nCONT_SUBTYPE                   OpenDML (AVI v2.0), \nCONT_TOTAL_BITRATE             0\nVIDEO_BITRATE                  735\nVIDEO_CODEC_NAME               DivX 5.1.1 (Maupiti)\nVIDEO_CODEC_TYPE               DX50\nVIDEO_DAR                      1.818\nVIDEO_DURATION                 1:58:51\nVIDEO_FRAME_COUNT              213687\nVIDEO_FRAMES_PER_SEC           29.970\nVIDEO_MPEG4                    MPEG-4\nVIDEO_MPEG4_BVOP               B-VOP\nVIDEO_MPEG4_GMC                GMC\nVIDEO_MPEG4_QPEL               QPel\nVIDEO_PAR                      1.000\nVIDEO_PICS_PER_SEC             29.970\nVIDEO_QF                       0.109\nVIDEO_SAR                      1.818\nVIDEO_SIZE_X                   640\nVIDEO_SIZE_Y                   352\nAUDIO_BITRATE                  75\nAUDIO_BITRATE_TYPE             VBR\nAUDIO_CHANNEL_COUNT            2\nAUDIO_CODEC                    0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE              44100\n\nSpoken Language\t\t\tEnglish\nSubtitles Language\t\tEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afb0f15dc11161fbc5670186594a809a4de94bd6","amp;dn":"Safe+%28Todd+Haynes%2C+1995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afb0f15dc11161fbc5670186594a809a4de94bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,176,241,93,193,17,97,251,197,103,1,134,89,74,128,154,77,233,75,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
