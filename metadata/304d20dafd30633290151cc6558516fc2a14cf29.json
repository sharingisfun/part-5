She has been complaining of pain in the upper part of her abdomen and generalized itching. Her daughter has also noticed a yellowish discolouration of her skin. The symptoms started a week ago and are gradually getting worse. You have been assigned her initial assessment...\n\n100 Cases in Surgery presents 100 scenarios requiring surgical treatment commonly seen by medical students and junior doctors in the emergency department or outpatient clinic. A succinct summary of the patient's history, examination, and initial investigationsÃ¢â‚¬â€including photographs where relevantÃ¢â‚¬â€is followed by questions on the diagnosis and management of each case. The answer includes a detailed discussion on each topic, with further illustration where appropriate, providing an essential revision aid as well as a practical guide for students and junior doctors. \n\nMaking speedy and appropriate clinical decisions, and choosing the best course of action to take as a result, is one of the most important and challenging parts of training to become a doctor. These true-to-life cases will teach students and junior doctors to recognize important surgical conditions, and help to develop their diagnostic and management skills.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:304d20dafd30633290151cc6558516fc2a14cf29","amp;dn":"100+Cases+in+Surgery%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"304d20dafd30633290151cc6558516fc2a14cf29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,77,32,218,253,48,99,50,144,21,28,198,85,133,22,252,42,20,207,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
