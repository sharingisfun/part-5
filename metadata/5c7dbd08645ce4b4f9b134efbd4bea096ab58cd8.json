El-Metwally\n\nProduct Description\nIn our world of seemingly unlimited computing, numerous analytical approaches to the estimation of stress, strain, and displacementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including analytical, numerical, physical, and analog techniquesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½have greatly advanced the practice of engineering. Combining theory and experimentation, computer simulation has emerged as a third path for engineering design and performance evaluation. As a result, structural engineers working in the practical world of engineering must apply and, ideally, thrive on these idealizations of science-based theories.\n\nAnalyzing the major achievements in the field, Understanding Structural Engineering demonstrates how to bring science to engineering design. This book illustrates:\nKey conceptual breakthroughs in structural engineering in the twentieth century\nThe science of structural engineering from basic mechanics and computing to the ultimate process of engineering design\nHow engineers implement theory to practice through idealizations and simplifications\nCurrent and future trends in structural engineering\n\nDevelopments and advancements in structural engineering hinge on a few key breakthroughs in concepts, simplifications and idealizations. Simplification, inherent in the art of structural engineering, is a key theme throughout this book. But the authors go further. Their clear explanations of the role and impact of new, science-based developments shows you how to put them into practice.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 271 pages\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (May 24, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439827109\nISBN-13: 978-1439827109","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7dbd08645ce4b4f9b134efbd4bea096ab58cd8","amp;dn":"Understanding+Structural+Engineering%3A+From+Theory+to+Practice+by","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c7dbd08645ce4b4f9b134efbd4bea096ab58cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,125,189,8,100,92,228,180,249,177,52,239,189,75,234,9,106,181,140,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
