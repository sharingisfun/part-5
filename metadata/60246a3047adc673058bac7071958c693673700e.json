Perhaps her name rings a bell from the work she put into the Girls With Guitars trio alongside Cassie Taylor and Dani Wilde. Even still, blues fans will likely remember the young Kansas City star from the vocals she contributed to Devon AllmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover of the Tom Petty-Stevie Nicks classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stop DragginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ My Heart AroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for AllmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2013 album Turquoise. Whatever the connection, Fish fans will be excited to learn that the release of her sophomore album Black Wind HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is just around the corner.\nProduced by Royal Southern Brotherhood co-founder Mike Zito and featuring the talents of Paul Thorn, Johnny Sansone, Bo Thomas, and Royal Southern Brotherhood band mates Charlie Wooton and Yonrico Scott, Black Wind HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is chock-full of talent from some of modern bluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ best. Fish earned writing credits on 11 of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 12 tracks, but for Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Been Talking?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she offers a nod to HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wolf in a harmonica-heavy track that sounds more like a classic itself than a tribute. Meanwhile, several of FishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original tracks provide snapshots of FishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own vast range of influences and experiences. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Got mouths to feed, my word to keep / IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on the run with miles to go,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fish sings on the jaunty Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miles to Go,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a lyric that reflects the timeless lifestyle of the touring musician. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title track similarly samples the narrative tradition of classic blues as Fish sings of repentance and retribution, a style she revisits on the country-tinged Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last September.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lay It DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ jumps in as the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s runaway hit, a song with a dependable rocking beat that inspires a sweetly simple guitar lick and strong vocal bursts from Fish. With a discreet reference to Runaway woven into the lyrics, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lay It DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stands as evidence of FishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continued songwriting prowess and vocal skill as one of bluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recognized rising talents. In a pleasant close to the summer season, Black Wind HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will be available in the U.S. on September 10 and throughout Europe on September 20.
