Capitalism in the Real World\nBy Noam Chomsky\n\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\n\nOn Free Market Fantasies: Capitalism in the Real World, noted linguist and political dissident, Noam Chomsky, steps into the ring to personally debunk the myth of the free market by pulling back the curtain on the Wizards of Dollars in American society. He puts forth a powerful one-man rebuttal to what he calls the \\'\\'cult of the free market.\\'\\' For a scrawny, bespectacled, old scholar, the result packs a devastating wallop.\n\nAmid all the details and statistics that Chomsky presents to back up his views, though, there is a simple, but profound, point at the heart of the argument: There is no such thing as a \\'\\'free market.\\'\\' Never has been. Never will be. In fact, the government has always interceded in the economy, most consistently on the side of large corporations against the interests of the majority of American citizens. The important question, then, is not whether or not the government should intercede in the economy, but, rather, on whose behalf they should act and toward what end. Chomsky makes clear that \\'\\'free markets\\'\\' are intended only for the poor.\n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War. He is the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the \\'\\'most cited living author\\'\\'. Chomsky is also the author of over 150 books.\n\n\nRunning Time: 53:56\n\n\n\n1  The Real Market\n2  The Massachusetts Example\n3  Gingrich\n4  The Reagan Legacy\n5  The Washington Consensus\n6  The Pentagon System\n7  Crime And Punishment\n8  Chain Gangs\n9  Prison Labor\n10 Devolution\n11 Reform\n12 Subsidies\n13 Taxes\n14 Deregulation\n15 State Criminal Behavior\n16 Economic Miracles\n17 Property Rights\n18 Trade Myths\n19 Democracy And Free Markets\n20 Entrepeneurial Values\n21 Mysterious Wisdom Of The Market\n22 Grand Vision Of The Future\n23 Role Of The Propaganda System\n24 Corporate Feeding Frenzy\n25 Downsizing\n26 Class War\n27 The Casino Economy\n28 What We Can Do\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c15fa0390df3080f968aee8963feb3c1276cef6","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+-+Free+Market+Fantasies.+Capitalism+in+the+Real+Wor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c15fa0390df3080f968aee8963feb3c1276cef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,21,250,3,144,223,48,128,249,104,174,232,150,63,235,60,18,118,206,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
