Veteran trappers and predator hunters from across the United States and beyond opened up their family cookbooks and shared their most delicious creations in this one-of-a-kind recipe guide. A bonus introductory chapter by biologist Serge Lariviere, a Trapper &amp; Predator Caller field editor, details how to safely prepare and cook furbearers. After making some of these unique dishes for your own table, you'll never let the meat from these unconventional wild-game animals go to waste again. Are you ready to eat like a mountain man?\n\n\nBy Jared Blohm\nPublished by Krause Publications, F+W Media in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 128 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0caae99980240f5224684794eb7e6718bf455f1a","amp;dn":"The+Mountain+Man+Cookbook%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0caae99980240f5224684794eb7e6718bf455f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,170,233,153,128,36,15,82,36,104,71,148,235,126,103,24,191,69,95,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
