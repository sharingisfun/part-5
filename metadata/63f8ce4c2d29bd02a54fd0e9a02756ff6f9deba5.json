The major exceptions to the latter complaint, the songs which do conjure memories of the movie, are the two tracks from Elmer Bernstein&amp;#039;s score, Mick Smiley&amp;#039;s &quot;Magic,&quot; which played a major role in the film, and the witty Ray Parker, Jr. theme song, &quot;Ghostbusters,&quot; which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Song. (He lost to Stevie Wonder&amp;#039;s &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You.&quot;) Years later, Parker&amp;#039;s refrain of &quot;Who you gonna call?&quot; has remained a part of the cultural lexicon. As for Bernstein&amp;#039;s contribution, he has a tendency to write film music characterized by eerie keyboard meanderings which add little to the scenes he writes for.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Ghostbusters - Ray Parker, Jr. [4:06]\n02 - Cleanin&amp;#039; Up the Town - The BusBoys [2:59]\n03 - Savin&amp;#039; the Day - Alessi Brothers [3:23]\n04 - In the Name of Love - Thompson Twins [3:20]\n05 - I Can Wait Forever - Air Supply [5:10]\n06 - Hot Night - Laura Branigan [3:23]\n07 - Magic - Mick Smiley [4:21]\n08 - Main Title Theme (Ghostbusters) - Elmer Bernstein [3:00]\n09 - Dana&amp;#039;s Theme - Elmer Bernstein [3:32]\n10 - Ghostbusters [Instrumental] - Ray Parker, Jr. [4:47]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f8ce4c2d29bd02a54fd0e9a02756ff6f9deba5","amp;dn":"Ghostbusters+-+Soundtrack+%281984%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f8ce4c2d29bd02a54fd0e9a02756ff6f9deba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,248,206,76,45,41,189,2,165,79,208,233,160,39,86,255,111,157,235,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
