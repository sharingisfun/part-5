The Rifftrax audio track has been newly remastered to ensure the riff comments are just loud enough to be clear when the movie is loud and not too loud when the movie is quiet. Please leave any feedback regarding the Rifftrax audio remastering.\n\nThe original Rifftrax was done for the DVD Special Edition which is about 3m27s longer than the Theatrical Edition which was put on Blu-Ray and the video for this is based.\n\nThere are 4 extra scenes from the DVD not on the Blu-Ray:\n      DVD Time Range / Blu-Ray Time\n1) 0h38m54s-0h40m41s / 0h38m54s - Operation Retrieve presentation\n2) 0h43m15s-0h44m36s / 0h41m28s - Torpedo storage discussion on the new Chancellor\n3) 1h42m44s-1h42m47s / 1h39m33s - The assassin's blood being inspected\n4) 1h42m51s-1h43m02s / 1h39m37s - The unmasking of the assassin\n\nThere were also some changes with little or no time changes:\n1. Scott at the conference table with some of the Enterprise's blueprints\n2. A close-up of Kirk for a short moment on the bridge\n3. Visions of the plotters while Spock mind melds\n\nThe riffs from the 4 extra scenes are included after the intro that plays during the credits. This is audio only and is only on audio1: 2.0 Riff. The intro and the audio from the extra DVD scenes cause the total running time to be 24 seconds longer than the video. The screen will just be black for the last 24 seconds.\n\nBig thanks to the posters of the 1080p/5.1 encodes of the movies, the subs and the chapters.\n\nIf these Rifftrax were enjoyable, you haven't paid for them and you have a few dollars to spare, please consider purchasing these riffs (3.99USD) or make a general donation (5USD and up) - they take Bitcoin now too  \n\nPlease check out other Rifftrax, Star Trek Enterprise, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, documentaries and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea093a17a4229a19d14fd64901180b5af1f6e6a6","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+6+The+Undiscovered+Country+1991+1080p+Rifftrax+6ch+2ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea093a17a4229a19d14fd64901180b5af1f6e6a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,9,58,23,164,34,154,25,209,79,214,73,1,24,11,90,241,246,230,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
