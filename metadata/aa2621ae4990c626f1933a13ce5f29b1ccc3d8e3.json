He loves to have adventures while he's traveling for work and, of course, he drives a pick-up truck. While Mike is king of the hill at work, he's the odd man out in a home that is dominated by women -- namely his wife, Vanessa, and their three daughters, 22- year-old Kristin, 17-year-old Mandy and 14-year-old Eve. After being a stay-at-home mom for years, Vanessa recently returned to the workplace and was quickly promoted (much to the dismay of her primarily male co-workers). As a result of Vanessa's increased work load, Mike is pulled into more hands-on parenting than ever before.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa2621ae4990c626f1933a13ce5f29b1ccc3d8e3","amp;dn":"Last.Man.Standing.US.S04E03.HDTV.x264-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa2621ae4990c626f1933a13ce5f29b1ccc3d8e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,38,33,174,73,144,198,38,241,147,58,19,206,95,41,177,204,195,216,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
