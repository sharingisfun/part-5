David Brill's creations display a &quot;lively element&quot; missing in many other works. The biggest reason for this is his extensive use of wet-folding, however, these models can be folded without wet folding. This book is worth buying for a few models in particular. Everyone should make the Ship-in-bottle and the Ring Box, both truly spectacular pieces of art. Brill has also included many animals, some modular, and some holiday/theme related pieces/sets. The biggest drawback for this book is the directions. All of them are handdrawn, and sometimes certain lines, folds, etc. are missing, which can be aggrevating to the beginner. The diagrams in this book are not like the diagrams in Montroll's newer books, but nonetheless, the models are equally (if not more) spectacular.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9785ecaa888140ca70686a366dcefbb7b80c09f1","amp;dn":"Brilliant+Origami%3A+A+Collection+of+Original+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9785ecaa888140ca70686a366dcefbb7b80c09f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,133,236,170,136,129,64,202,112,104,106,54,109,206,251,183,184,12,9,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
