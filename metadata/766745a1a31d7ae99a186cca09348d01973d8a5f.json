TracktionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true single-screen interface has it all. Never get lost or distracted due to perfect left-to-right correlation from input to track to mixerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n               A True Single Screen Interface\n\nTracktionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ease of use begins with its unique, single screen interface. While its possible to hide features if you like, all Tracktion features can be reached and operated from this single page.\n\nNo other professional quality music production software can accurately make this claim.\n\n\n               Intuitive, Left-to-Right Workflow\n\nLike reading a (western) book, just move from left-to-rightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ from input, to wave-form, to mixer and output. Tracktion always keeps perfect correlation between track and mixer so you never get lost while working very quickly.\n\n\n                      Modeless Operation\n\nBuilding on principles originally proposed by poineering Apple Computer engineer, Larry Tesler, Tracktion employs a modeless or mode-free user interface.\n\nThis eliminates the confusion caused by the need to select a particular Ã¢â‚¬Å“toolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for any given operation as in most other DAW programs. Less confusion brings greater speed, fun and creativity.\n\n\n\n                        Windows\n\n  Windows 8\n   Windows 7 Service Pack 1 Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate\n   Intel Core 2 Duo 2 GHz Processor\n   5400 RPM Hard Drive (7200RPM recommended)\n   2 GB RAM (4GB Recommended)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         [Installation]\n\n      Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Unrar\n\n\n      Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Install Tracktion 5 setup x86 or x64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
