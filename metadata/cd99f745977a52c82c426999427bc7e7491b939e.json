Sandoval has previously been responsible for a number of 2-CD reissues and box sets from the legendary British band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most recently the 2013 overhaul of 1971Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Muswell Hillbillies. Lola, The KinksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eighth studio album, has long been one of the most requested titles in this series. It spawned the Top 10 U.S. hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“LolaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and U.K. Top 5 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Apeman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and although the LP didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fare well in the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s native England, it earned Top 40 status in America.\n\n\n\nLola, primarily written by Ray Davies with a couple of key contributions from Dave Davies (Ã¢â‚¬Å“StrangersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“RatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), will be paired in the new edition with 1971Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Percy. The latter was composed entirely by Ray as the soundtrack to director Ralph ThomasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ comedy film starring Hywel Bennett, Denholm Elliott, and bombshells Britt Ekland and Elke Sommer. The KinksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ soundtrack, featuring orchestral arrangements by Stanley Myers, has aged considerably better than the movie itself, which involves a transplant of a rather sensitive male organ. Both Lola and Percy will boast bonus content.\n\n\n\nThe original 13-track Lola album is bolstered by seven previously unreleased bonus tracks including alternate versions of the title track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ApemanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Got to Be FreeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as instrumentals of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ContendersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in demo form and Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Time Tomorrow,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the songs Ã¢â‚¬Å“AnytimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Good Life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (SanctuaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous single-disc reissue included the mono single mix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“LolaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and acoustic demos of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ApemanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Powerman.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ While the Ã¢â‚¬Å“LolaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ 45 mix has been appended to Disc 2 here, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ApemanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“PowermanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ demos appear to be missing.\n\n\n\nDisc 2, kicking off with the 13-track Percy soundtrack album, adds ten bonus tracks, six of which are previously unreleased. Of the previously released material, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find the mono single versions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lola,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“ApemanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“RatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Lola and the mono film mix of PercyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Way Love Used to Be,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ first released in 1998. The six unreleased tracks are a remix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“DreamsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Percy, unique mono versions of LolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Powerman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The MoneygoroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Apeman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and its finale reprise in the Percy mono film mixes. This edition appears to have orphaned the mono film mix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“MomentsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the alternate versions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Way Love Used to BeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the prior CD reissue.\n\n\n\nThe expanded Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround has been remastered by producer Sandoval from the original master tapes\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd99f745977a52c82c426999427bc7e7491b939e","amp;dn":"The+Kinks+-+Lola+Versus+%2B+Moneygoround+%2B+Percy+%282014%29+%5BDeluxe+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd99f745977a52c82c426999427bc7e7491b939e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,153,247,69,151,122,82,200,44,66,105,153,66,123,199,231,73,27,147,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
