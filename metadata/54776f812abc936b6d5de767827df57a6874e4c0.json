He started off with a session aimed at the 45 jukebox market and, although he eventually made a few full-length albums for the label, Quebec cut four 45 dates over a two-and-a-half-year period. This double-disc set has all of the jukebox sessions. Most of the 26 selections clock in between four and seven minutes and have long melody statements in addition to concise and soulful solos. Quebec, who was in consistently prime form during his last period, is joined by groups featuring either Skeeter Best or Willie Jones on guitar and Edwin Swanston, Sir Charles Thompson, or Earl Van Dyke on organ. Fun, loose and highly enjoyable music.\n\nIke Quebec was one of the great tenor saxophonists to emerge from the swing era with a sound and drive that came straight from the early giants of the horn, Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster. Like Webster, he had a multi-hued sound, with a thousand gradations from honk to gruff aside to breathy sweetness. A featured soloist with Cab Calloway before slipping into obscurity, Quebec renewed an association with Blue Note in 1959, recording extensively with the label until his death in 1963. His singles are elemental music, much like those of Gene Ammons, and they show Quebec in all his glory, bouncing and wailing on jump tunes like &quot;Zonky,&quot; &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; and &quot;Me 'n' Mabe.&quot; But his finest moments came on soulful ballads and slow blues, songs like &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and &quot;Everything Happens to Me,&quot; when he could embrace a melody with all the dimensions of his sound.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD 1\n01.
