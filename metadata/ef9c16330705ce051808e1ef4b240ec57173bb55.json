Starving and exhausted, he has begun to question how much of what he sees is even real.&quot;\n\n Lone Survivor is the story of a small nameless man in a medical mask, intent on escaping a disease-ridden city, while making sure he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t starve or fall prey to horrific monsters.\n\nThe game manages to be haunting and personal, while featuring only simple sprites. The graphics actually resemble a zoomed-in view of cross-stitch. Gameplay is fairly open for a side-scroller; players can silently avoid confrontation by ducking into the shadows, or they can blast their way through monsters. Rest can be avoided by taking drugs to keep going, but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect that to come without consequences. Finding survivors may be priority, or players can decide to go on alone. No matter what path players take, they will have to look after their psychological health, lest their minds descend into madness.\n\nPLEASE SEED, I HAVE A CRAPPY UPLOAD :)\n\nIF YOU LIKED THE GAME, BUY IT!
