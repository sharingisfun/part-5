The central character is Ignatius J. (Jacques) Reilly, an intelligent but slothful man still living with his mother at age 30 in the city&amp;#039;s Uptown neighborhood, who, because of family circumstances, must set out to get a job. In his quest for employment he has various adventures with colorful French Quarter characters.\n\nA comic masterpiece that memorably evokes the city of New Orleans and whose robust protagonist is a modern-day Falstaff, Don Quixote, or Gargantua. Readers who do not feel charmed or amused by a fat, flatulent, gluttonous, loud, lying, hypocritical, self-deceiving, self-centered blowhard who masturbates to memories of a dog and pretends to profundity when he is only full of beans are not likely to survive the first chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86c38acb628bb5788e964d00e339ec152942ca17","amp;dn":"Toole-A_Confederacy_of_Dunces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86c38acb628bb5788e964d00e339ec152942ca17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,195,138,203,98,139,181,120,142,150,77,0,227,57,236,21,41,66,202,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
