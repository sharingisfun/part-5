MP3 tags required much surgery as this appears to be an older FLAC rip from a unknown pirate(s) (thanks to that pirate/file sharer).\n\nAdditionally, tags were edited so you will see two albums with 4 CD's within each album when viewed in the player. Such things Big Papi does for you.\n\nYou can do me a favor! Load this into your player then go to Vol II Disc 3 Track 12. It is my song to you. Stevie getting his auto-tune on!! Bless all of you pirates and thanks for your generous seeding.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVA - Hitsville USA Vol I - The Motown Singles 1959-1971\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Hitsville USA Vol I - The Motown Singles 1959-1971\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1992\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Standard, (avg. bitrate: 202kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
