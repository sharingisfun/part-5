This two-hour special weaves together the epic story of Sun Tzu himself, and relives a war in which his tactics posthumously saved a city from defeat a victory at war that paved the way toward the unification of China. \n\n\nArt of War is an emotional, epic and ultimately visual understanding of Sun Tzu s lessons, telling the story of other great battles in history, from Rome to the Civil War, WWII, and present day, that help to illustrate that on the battlefields of war, people who understand strategy are the most dangerous weapons of all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: James Lurie\n========================\n\n\nDirected by: David Padrusch\n===========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Art Of War\nYear.................:    2009\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:30:38\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2121 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    1.34 GB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:     August 25, 2009\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433823/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433823/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot; All warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable of attacking, feign incapacity; when active in moving troops, feign inactivity. When near the enemy, make it seem that you are far away; when far away, make it seem that you are near. &quot;\n\n- Sun Tzu\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0517dfc0d5760cea97e55646aaaf706136a7c21b","amp;dn":"Art+Of+War-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0517dfc0d5760cea97e55646aaaf706136a7c21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,23,223,192,213,118,12,234,151,229,86,70,170,175,112,97,54,167,194,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
