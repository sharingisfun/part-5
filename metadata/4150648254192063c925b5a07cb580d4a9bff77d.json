Merged with Acrobat Pro. \n\nTaken from Publishers Weekly:\nBritish journalist Hornby has fashioned a disarming, rueful and sometimes quite funny first novel that is not quite as hip as it wishes to be. The book dramatizes the romantic struggle of Rob Fleming, owner of a vintage record store in London. After his girlfriend, Laura, leaves him for another man, he realizes that he pines not for sexual ecstasy (epitomized by a &quot;bonkus mirabilis&quot; in his past) but for the monogamy this cynic has come to think of as a crime. He takes comfort in the company of the clerks at the store, whose bantering compilations of top-five lists (e.g., top five Elvis Costello songs; top-five films) typify the novel's ingratiating saturation in pop culture. [...] Hornby has earned his own place on the London bestseller lists, and this on-the-edge tale of musical addiction just may climb the charts here. First serial to Esquire.\n\n\n                \n===============================================================\n\n\nMore NFO here: \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;pid=164148#pid164148&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;pid=164148#pid164148&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(Scroll down a bit)\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\nReport bad torrents here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy uploads: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4150648254192063c925b5a07cb580d4a9bff77d","amp;dn":"Nick+Hornby%3A+High+Fidelity+%281995%29+%5BBookmarks+%2B+cover%5D+%5Bpdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4150648254192063c925b5a07cb580d4a9bff77d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,80,100,130,84,25,32,99,201,37,181,160,124,181,128,212,169,191,247,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
