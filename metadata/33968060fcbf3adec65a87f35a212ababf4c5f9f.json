Starting from one second, time scales are enlarged until processes are reached that take much longer than the age of the universe. After the largest possible eternities, the reader is treated to the shortest and fastest phenomena known. Then the authors increase with powers of ten, until again the second is reached at the end of the book.\nAt each time scale, interesting natural phenomena occur, spread over all scientific disciplines: orbital and rotation periods of planets and stars, decay times of elementary particles and atoms, biological rhythms and evolution processes, but also the different geological time scales.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s12.postimg.org/r5r4s7bct/Time_in_Powers_of_Ten_Natural_Phenomena_and_Th.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s12.postimg.org/r5r4s7bct/Time_in_Powers_of_Ten_Natural_Phenomena_and_Th.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33968060fcbf3adec65a87f35a212ababf4c5f9f","amp;dn":"Time+in+Powers+of+Ten+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33968060fcbf3adec65a87f35a212ababf4c5f9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,150,128,96,252,191,58,222,198,90,135,243,90,33,42,186,191,76,95,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
