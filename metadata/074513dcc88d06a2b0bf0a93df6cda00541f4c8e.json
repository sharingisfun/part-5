Ward navigates the change of early 20th century America on the wrong side of the law and society, his loyal friend, a freed slave named Christmas Moultrie, at his side. Master of Shakespeare, and the shotgun that provides Savannah's markets with fowl, Ward fights for his rights as a hunter. His charisma and eloquent rhetoric win the heart of a society woman who defies her father to marry him. An elderly Moultrie tells the story of life on the river with his friend to a little boy, who passes the legendary Ward Allen down to the next generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:074513dcc88d06a2b0bf0a93df6cda00541f4c8e","amp;dn":"Savannah+%282013%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"074513dcc88d06a2b0bf0a93df6cda00541f4c8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,69,19,220,200,141,6,162,176,191,10,147,223,108,218,0,84,31,76,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
