This is pure progressive folk. :)\n\nIf you're lost and dont know where to start... try for instance the 1972 Olympia Concert, or the marvellous 1973 Chemins de Terre album.\nIf you're an experienced progger you may like to plunge directly in the majestic Symphonie Celtique.\nOr maybe, from a more modern &quot;world music&quot; point of view, you can start from the 1998 1 Douar album and listen for instance to Alan Stivell which duets with Youssou N'Dour in a song which could really be the world music manifesto.\n\nThere's so much to hear, to learn and to love in Stivell's discography.\nIt may also happen that you start to play strange instruments...\nthat you start to transcribe harp tunes on the guitar with fingerstyle techniques...\nthat you start singing in breton...\nit may happen to you... To me... it happened :D\n\nThere are 30 albums: 27 from his discography (pretty complete apart some redundant compilation) and 3 with various authors.\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps. (Except for two compilations with various artists) \n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\nAlbum List:\n\n\n1961 - Telenn Geltiek (Harpe Celtique)\n1970 - Reflets\n1971 - Renaissance Of The Celtic Harp\n1972 - Olympia Concert\n1973 - Chemins de Terre\n1974 - E Langonned\n1975 - Live In Dublin\n1976 - Trema'n Inis (Vers l'Ile)\n1977 - Before Landing\n1978 - Un Dewezh' Barzh' Ger - Journee a la Maison\n1979 - Symphonie Celtique (Tir na Nog)\n1979 - Tro Ar Bed _ International Tour\n1981 - Terre des Vivants _ Bed and dud vecu\n1983 - Legende _ Mojenn\n1988 - Harpes du nouvel Age\n1991 - The Mist Of Avalon\n1993 - Again\n1995 - Brian Boru\n1997 - 70-95 Zoom\n1998 - 1 Douar _ 1 Earth\n1998 - A Portrait Of Alan Stivell\n1999 - The Best of Alan Stivell\n2000 - Back to Breizh\n2002 - Au dela des mots _ Beyond Words\n2006 - Explore\n2009 - Emerald\n2012 - Ar Pep Gwellan - Best Of\n\n\nwith various authors\n\n1997 - Le Chant des Pierres - 192\n1999 - Bretagnes a Bercy\n2003 - Nuit Celtique II - VBR\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec48b0963d01ddfa31c9831549d5cbd15ad07019","amp;dn":"celtic+-+Alan+Stivell+discography+1961+-+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec48b0963d01ddfa31c9831549d5cbd15ad07019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,72,176,150,61,1,221,250,49,201,131,21,73,213,203,209,90,208,112,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
