Mind Bokeh -- whose title was inspired by the photography term for the way a lens renders out-of-focus points of light -- is true to its name and Wilkinsons hyperactive creativity, but not in obvious ways. Though the title track dapples sparkling electronics over a luminous haze of distant nature samples, the rest of the album isnt exactly blurry. In fact, its sounds are often surprisingly hard-edged and chilly, especially compared to Ambivalence Avenues summery vibe. Yet Wilkinsons meticulous way of layering these crisp, immediate sounds with half-heard atmospheres is fascinating (especially under headphones), suggesting the intertwining of the present with dreams and memories, and the external world with the internal one.\n\nReleased: March 29, 2011\nGenre: Electronic\nStyle: Post Rock, Indie Electronic\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracks: \n\n 1.
