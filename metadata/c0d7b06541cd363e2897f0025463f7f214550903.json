Of the three members of the crew, two have mysteriously \r\ndisappeared. The third one, barely alive, undergoes an horrible metamorphosis \r\nturning into a monstrous &quot;thing&quot;. When he breaks out and, chased in vain by \r\ninspector Lomax, starts killing humans and animals to feed his transformation, \r\nQuatermass realizes that this is the way chosen by an alien form of life to \r\ninvade the Earth.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Brian Donlevy.\r\n=&gt;-Margia Dean.\r\n=&gt;-Jack Warner.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Val Guest.\r\n\r\nQuatermass 2 1957.\r\nDr. Quatermass is the director of an important scientific base, where he \r\nbuilds nuclear rockets for the colonization of the Moon. A strange fall of \r\nmeteorites in a nearby village leads to the discovery of a huge base under \r\na strict military control, officially a factory of artificial food. The \r\nshrewdness of Quatermass reveals that the factory is the place chosen by \r\nthe aliens to conquer the Earth: they come in the form of an alive gas \r\nhidden in the meteors and to live in our atmosphere they use the human \r\nbody taking the control of the brain. The courage of Quatermass and the \r\nlaunch of of his nuclear rocket against the asteroid of the aliens save \r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Brian Donlevy.\r\n=&gt;-Sidney James.\r\n=&gt;-John Longden.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Val Guest.\r\n\r\nQuatermass and the Pit 1967.\r\nWhile digging an extension in the London underground, workers come across \r\nskeletal remains. Construction is halted and palaeontologist Dr. Matthew \r\nRoney's team take over. They soon find a metal object that they initially \r\nthink might be a bomb but turns out to be an alien spacecraft of some kind. \r\nRoney's assistant Barbara Judd and Professor Bernard Quatermass, a rocket \r\nspecialist who does experimental work for the Ministry of Defence, \r\ndiscover that much of the housing around the site was abandoned by its \r\ninhabitants 40 years ago because of strange noises and what was believed \r\nto be ghosts. Inside the spacecraft they find the remnants of insect-like \r\ncreatures, all now dead. In disturbing the craft however, they release an \r\ninvisible force of immense power.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-James Donald.\r\n=&gt;-Barbara Shelley.\r\n=&gt;-Andrew Keir.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Roy Ward Baker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0d7b06541cd363e2897f0025463f7f214550903","amp;dn":"The+Quatermass+Collection+1%2C+2%2C+3+-+Horror+Sci-Fi+1955-1967+Eng+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0d7b06541cd363e2897f0025463f7f214550903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,215,176,101,65,205,54,62,40,151,240,2,84,99,247,242,20,85,9,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
