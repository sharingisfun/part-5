Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's Odyssey are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominent among these the stream of consciousness technique he perfected. Other major works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His complete oeuvre also includes three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism, and his published letters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f446d25b18743b6c13621a3c56eaf40e6d1139c8","amp;dn":"James+Joyce+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f446d25b18743b6c13621a3c56eaf40e6d1139c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,70,210,91,24,116,59,108,19,98,26,60,86,234,244,14,109,17,57,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
