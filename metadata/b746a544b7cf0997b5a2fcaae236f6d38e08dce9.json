Raja, Amit Prakash Srivastava, Manish Dwivedi, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPower Plant EngineeringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nNew Age International | 2006 | ISBN: 8122418317, 8122423337 | 491 pages | PDF\n\nThere have been significant developments and advances in the field of power plant engineering,\ncomputer applications on energy audit and management, environmental audit and management, human\ndevelopment and environment. The authors have been encouraged to write this pioneer book for the\nbenefit of students of engineering and researchers due to their contribution in power generation covering\nthe syllabi of conventional power plants i.e., Power Plant Engineering, at the international level in\ngeneral as text cum reference book.\n\nThis book being pilot project of the authors specially in the area of conventional power plant will\nsatisfy the engineering scholars as well as researchers in the field of direct energy conversion devices.\nIn the present book the syllabi enclosed has been covered in the most lucid manner from\npower plant point of view to avoid the unnecessary bulkiness and to reduce the cost of the price for\nthe benefit of our beloved students of engineering in particular and others in general.\n\nWe have written this pioneering book on the basis of syllabi in the most lucid and compact\nmanner for the benefit of the students and the readers.\nThe authors are greatly indebted to Ch. Sunil Singh, Chairman, SITM Lucknow, Mr. K.C. Mishra\nSuptt. Engineer, Saudia Electric Co. Saudi Arabia, for their great encouragement in writing this book.\nWithout their support and help we would not have been able to accomplish this tough and challenging\nwork.\nIn the end the authors will feel obliged for critical and useful suggestions since this pioneer book\ncovers the syllabi in the most useful area of Mechanical Engineering in particular and is applicable for\nall branches of technology and engg. for all major Indian Universities, as well as at international level.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b746a544b7cf0997b5a2fcaae236f6d38e08dce9","amp;dn":"Power+Plant+Engineering+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b746a544b7cf0997b5a2fcaae236f6d38e08dce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,70,165,68,183,207,9,151,181,162,252,170,226,54,246,211,142,8,220,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
