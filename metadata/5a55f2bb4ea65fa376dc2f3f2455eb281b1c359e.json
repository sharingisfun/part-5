They planned to be at her party for 20 minutes and then head off to the hotel to get some rest before the Webcon the next day. When they get to Nora's house, nobody is there. Carly suggested that they did an improptu iCarly webisode to get more people to come to Nora's party. Many people show up and Nora is elated. At the end of the party, Nora locks the trio in her father's soundsystem downstairs, because she believes that they are three angels sent to her to help her become popular. Sam managed to pick the lock with a sharpened duck bone, but Nora (while wearing a Richard Nixon mask) scared them back inside. They then devise a coded SOS message and sent it to Gibby. Then he, along with his little brother Guppy, who's doing home repairs for Spencer in exchange for setting up a camp in the loft left to rescue them. They put up a fight, but it was Guppy who grabbed the keys and opened the door while Nora was fighting Gibby.\n\nSource...............: HDTV from ARCH\nFile Size............: 376 MB\nDIsplay Aspect Ratio.: 16:9\n\nVideo................: Avi File\n......................
