Written and directed with great skill and energy by writer/director brothers Luc &amp; Jean-Pierre Dardenne, the film stars newcomer Emelie Dequenne, who won the best actress award for her outstanding realisation of the title role. Every day, Rosetta fights for a job that she finds, that she loses, that she finds again, that is taken away from her, that she takes back, obsessed by the fear of disappearing, by the shame of not belonging. She wants a normal life, with them, amongst them.
