Extract the data with 7zip. WinRAR can't extract the data.\n\n\n2.) Copy the data to the root of your SDcard (sdcard/SF_IV_DATA).\nif you copy it elsewhere it will tell you that the files are corrupted so make sure you copy them to the sdcard/\n\n(not sure if some phones use other location)\n\nfor example in my galaxy sii the location is: Go to applications then open the folder 'my files' and just copy the folder SF_IV_DATA there and on the top of the screen you can see the location is shown:  /sdcard\n\n\n3.) Now copy the Street Fighter IV v1.00.02.apk anywhere you want to your phone and Install the APK.\n\n\n4.) Run the game Seed and Enjoy!:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1baf4ea1faefed74bf8fce88fb26d973d6482a7e","amp;dn":"Street+Fighter+IV+v1.00.02+Android+%2B+SD+Data","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1baf4ea1faefed74bf8fce88fb26d973d6482a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,175,78,161,250,239,237,116,191,143,206,136,251,38,217,115,214,72,42,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
