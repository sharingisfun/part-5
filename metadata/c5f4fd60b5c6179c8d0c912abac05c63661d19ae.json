The single released on Feb. 14, and Toronto\\'s 102.1 The Edge was the first to add the track. Three days later, \\&quot;N/A OK,\\&quot; made it onto The Edge\\'s Thursday 30, and the track continues to climb their charts. Stations across Canada are eager to jump on the trail, like Live 105, in Halifax, The Zone, @ 91-3 in Victoria and Sonic, 102.9 in Edmonton, and Live 885, in Ottawa to name a few.....\n\n.. ..\n\nStatistically, we\\'re smiling. \\&quot;N/A OK\\&quot; is climbing at a rate faster than previous singles, like \\&quot;Hollowpoint,\\&quot; with 4962 spins, \\&quot;Anti-Venom,\\&quot; with 3393 spins, and \\&quot;Laces Out,\\&quot; with 5760 spins.....\n\n....\n\n\\&quot;N/A OK\\&quot; is the #2 most added on Mediabase Alternative Rock Chart, the single went from #84 to #27 (in a month) on the Mediabase Alternative Rock (Published Panel) SPINS Chart, and is the #3 greatest gainer.....\n\n.. ..\n\nThe EP \\&quot;USS Approved\\&quot; will be released May 3rd, 2011, available digitally worldwide. The hard copy of the EP will be available exclusively in Canada.....\n\n.. ..\n\nUSS debuted the new music to a sold-out crowd on March 10, at Toronto\\'s Phoenix Concert Theatre, for Canadian Music Fest 2011.
