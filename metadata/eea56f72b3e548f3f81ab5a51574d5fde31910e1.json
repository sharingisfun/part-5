This offbeat adaptation gives the viewer a postmodern taste of Shakespeare through the eyes of a deliberately obscure auteur. The film is set some time after Chernobyl has wiped everything out, and the world is trying to set itself right again. William Shakespeare Jr. the Fifth (Peter Sellars) is faced with the task of restoring his famed ancestor&amp;#039;s lost works. He visits a resort in Switzerland and becomes fascinated with a visiting gangster, Don Learo (Burgess Meredith) and his lovely daughter, Cordelia (Molly Ringwald), who converse in actual Shakespearean lines. That&amp;#039;s as close to the bard as this King Lear gets. It also includes appearances by Woody Allen, Norman Mailer, and director Godard himself as &quot;The Professor,&quot; a deranged individual who seems fascinated with Xeroxing his own hand.\n-AMG\n\nRipper&amp;#039;s note: This is my fresh rip from the Xenon Video NTSC VHS. The source tape i used was NOT in a pristine condition, the image seems to be on the darker side of the spectrum, so you better experiment with your player&amp;#039;s Contrast/Brightness.\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
