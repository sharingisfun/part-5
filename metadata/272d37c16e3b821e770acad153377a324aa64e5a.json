To Bush, a professional is someone that has no expectation of human \nsanity in the giving of right human emotion and care rather than just an idea that \nto kowtow and show up on time and do whatever you're told to - and never be warm \nin a genuine sense - that this is all somehow superior integrity - as that is all \nhe knows. How sad. That's why they don't mix up the barrel down there too much - \nthey cant stand the heat in the kitchen when folks start yellin &quot;stupid&quot; at how it \nis they see the Irish spirit subjected to the ideas of the inane.\n\nI wonder they're still selling flowers down there - except for funerals \nI should think!\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:272d37c16e3b821e770acad153377a324aa64e5a","amp;dn":"The+Fabulous+Baker+Boys+%281989%29+DivX+%28moviesbyrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"272d37c16e3b821e770acad153377a324aa64e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,45,55,193,110,59,130,30,119,10,202,209,83,55,122,50,74,166,78,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
