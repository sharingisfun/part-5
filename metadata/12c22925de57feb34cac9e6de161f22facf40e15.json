The series is co-produced by Chuck Lorre Productions, More-Medavoy Productions and 4 to 6 Foot Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television for ABC. The show's theme song was written and performed by composer Dennis C. Brown.\n\nCreated by executive producers Dottie Dartland and Chuck Lorre, the comedy took much of its inspiration from so-called culture-clash &quot;fish out of water&quot; situations.[1] The show earned eight Golden Globe nominations, six Emmy Award nominations, and six Satellite Awards nominations.[1] Elfman earned a Golden Globe in 1999 for Best Actress.\n\nJenna Elfman as Dharma Freedom Montgomery, nÃƒÂ©e Finkelstein, Greg's wife and a flower child. She is overly cheerful and sensitive, but she is also more compassionate and forgiving than most people. Despite her trust in the goodness of people and persistent good intentions, Dharma is not naive. She understands the real world, employs sarcasm and receives it well. Dharma perseveres in expressing her personality and her identity even in the face of an overwhelmingly opposing world. Dharma encourages Greg to seek happiness rather than fret about practical issues like money. She is named after the concept of dharma in Indian philosophy. A Native American friend of her father's gave her the name &quot;Crazy Man's Daughter&quot;.\n\nAccording to Chuck Lorre's eleventh vanity card (see below), he and Dottie Dartland originally conceived Dharma &amp; Greg as &quot;a series revolving around a woman whose personality is not a neurotic product of societal and parental conditioning, but of her own free-flowing, compassionate mind&quot;.\n\nThomas Gibson as lawyer Gregory Clifford &quot;Greg&quot; Montgomery, Dharma's husband. He is an upright, uptight, decent, though sometimes surprisingly open-minded man. Greg's life was hopelessly banal before he met Dharma and married her on their first date. Since then, he has played straight man to the antics of his eccentric wife. Though his relationship with Dharma has been rocky at times, Greg has never been shown to regret their marriage. He is an alumnus of elite schools, Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard University, and Stanford Law School.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12c22925de57feb34cac9e6de161f22facf40e15","amp;dn":"Dharma+and+Greg+Season+1+DVDRip.x264+MKV+Subtitles+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12c22925de57feb34cac9e6de161f22facf40e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,194,41,37,222,87,254,179,76,172,158,109,225,97,242,47,172,244,14,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
