Within this 113 page, full-colour hardback book, you will find 32 new monsters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nightmarish horrors and noble beasts, creatures of magic made flesh and the victims of terrible curses inflicted by dark powers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ presented in the form of Binding Scrolls for use with any Warhammer army.\n\nThese are not limited to just Storm of Magic games, however, as the book contains nine scenarios and special rules to allow these deadly creatures to be fielded in regular Warhammer battles, and a helpful appendix chart to allow you to theme your monsters to your army.
