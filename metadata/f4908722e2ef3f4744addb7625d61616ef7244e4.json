To combat computerised crime more effectively, the\nCyber Police Unit of the City of Oedo has begun to employ hardened criminals \nwith a history of hi-tech offences and other crimes such as murder. Three such \ncriminals are Sengoku, Gogol and Benten who are serving their 300-or-more year \nsentences in an orbital penitentiary. For duty served, each criminal will\nreceive a reduction in their prison time. Desperate to get away from the \nboredom and monotony of jail life, they half-heartedly agree to the deal.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4908722e2ef3f4744addb7625d61616ef7244e4","amp;dn":"Cyber+City+Oedo+808++h.264+dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4908722e2ef3f4744addb7625d61616ef7244e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,144,135,34,226,239,63,71,68,173,219,118,37,214,22,22,239,114,68,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
