She is unmistakable both in her music (a fusion of surf guitars, blues and rockabilly that wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be out of place in a David Lynch film) and her style, with a solitary curl and shock of blonde in her jet black hair.\n\nHow do you follow up the success of Imelda May s 2011 Mayhem? You follow it with More Mayhem!\n\nMore Mayhem features Imelda May s best songs from her two previous albums, Mayhem and Love Tattoo plus six new songs. The 21-track special edition album expands on her 2011 release Mayhem, which sold more than 400,000 copies worldwide. Bonus material includes three new songs, one being the new single, Roadrunner and tracks Gypsy and Blues Calling. More Mayhem also contains a previously unreleased cover of Patsy Cline s Walking After Midnight and new remixes of Inside Out and Proud and Humble. The Times in the U.K. raved Roadrunner had vocals that flowed from May as fast as her husband s hurricane paced surf guitar rhythms.\n\nMayhem marked Imeldas second album in the U.S. and her first on the Decca label. She wrote 13 of the 14 tracks and the album debuted at #1 on Billboard s New Artist Chart. Imelda appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno four times within a year along with performances on Conan, The Late Show with Craig Ferguson, PBSs WoodSongs and Rachael Ray. She closed out 2011 with 2 sold out shows at Dublins 02 Arena duetting with fellow countryman Bono, and completed her 2012 UK tour at Londons iconic Royal Albert Hall.\nPerforming a fusion of surf guitars, blues and rockabilly, Imeldas accomplished band includes husband Darrel Higham on guitars, Al Gare on double-bass, Dave Priseman on trumpet and Steve Rushton on drums.
