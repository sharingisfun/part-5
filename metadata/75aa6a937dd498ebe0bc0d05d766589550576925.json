For one thing, \nJelly Roll Morton revolutionized the form, more than Charlie Parker did and maybe even Louis Armstrong.\n His early RCA Victor recordings laid much of the music's foundation, particularly the Chicago &quot;Red Hot Peppers&quot;\n recordings, and Morton himself has been hailed as the first great jazz composer in a long tradition of composers\n that include Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, and Wayne Shorter. Simply put, you can't say enough\n about the greatness and the importance of Morton's music.\n\nThis collection by JSP is an absolute godsend. Originally a British import that received poor circulation in the U.S.,\n it went out of print for many years when JSP was bought by another company that went on to re-issue all of their CD's.\n As any jazz collector can tell you, these CD's are famous for the meticulous remastering done by jazz archivist/sound \nexpert, John T. R. Davies, and this Jelly Roll Morton box set is one of THE gems of the JSP catalog.\n It covers pretty much the same recording as the RCA Victor box set, &quot;Centennial,&quot; including every track of Morton's\n best and most famous work with his Red Hot Peppers. JSP's box set is much more preferable than the RCA Victor \nset for many reasons. First, alternate takes are place on separate discs (RCA stacks them on top of the master take),\n which makes for better listening. Second, the JSP box is much less expensive. Third and most important of all is sound\n quality. RCA's box set was released in 1990, and like all it's reissues of that era, it was heavily processed\n with NoNoise, leaving a squeaky clean sound, but with the high and low end frequencies lopped off. Furthermore,\n good sources weren't always secured by RCA, so many tracks on their set were taken from analogue tape copies of old\n source material. The overall result was a muffled, heavily compressed sound that squeezed the life out of the music. \nIt was all the more depressing considering that the music was recorded extraordinarily well for their time.\n With this JSP box set, Davies secured superior sources, including some rare 78 rpm records from private collections.\n Furthermore, noise reduction was very minimal, which means there's more surface noise on these CD's, but the liveliness\n of the sound is simply amazing. Simply put, there's absolutely no reason to buy &quot;The Centennial&quot; box set when you have\n this beauty available.\n\nMuch of this music is essential to any jazz collection, and this box set from JSP is absolutely the best way to attain\n it. Great music, amazing sound quality, and a great bargain.\n\n==================================================\n\nTracklist\n\nCD1                                                \n\n01 - Black Bottom Stomp.flac\n02 - Smoke-House Blues.flac\n03 - The Chant.flac\n04 - Sidewalk Blues.flac\n05 - Dead Man Blues.flac\n06 - Steamboat Stomp.flac\n07 - Someday Sweetheart.flac\n08 - Grandpa's Spells.flac\n09 - Original Jelly Roll Blues.flac\n10 - Doctor Jazz.flac\n11 - Cannon Ball Blues.flac\n12 - Hyena Stomp.flac\n13 - Billy Goat Stomp.flac\n14 - Wild Man Blues.flac\n15 - Jungle Blues.flac\n16 - Beale Street Blues.flac\n17 - The Pearls.flac\n18 - Wolverine Blues.flac\n19 - Mr. Jelly Lord.flac\n\nCD2\n\n01 - Red Hot Pepper.flac\n02 - Deep Creek.flac\n03 - Pop.flac\n04 - Seattle Hunch.flac\n05 - Frances (Fat Frances).flac\n06 - Freakish.flac\n07 - Burnin' the Iceberg.flac\n08 - Courthouse Bump.flac\n09 - Pretty Lil.flac\n10 - Sweet Aneta Mine.flac\n11 - New Orleans Bump (Monrovia).flac\n12 - Down My Way.flac\n13 - Try Me Out.flac\n14 - Tank Town Bump.flac\n15 - Sweet Peter.flac\n16 - Jersey Joe.flac\n17 - Mississippi Mildred.flac\n18 - Mint Julep.flac\n19 - Smilin' the Blues Away.flac\n20 - Turtle Twist.flac\n21 - My Little Dixie Home.flac\n22 - That's Like It Ought to Be.flac\n\nCD3\n\n01 - Each Day.flac\n02 - If Someone Would Only Love Me.flac\n03 - That'll Never Do.flac\n04 - I'm Looking for a Little Bluebird.flac\n05 - Little Lawrence.flac\n06 - Harmony Blues.flac\n07 - Fussy Mabel.flac\n08 - Ponchatrain.flac\n09 - Oil Well.flac\n10 - Load of Coal (Load of Cole).flac\n11 - Crazy Chords.flac\n12 - Primrose Stomp.flac\n13 - Low Gravy.flac\n14 - Strokin' Away.flac\n15 - Blue Blood Blues.flac\n16 - Mushmouth Shuffle.flac\n17 - Gambling Jack.flac\n18 - Fickle Fay Creep.flac\n\nCD4\n\n01 - The Chant.flac\n02 - Sidewalk Blues.flac\n03 - Dead Man Blues.flac\n04 - Someday Sweetheart.flac\n05 - Grandpa's Spells.flac\n06 - Original Jelly-Roll Blues.flac\n07 - Cannon Ball Blues.flac\n08 - Hyena Stomp.flac\n09 - Billy Goat Stomp.flac\n10 - Wild Man Blues.flac\n11 - Jungle Blues.flac\n12 - Beale Street Blues.flac\n13 - The Pearls.flac\n14 - Wolverine Blues.flac\n15 - Georgia Stomp.flac\n16 - Kansas City Stomps.flac\n17 - Shoe Shiner's Drag.flac\n18 - Boogaboo.flac\n19 - Shreveport.flac\n20 - Mournful Serenade.flac\n\n\nCD5\n\n01 - Shreveport (take 2).flac\n02 - Seattle Hunch (take 2).flac\n03 - Freakish.flac\n04 - Burnin' the Iceberg.flac\n05 - Courthouse Bump.flac\n06 - Pretty Lil.flac\n07 - Sweet Anita Mine (take 2).flac\n08 - New Orleans Bump (Monrovia) (take 2).flac\n09 - Tank Town Bump.flac\n10 - Sweet Peter (take 2).flac\n11 - Jersey Joe (take 2).flac\n12 - Mississippi Mildred (take 2).flac\n13 - Each Day (take 2).flac\n14 - Oil Well (take 2).flac\n15 - Load of Coal (Load of Cole) (take 2).flac\n16 - Crazy Chords.flac\n17 - Primrose Stomp (take 2).flac\n18 - Strokin' Away.flac\n19 - Blue Blood Blues (take 2).flac\n20 - Gambling Jack (take 2).flac\n\n==============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 966 MB\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 614 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Complete Recorded Sides 1926-1930, Discs 5/5\nPerformer                                : Jelly Roll Morton\nGenre                                    : Jazz\nRecorded date                            : 2000\n\n==============================================\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 513 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nWriting library                          : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75aa6a937dd498ebe0bc0d05d766589550576925","amp;dn":"Jelly+Roll+Morton+-+Complete+Recorded+Sides+1926-1930+%5B5CD%5D+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75aa6a937dd498ebe0bc0d05d766589550576925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,170,106,147,125,212,152,235,224,188,13,5,215,102,88,149,80,87,105,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
