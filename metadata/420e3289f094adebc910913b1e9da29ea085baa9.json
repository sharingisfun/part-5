This densely detailed expose names every CIA officer, every agent, every operation that Agee encountered during 12 years with &quot;The Company&quot; in Ecuador, Uruguay, Mexico and Washington.\nAmong CIA agents or [contacts] Agee lists high ranking political leaders of several Latin American countries, U.S. and Latin American labor leaders, ranking Community Party members, and scores of other politicians, high military and police officials and journalists.\nAfter a stint as an Air Force officer (for cover) and CIA training, Agee arrived in Quito, Ecuador in late 1960. During the glory years of the Alliance for Progress and the New Frontier, he fought the holy war against communism by bribing politicians and journalists, forging documents, tapping telephones, and reading other people's mail.\nBut it was a faraway event which seems to have disturbed him more. Lyndon Johnson's invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965 was an overreaction Agee couldn't accept. In 1968, he resigned with the conviction that he had become a &quot;servant of the capitalism I rejected&quot; as a university student Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;one of its secret policemen.&quot;\nAgee decided to write this reconstructed diary to tell everything he knew. He spent four years writing the book in Europe, making research trips and dodging the CIA. At one point he lived on money advanced by a woman he believes was working for the CIA and trying to gain his confidence.\nUntil recently, former CIA Director Richard Helm's plea that &quot;You've just got to trust us. We are honorable men&quot; was enough. With the revelations of domestic spying, it no longer is.\nIn this book Agee has provided the most complete description yet of what the CIA does abroad. In entry after numbing entry, U.S. foreign policy in Latin America is pictured as a web of deceit, hypocrisy and corruption. Now that we can no longer plead ignorance of the webs our spiders spin, will be continue to tolerate CIA activities abroad?\nReview Patrick Breslin - The Washington Post","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:420e3289f094adebc910913b1e9da29ea085baa9","amp;dn":"Inside+the+Company+-+CIA+Diary+%28Philip+Agee%29+epub%2C+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"420e3289f094adebc910913b1e9da29ea085baa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,14,50,137,240,148,173,235,201,16,145,59,30,157,162,158,160,133,186,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
