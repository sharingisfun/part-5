In chapters ranging from International Politics to the Animal World, 'Scotland's Jesus' is allowed the opportunity to showcase his increasingly unsympathetic worldview and disintegrating psyche.\n\nA torrent of jokes about recent events provide the framework for a broader philosophical despair. Frankie Boyle uses the stories of the popular press as a springboard to explain the nature of reality and the details of our enslavement to mirthless corporate Warlocks.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Memoir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f18c4f476dda2667ffcfcda315de9b9c8cb3fe1","amp;dn":"Scotland%27s+Jesus+by+Frankie+Boyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f18c4f476dda2667ffcfcda315de9b9c8cb3fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,24,196,244,118,221,162,102,127,252,252,218,49,93,233,185,200,203,63,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
