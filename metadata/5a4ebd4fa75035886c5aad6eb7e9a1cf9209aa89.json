It's a full featured analog modeled synthesizer with a sampler engine as sound source, including a powerful modulation matrix and a high quality self-oscillating 24/12/6 dB low pass filter.\r\n\r\nDon't expect a 40GB piano sample library with samples for every velocity or something similar. The idea is to bring back the fun sampling was in the good old times with small samples, fast loading times and an intuitive work-flow to create your own sample presets without getting lost in the settings.\r\n\r\nTAL-BassLine-101 is a monophonic bass synthesizer and a very accurate emulation of the popular SH 101. The GUI is intuitive and easy to use. It produces the raw sound you know from analogue devices without any effects.\r\nIts 24dB zero feedback delay low pass filter has a very smooth and authentic sound without any digital artifacts, especially designed and calibrated for extreme settings. It sounds even smooth with a lot resonance and a high oscillator pitch where most emulations fail.\r\n\r\nTAL-U-NO-LX is a complete rewritten emulation of the popular Juno 60 with a new engine and GUI. Up to date zero feedback delay filters and carefully calibrated controls make this synth a good replacement for the analog device with all the advantages software plugins have. As an addition, the TAL-U-NO-LX also supports portamento and different filter LFO waveforms and some more useful features. An arpeggiator with different sync modes and hold function is also included. A very fast envelope with a smooth roll-off, emulated inaccuracy and a very smooth filter sound gives this synth the typical sound.\r\n\r\nTAL-NoiseMaker (AU 64bit only) is an improved version of TAL-Elek7ro and has a completely new synth engine and a lot of improvements in sound and usability. The synth also includes a small effect section with a reverb, chorus and a simple bit crusher effect.\r\nA display shows the knob and slider values. This allows more control over the synth. A ringmodulator and a syncable triangle are also part of this synth. TAL-NoiseMaker includes new filter types as the self resonating 6dB low pass and a notch filter. Its improved amplitude ADSR is very suitable for slow pads as for really fast envelopes.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nExtra Banks:\r\n\r\nTAL-U-NO-LX:\r\n\r\nFMR.\r\nOrion.\r\nSymbiotic Sounds.\r\nTronsonic.\r\nTwolegs Toneworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTal-BassLine-101:\r\n\r\nIngo Weidner.\r\nJoel Bilsson.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAL-Sampler:\r\n\r\nClassic 80s (238.2 MB)\r\nEmty Vessel (134.7 MB)\r\nHollowsun (1.27 GB):\r\n\r\n50s Sci-Fi.\r\nAce Tone.\r\nAkai.\r\nAlesis.\r\nARP.\r\nBoss\r\nC64 Drums.\r\nCasio.\r\nChapman Stick.\r\nClavia Nord Modular.\r\nCrumar Performer.\r\nCymbals.\r\nE-Mu.\r\nElka Synthex.\r\nEminent 310.\r\nEnsoniq SQ80.\r\nFairlight.\r\nFarfisa.\r\nFender Rhodes.\r\nFricke.\r\nHammond.\r\nHohner.\r\nJen Bass Pedal.\r\nKawai.\r\nKorg.\r\nLinn.\r\nMattel Synsonic.\r\nMellotron and Chamberlin.\r\nModulus Monowave.\r\nMoog.\r\nMXR185 Drum Computer.\r\nNovation.\r\nOberheim DMX.\r\nPearl.\r\nPPG Wave.\r\nRMI Electrapiano.\r\nRoland.\r\nSakata DPM48.\r\nSequential Circuits.\r\nSimmons.\r\nSound Master SR88.\r\nSoundtech Rhythm 12.\r\nStylophone.\r\nTheremin.\r\nVako Orchestron.\r\nWurlitzer.\r\nYamaha.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nKeygen APP OS X 2016.0 [dada]\r\n\r\n.app to execute Keygen.exe\r\n\r\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:EDF3B6EC97D1D02B96F9441A3BD2F80140E19088\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\r\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\r\n\r\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\r\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\r\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\r\n\r\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfuture-dada\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndemonoid.pw\r\n1337x.to\r\nthepiratebay.se\r\nflashtorrents.org\r\nbtscene.cc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMMXV (12)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a4ebd4fa75035886c5aad6eb7e9a1cf9209aa89","amp;dn":"TAL+Software+Plugins+Pack+12.2015+%2B+Extra+Banks+OS+X+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a4ebd4fa75035886c5aad6eb7e9a1cf9209aa89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,78,189,79,167,80,53,136,108,90,173,110,183,233,161,207,146,9,170,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
