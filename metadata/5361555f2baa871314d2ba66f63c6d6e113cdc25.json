Rachmaninoff is widely considered one of the finest pianists of his day and, as a composer, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian classical music. Early influences of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers gave way to a thoroughly personal idiom that included a pronounced lyricism, expressive breadth, structural ingenuity, and a tonal palette of rich, distinctive\norchestral colors. The piano is featured prominently in Rachmaninoff's compositional output. He made a point of using his own skills as a performer to explore fully the expressive possibilities of the instrument. Even in his earliest works he revealed a sure grasp of idiomatic piano writing and a striking gift for melody.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlexander Nikolayevich Scriabin, (6 January 1872 [O.S. 25 December 1871]  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 27 April [O.S. 14 April] 1915) was a Russian composer and pianist who initially developed a lyrical and idiosyncratic tonal system inspired by the music of FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ric Chopin. Quite independent of the innovations of Arnold Schoenberg, Scriabin developed, as a sort of mysticism, an increasingly atonal musical system that presaged twelve-tone composition and other serial music. He may be considered to be the main Russian Symbolist composer. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriabin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriabin&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLang Lang - Yuri Temirkanov, St.Petersburg Philharmonic - Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No.3,\nScriabin Etudes [Telarc, Proms 2001 Live]\n\nTracks 1-3 Lang Lang - Yuri Temirkanov, St.Petersburg Philharmonic\nTracks 4-14 Lang Lang\nTracks 1-4 recorded live at Royal Albert Hall, August 22, 2001\n\n01  Rachmaninov: Piano Concerto No.3 in D minor, op.30 - 1.
