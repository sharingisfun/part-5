Use the Keygen or the Reg.reg file...\n\nIt's an old version, but jersson was asking for that, and this one is the only working version found around...\n\n\nThanks to electronic mail, mass communication made a quantum leap towards becoming a truly effective marketing mechanism. As we immerse into the new digital era of limitless communication, we use various tools for organizing our mass message delivery activities.\n\nSuccessful e-business managers knows that the customer database and mailing list maintenance task is one of the toughest, yet the most rewarding one. Besides acquiring and storing a database with subscribers' e-mail addresses, there is another important task - periodical email address verification. People tend to use several e-mail addresses at once as well to abandon addresses overfilled with spam. And everyone loves getting new addresses too!\n\nNow that we know this happens, it is wise to check the mailing list for the so-called 'dead' addresses every now and then, i.e. to &quot;clean&quot; the mailing list. However, since most email address verification programs take so long to process an average database, many managers omit this important stage. As a result, we get unrealistic expectations, which, in its turn, means direct profit loss. So, are we stuck here? No, not really! Introducing Atomic Mail Verifier, unique mailing list entry verification software, intended for lightning-fast automatic verification of e-mail databases of all sizes!\n\nAtomic Mail Verifier (AMV) utilizes all three available e-mail address verification techniques allowing you to choose between the fastest check time and the highest quality of processing (&quot;deep&quot; mailing list cleanup). Among those techniques are e-mail address syntax checks, mail domain existence and response checks, and, finally, complete SMTP mailbox checks.\n\n\nMore infos at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amailsender.com/amv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amailsender.com/amv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista/W7 machine. It's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72bf859a2e609c18525b41431e16696dddeff6e8","amp;dn":"Atomic+Mail+Verifier+v3.1+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72bf859a2e609c18525b41431e16696dddeff6e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,191,133,154,46,96,156,24,82,91,65,67,30,22,105,109,221,239,246,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
