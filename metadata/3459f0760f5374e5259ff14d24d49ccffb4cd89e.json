Otherwise, this volume is\n   just as charming and gorgeous as all the other, less controversial, ones, though.\n\nScanscription notes:\n\n   The timeline of this release meanders thusly:\n\n      1930-31: Original serialized publication\n      1931:    Original single-volume edition\n      1946:    Original colour edition\n      1975:    Revised colour edition\n      1991:    English translation of the 1931 edition\n      1997:    German translation of the 1975 edition\n      2008:    German translation of the 1946 edition\n    ( 2014:    gesserit combines scans of the 1991 and 2008 editions into this! ) \n\n   The differences between the 1946 and 1975 editions are confined to a single page,\n   both versions of which are included here. About 2% of the text is original\n   re-translation, as there was no direct correspondence between the to-be-filled\n   speech bubble and any of the ones in the English scan. About 10% is slightly\n   edited, as one to-be-filled bubble corresponded to several in the English scan,\n   or vice versa. The remainder could be directly transferred, subject to the\n   occasional need to redo the word wrapping because of changes in bubble shape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3459f0760f5374e5259ff14d24d49ccffb4cd89e","amp;dn":"Tintin+in+the+Congo+%281946+Color+Edition%7CHR-1920%29+%28NW%29-%28gesserit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3459f0760f5374e5259ff14d24d49ccffb4cd89e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,89,240,118,15,83,116,229,37,159,241,77,36,212,156,207,251,76,216,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
