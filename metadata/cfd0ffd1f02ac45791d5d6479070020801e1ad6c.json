Not so this time. On Time Well Wasted, Paisley&amp;#039;s voice--never overwhelmed by overmixed instruments (a problem dogging many current vocalists)--remains keenly focused. There&amp;#039;s quality material in abundance, heavy on originals and delightfully quirky bonus tracks. The album&amp;#039;s first hit, Paisley&amp;#039;s self-penned &quot;Alcohol,&quot; has the potential to become a lasting anthem in a genre where booze songs long ago became an art form. Guy Clark&amp;#039;s &quot;Out in the Parkin&amp;#039; Lot,&quot; a duet with Alan Jackson, sounds more organic, less contrived than most Music Row pairings. The same applies to &quot;When I Get Where I&amp;#039;m Going,&quot; a spiritual duet with Dolly Parton. As in the past, Paisley&amp;#039;s country-jazz Telecaster prowess (phemonenal on the dazzling instrumental &quot;Time Warp&quot;) remains remarkable, as does his insistence that his sidemen get ample space to shine. Such assets set Paisley apart, as does his ability to make real creativity commercially successful in a Nashville concerned mainly with the latter.\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
