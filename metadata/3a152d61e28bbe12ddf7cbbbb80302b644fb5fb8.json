This is not strictly a translation as it has been assembled from various modern translations in English and other modern European languages without reference to the original Sumerian, Akkadian or Hittite. Despite or because of this it is a remarkably lucid and fluent version possessing a contemporary feel as if it were fantasy or science fiction.\n\nA CD rip of A Recorded Books set from 2004, narrated by George Guidall.It is still one of the most important explorations of what it means to be human.
