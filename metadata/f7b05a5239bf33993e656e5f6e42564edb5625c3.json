Although it wasnÃ¢Â€â„¢t the way he wanted to go, Harry has to admit that being out of the game has its benefits. Until Mickey asks him to help on one of his cases, and suddenly Harry is back where he belongs, right in the centre of a particularly puzzling murder mystery.

And not only does the prosecution seem to have a cast-iron case, but having crossed over to â€˜the dark sideÃ¢Â€â„¢ as his former colleagues would put it, Harry is in danger of betraying the very principles heÃ¢Â€â„¢s lived by his whole career","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7b05a5239bf33993e656e5f6e42564edb5625c3","amp;dn":"The+Crossing+by+Michael+Connelly+%5Bepub%2C+mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7b05a5239bf33993e656e5f6e42564edb5625c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,176,90,82,57,191,51,153,62,101,110,95,110,66,86,78,219,86,37,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
