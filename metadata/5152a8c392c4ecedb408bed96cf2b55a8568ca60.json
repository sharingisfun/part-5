But anyone who played the old Dungeons and Dragons knows that these are the best dungeons ever.  Included in this torrent are:\n\n\n\nThe Tomb of Horrors\n\nReturn to the Tomb of Horrors (includes the module above)\n\nWhite Plume Mountain\n\nExpedition to the Barrier Peaks\n\nLost Caverns of Tsjocanth\n\nand, another one I threw in, perhaps the greatest non-TSR dungeon ever -- Tegel Manor.  Tegel Manor was made by Judges Guild and is extremely difficult to find -- it costs like $90 on Ebay.  This is the retooled edition (it&amp;#039;s missing some of the kooky stuff from the first one) but the thought is still there.  It&amp;#039;s still a classic module.\n\nI have all of the AD&amp;D modules I can scan if anyone wants them.  Plus the original books for first edition.  If there is demand.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5152a8c392c4ecedb408bed96cf2b55a8568ca60","amp;dn":"Dungeons+and+Dragons+1st+ed.+--+Tomb+of+Horrors%2C+Whiteume%2C+Barri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5152a8c392c4ecedb408bed96cf2b55a8568ca60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,82,168,195,146,196,236,237,180,8,190,217,108,242,181,90,133,104,202,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
