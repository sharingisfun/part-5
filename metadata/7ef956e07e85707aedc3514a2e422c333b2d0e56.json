Pirsig&amp;#039;s &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; is a powerful, moving, and penetrating examination of how we live . . . and a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation: an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America&amp;#039;s Northwest, undertaken by a father and his young son. A story of love and fear -- of growth, discovery, and acceptance -- that becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey into life&amp;#039;s fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence . . . and the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.\n\nReviews\nNew York Times\nProfoundly important... full of insights into our most perplexing contemporary dilemmas...
