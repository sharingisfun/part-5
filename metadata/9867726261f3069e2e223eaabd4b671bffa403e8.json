It is based upon David Lynch's 1984 movie Dune, an adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel of the same name.\n\nWhile not necessarily the first real-time strategy (RTS) game (elements of which previously appeared in Stonkers, The Ancient Art of War, Command HQ, and particularly Herzog Zwei), Dune II established the format that would be followed for years to come.[2][3] As such, Dune II was the archetypical &quot;real-time strategy&quot; game. Striking a balance between complexity and innovation, it was a huge success and laid the foundation for the coming Command &amp; Conquer, Warcraft, Age of Empires and StarCraft series, and many other RTS games.\n\nInstructions:\nRun the .bat file. That is all.\n\n\nDOSbox has been fully incorporated into the game. \nTested on: \n\nWindows XP 32bit &amp; 64bit \nWindows 7 32bit &amp; 64bit \n\n\n\n\n\nShouts to all the classic gamers out there. Fuck the new wave.\n\nIf you like the software fucking buy it!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9867726261f3069e2e223eaabd4b671bffa403e8","amp;dn":"Dune.2%5BPC%5D%5BWin7.x86.x64%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9867726261f3069e2e223eaabd4b671bffa403e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,103,114,98,97,243,6,158,46,34,62,170,189,75,103,27,255,164,3,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
