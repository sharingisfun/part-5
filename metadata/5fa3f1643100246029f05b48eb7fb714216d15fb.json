Did he see an old friend and her children drown, or was the yacht abandoned when he came aboard? For reasons he cannot explain, Kurt doesn't trust either version of his recollection.\n\nDetermined to know the truth, he begins to search for answers, and soon finds himself descending into a shadowy world of state-sponsored cybercrime, and uncovering a pattern of vanishing scientists, suspicious accidents, and a web of human trafficking. With the help of Joe Zavala, he takes on the sinister organization at the heart of this web, facing off with them in locations ranging from Monaco to North Korea to the rugged coasts of Madagascar. But where he will ultimately end up, even he could not begin to guess.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa3f1643100246029f05b48eb7fb714216d15fb","amp;dn":"Clive+Cussler%2C+Graham+Brown+%28NUMA-Austin+12%29+Ghost+Ship","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa3f1643100246029f05b48eb7fb714216d15fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,163,241,100,49,0,36,96,41,240,91,72,235,127,183,20,33,109,21,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
