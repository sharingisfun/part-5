He wrote vast volumes about animals. He described them, classified them, told us where and how they live and how they develop in the womb or in the egg. He founded a science. It can even be said\nthat he founded science itself.\n\nIn The Lagoon, acclaimed biologist Armand Marie Leroi recovers AristotleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s science. He revisits AristotleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings and the places where he worked. He goes to the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos to see the creatures that Aristotle saw, where he saw them. He explores AristotleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s observations,\nhis deep ideas, his inspired guessesÃ¢â‚¬â€and the things he got wildly wrong. He shows how AristotleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s science is deeply intertwined with his philosophical system and reveals that he was not only the first biologist, but also one of the greatest.\n\nThe Lagoon is both a travelogue and a study of the origins of science. And it shows how a philosopher who lived almost two millennia ago still has so much to teach us today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cce7994cf40d9317d12f580dd811641b8bd7704","amp;dn":"The+Lagoon-+How+Aristotle+Invented+Science+by+Armand+Marie+Leroi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cce7994cf40d9317d12f580dd811641b8bd7704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,206,121,148,207,64,217,49,125,18,245,128,221,129,22,65,184,189,119,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
