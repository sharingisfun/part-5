Written to mark his 40th birthday in 1965, Eclat is a study of resonance written for 15 instruments. The title means 'burst' but also 'fragment, explosion, reflections of light', and it references Boulez's own dual roles as conductor and composer by giving the conductor control over when and how to cue elements of the ten-minute piece.\r\n\r\nRattle has been the Berlin Philharmonic's chief conductor and artistic director since 2002 and in autumn 2017 he returns to Britain to become music director of the London Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2362Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 256Kbps ABR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 6\r\nRun-Time: 100 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.84 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e161b013b71a565771559ac761ef40654e232a","amp;dn":"Simon+Rattle+Conducts+the+Berlin+Philharmonic+720p+HDTV+x264-MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e161b013b71a565771559ac761ef40654e232a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,225,97,176,19,183,26,86,87,113,85,154,199,97,239,64,101,78,35,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
