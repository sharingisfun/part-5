They live on the streets, do drugs, and sell themselves to men and women. Mike is quiet, gay and suffers from narcolepsy. Abandoned as a child, he is obsessed with finding his long-lost mother. Scott is the rebellious son of a high-ranking family, who lives this life mostly to embarrass his father. Mike is in love with Scott, who still maintains he is straight and insists that his wild lifestyle on the streets is only temporary. Together, they embark on a quest to find Mike's mother, traveling from Portland to Idaho to Italy, with Scott picking up a beautiful girl along the way.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : My.Own.Private.Idaho.1991.720p.HDTV.DD5.1.x264-DON.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 4.50 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 5 623 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 5 746 Kbps\n      Width : 1 280 pixels\n      Height : 720 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AC-3\n      Codec ID : A_AC3\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Language : English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102494/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102494/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English and Portuguese subtitles (srt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1cf83392883a5e8326d81fb96b6d41e93890c9c","amp;dn":"My.Own.Private.Idaho.1991.720p.HDTV.DD5.1.x264-DON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1cf83392883a5e8326d81fb96b6d41e93890c9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,207,131,57,40,131,165,232,50,109,129,251,150,182,212,30,147,137,12,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
