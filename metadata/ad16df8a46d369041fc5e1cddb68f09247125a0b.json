I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.\n\nSOME INFO (imdb):\nThe movie is the first to accomplish (for Turkish filming industry):\nBiggest movie set ever built.\nHighest budget amongst Turkish movies up to date. (5 million dollars)\nLongest awaited movie (three years, due to problems with the production company)\n\nSOME CAST (imdb):\nCem Yilmaz\t.... \tArif/Commander Logar\t\nRasim Oztekin\t....\tBob Marley Faruk\t\nOzkan Ugur\t.... \tGaravel\t\nIdil Firat\t.... \tMulu\t\nSafak Sezer\t.... \tKuna\t\n&amp;Ouml;zge &amp;Ouml;zberk\t.... \tPrincess Ceku\t\nErdal Tosun\t.... \tRendroy\t\nOzan Guven\t.... \t216-Robot\t\nCezmi Baskin\t....\tAmir Tocha\n\n\nEnglish subs included, i got them from [http://www.divxforever.com]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad16df8a46d369041fc5e1cddb68f09247125a0b","amp;dn":"G.O.R.A.+Bir+Uzay+Filmi+%28GORA+-+A+Space+Movie%2C+Turkish+Science+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad16df8a46d369041fc5e1cddb68f09247125a0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,22,223,138,70,211,105,4,31,197,225,205,219,104,240,146,71,18,90,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
