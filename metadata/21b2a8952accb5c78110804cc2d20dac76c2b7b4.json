It stars Maximilian Schell and Rod Steiger. It won three awards at the 1981 MontrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©al World Film Festival. I have ripped it at the highest possible rates to ensure quality. I will also be relasing the DVD-R torrent shortly.\n\nCast\n\n    * Maximilian Schell as Professor David Malter\n    * Rod Steiger as Reb Saunders\n    * Robby Benson as Danny Saunders\n    * Barry Miller as Reuven Malter\n    * Hildy Brooks as Mrs. Saunders\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chosen_%28Potok_novel%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chosen_%28Potok_novel%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082175/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082175/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NAmAKaACf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NAmAKaACf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nFew stories offer more warmth, wisdom, or generosity than this tale of two boys, their fathers, their friendship, and the chaotic times in which they live. Though on the surface it explores religious faith--the intellectually committed as well as the passionately observant--the struggles addressed in The Chosen are familiar to families of all faiths and in all nations.\n\nIn 1940s Brooklyn, New York, an accident throws Reuven Malther and Danny Saunders together. Despite their differences (Reuven is a Modern Orthodox Jew with an intellectual, Zionist father; Danny is the brilliant son and rightful heir to a Hasidic rebbe), the young men form a deep, if unlikely, friendship. Together they negotiate adolescence, family conflicts, the crisis of faith engendered when Holocaust stories begin to emerge in the U.S., loss, love, and the journey to adulthood. The intellectual and spiritual clashes between fathers, between each \nson and his own father, and between the two young men, provide a unique backdrop for this exploration of fathers, sons, faith, loyalty, and, ultimately, the power of love.\n\nProduct Description\n\n&quot;Anyone who finds it is finding a jewel. Its themes are profound and universal.&quot;\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nIt is the now-classic story of two fathers and two sons and the pressures on all of them to pursue the religion they share in the way that is best suited to each. And as the boys grow into young men, they discover in the other a lost spiritual brother, and a link to an unexplored world that neither had ever considered before. In effect, they exchange places, and find the peace that neither will ever retreat from again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21b2a8952accb5c78110804cc2d20dac76c2b7b4","amp;dn":"The+Chosen+DVD+Rip%2C+AVI+Xvid+%28Film+of+Potok+Novel%29+Extras+Includ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21b2a8952accb5c78110804cc2d20dac76c2b7b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,178,168,149,42,204,181,199,129,16,128,76,194,210,13,172,118,194,183,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
