Tolstoy's genius is clearly seen in the multitude \nof characters in this massive chronicle, all of them fully realized \nand equally memorable. Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound \nexamination of the individual's place in the historical process, one \nthat makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric \npowers and placed War and Peace in the same category as The Iliad.\n\nWar and Peace was translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude.\n\nAbout the reader:\n\nAlexander Scourby\nNovember 13, 1913 - February 22, 1985\n\nThe precise, mellifluous voice of Alexander Scourby, trained in Shakespearean \nroles in the 1930's and perfected in radio dramatic parts in the 1940's, \nbecame a well-known sound on Broadway, in motion pictures, and on television, \nwhere as Harriet Van Horne has observed, he is &quot;the most sensitive and \nknowing narrator in the business.&quot; His most appreciative audience, however, \nis found among the nearly 80,000 borrowers of Talking Books, the recordings \nof literature produced under the supervision of the Division for the \nBlind of the Library of Congress for the use of the legally blind. Scourby, \nduring his lifetime recorded over 500 books for the blind and has described \nhis recording of Audio books as, &quot;the one work that really means something \nto me.&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56063307dfb59ef87f9aed222c06ef296723ebe","amp;dn":"War+and+Peace+-+Leo+Tolstoy++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56063307dfb59ef87f9aed222c06ef296723ebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,96,99,48,125,251,89,239,135,249,174,210,34,192,110,242,150,114,62,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
