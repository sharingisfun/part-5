In the last 4 years involved in music production, he realised that he likes his drum &amp; bass deep and soulful. He is trying to ballance the deepness and musicality of his sound with big enough beats and bass to keep the dancefloor alive. With a number of 12&quot;s on Hype's Liqweed Ganja and Twisted Individual's Allsorts in the pipeline, he is definately one to keep an eye on.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Escape (feat. Darrison)\n02.
