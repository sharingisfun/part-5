Ten Little Indians) is a 1974 film  version of the Agatha Christie mystery novel of the same name. Two previous theatrical adaptations were released in 1945  and 1965, and a made-for-television  version was broadcast in 1959. This was the second of three versions of Christie's novel to be adapted to the screen by producer Harry Alan Towers; the aforementioned 1965 version, this one is 1974, and yet another in 1989. It follows the script of the 1965 version, right down to calling the Oliver Reed character &quot;Hugh&quot; (a name change made to accommodate Hugh O'Brian in the earlier version) instead of &quot;Phillip,&quot; which was character's name in the novel and play, though this particular adaptation is set in an abandoned hotel in the Iranian desert; the film was shot in the Shah Abbas Hotel in Iran during its pre-revolution days. The film's run time is an hour and thirty-eight minutes and it is the first film version of the novel to be filmed in color.\n\n\n\nFile: Ten Little Indians - Oliver Reed.avi\nFilesize: 943.53 Mb ( 989 358 054 bytes )\nPlay length: 01:38:18.259 (176771 frames)\nSubtitles: Not Present\nVideo: 640x480 (1.33:1), 29.970 fps, XviD MPEG-4 ~1199 kbps avg, 0.13 bit/pixel\nAudio: 48 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~128.00 kbps avg\n\n\n\nPoster:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/ialnlaAcF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/ialnlaAcF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mAlNcaACF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mAlNcaACF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaLNeaAcf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaLNeaAcf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaLnFAaCf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaLnFAaCf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n!!!Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¸Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â£Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½, Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¾-Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‹Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â£Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¬ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‹Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‹Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â£Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‹Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â« Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â­Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã…â€œÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â£ Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¤Ãƒï¿½Ã‹Å“Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¬Ãƒï¿½Ã…â€œÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â£!!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9b80763825a2fae56b43f3c0c50793a12b86328","amp;dn":"Ten+Little+Indians+1974-+Oliver+Reed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9b80763825a2fae56b43f3c0c50793a12b86328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,184,7,99,130,90,47,174,86,180,63,60,12,80,121,58,18,184,99,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
