These issues are being considered carefully by a wide range of professionals working in oncology, the Departments of Health and other bodies. There is now a substantial service development to ensure that Acute Oncology is appropriately provided in order to improve outcomes and wellbeing of patients. This book uses the Problem Solving format to produce a text which will be of value to everyone involved in planning and delivery of acute oncology care throughout the UK. The issues raised here will be equally valuable in an international context. The book is formally supported by the Association of Cancer Physicians (ACP).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed10b105a69f9785bfe65d2d2637d8fcd29ab7b0","amp;dn":"Problem+Solving+in+Acute+Oncology+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed10b105a69f9785bfe65d2d2637d8fcd29ab7b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,16,177,5,166,159,151,133,191,230,93,45,38,55,216,252,210,154,183,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
