James Cameron, Jerry Weintraub, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and clean energy investor and environmental activist Daniel Abbasi are executive producers of the series. Joel Bach and David Gelber, former 60 Minutes producers, are co-creators of the series as well as executive producers. Joseph Romm and Heidi Cullen are the chief science advisors. \nThe weekly episodes feature celebrity investigators, who each have a history of environmental activism, and well-known journalists, each of whom have a background in environmental reportage. These &quot;correspondents&quot; travel to areas around the world and throughout the U.S. affected by global warming to interview experts and ordinary people affected by, and seeking solutions to, the impacts of climate change. They act as proxies for the audience, asking questions to find out people's opinions and to discover the scientific evidence. The celebrities include Harrison Ford, Matt Damon, Ian Somerhalder, Jessica Alba, Don Cheadle, America Ferrera, Michael C. Hall, Olivia Munn and Schwarzenegger. The journalists include Lesley Stahl, Thomas Friedman, Chris Hayes and Mark Bittman. The final episode includes Friedman's interview of President Barack Obama.\nSchwarzenegger reflected on why the issue of climate change has not yet resonated strongly with the public despite the warnings from the scientific community: &quot;I think the environmental movement only can be successful if we are simple and clear and make it a human story. We will tell human stories in this project. The scientists would never get the kind of attention that someone in show business gets\n\n\n1)  Dry Season \nHarrison Ford goes to Indonesia to investigate how the world's appetite for palm oil has inadvertently created one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Back in the U.S., Don Cheadle meets a climate scientist and Evangelical Christian, with a very different explanation for the Texas drought. And, Pulitzer Prize-winner Thomas L. Friedman travels to Syria, examining how climate change can be a stress point in a volatile political situation. Series premiere.\n\n2)  End of the Woods \nHarrison Ford continues his investigation into the global effects of the palm oil industry, exploring the corruption that has deforested the Indonesian landscape and created the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger joins an elite team of wild-land firefighters known as &quot;Hot Shots&quot; as they battle a new breed of forest fires made more deadly by climate change, and discovers another killer wiping out trees at an even faster rate than the fires.\n\n3)  The Surge \nMSNBC's Chris Hayes shadows Staten Island's Republican Congressman - and climate change skeptic - Michael Grimm in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, questioning what he might have learned about climate change in the process. Conservationist M. Sanjayan travels to the far ends of the earth - including Christmas Island - to interview some of the worlds top climate scientists as they collect key data unlocking the future of our planet's changing climate.\n\n4)  Ice and Brimstone \nLesley Stahl of '60 Minutes' travels to Greenland to investigate the effects of global warming in the Arctic. Down south, Ian Somerhalder travels to North Carolina to listen in on both sides of the evangelical community's debate over climate change and finds himself caught in the middle of not only a religious debate, but a familial one: the father is a megachurch preacher who doesn't believe in climate change; the daughter is an activist trying to shut down the local coal-fired power plant.\n\n5)  True Colors \nOlivia Munn profiles climate-conscious Governor Jay Inslee of Washington State, discussing the issues he's faced since being elected. Meanwhile, 'New York Times' columnist Mark Bittman probes New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on the topic of man-made climate change during the rebuilding of his state's coastline in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. Christie once acknowledged the scientific consensus on climate change, but steadfastly refused to discuss it during the rush to rebuild.\n\n6)  Winds of Change \nAmerica Ferrera profiles prominent skeptic James Taylor of the Heartland Institute as he crusades against clean energy, and investigates the battle over the future of renewable energy in the US. 'New York Times' columnist Mark Bittman returns to conduct a yearlong investigation into natural gas, which has been touted as &quot;America's energy source&quot; and a way towards a cleaner, greener future. But is it true?\n\n7)  Revolt Rebuild Renew \nJessica Alba meets three members of Climate Corps - an innovative MBA-focused program - as they try to convince America's corporations that sustainability can actually boost their bottom lines. Pulitzer Prize-winner Thomas L. Friedman finds himself in Egypt to explore how what happens in the wheat fields of Kansas plays out on the volatile streets of Cairo. And MSNBC's Chris Hayes reveals an intimate story about life after Superstorm Sandy, with the most economically vulnerable trying to survive the impacts of climate change.\n\n8)  A Dangerous Future \nMatt Damon investigates the impact of extreme heat on human health and mortality, with a focus on research that has uncovered how rising temperatures are creating a worldwide public health emergency. Michael C. Hall visits Bangladesh to explore the prediction that by 2050, a global migration of upwards of 150 million people will produce the single most daunting burden to our future. And Thomas L. Friedman travels to Yemen to conclude his look into how climate stress can push volatile political situations over the edge.\n\n9)  Moving a Mountain \nMichael C. Hall concludes his journey to the low-lying country of Bangladesh, where rising seas are expected to ultimately submerge 17% of the nation. Conservationist M. Sanjayan returns to further question some of the world's top climate scientists as they collect key data unlocking the past and future of our planet's changing climate. His destination: Tupungatito, the northernmost historically active stratovolcano in the southern Andes.
