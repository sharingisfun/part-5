Perfect for fans of Nicci French and Tana French.\r\nThe morning was quiet, the playground peaceful. Inside two little girls sit by the swings. Their mother was with them only a second ago, but then the older girl blinked and she vanished. The police are called and their family traced. But their mother -- a well-respected professional -- would never just disappear and leave her children alone.\r\nWould she? 12 hours later she is found by an off-duty police officer -- a detective with problems of her own. The missing woman has no explanation for where she has been, and seemingly no recollection of what it is she has done.\r\nDesperate for answers, the people who surround her begin to dig into the mystery that is her disappearance, and it soon becomes clear is that no two people have the same understanding of what happened that day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a78cc66869e70586d36aa3028d61c39dcd2450fd","amp;dn":"The+Missing+Hours+%28Emma+Kavanagh%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a78cc66869e70586d36aa3028d61c39dcd2450fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,140,198,104,105,231,5,134,211,106,163,2,141,97,195,157,205,36,80,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
