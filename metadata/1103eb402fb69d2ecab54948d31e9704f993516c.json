With &quot;Nostril&quot;, \n\nthis French musician draws from his impressive \n\nrecording experience to create a dense and \n\nparticularly wild ride that puts enthusiasm and \n\nenergy back in your stereo: fast beats, sudden \n\nbreaks, majestic moments, the whole thing \n\ncrystal clear and more detailed than the most \n\nroccoco paintings. Free of any recognizable \n\ninfluences, new and very fun: here's quite a \n\ntremendous slap in the face from an act to \n\nfollow closely. \n\nA compact, dense and wild affair, &quot;Nostril&quot; is \n\nIgorrr's coming of age album, in which the \n\nskills gathered with the previous ones are \n\nfocused into a highly musical, seductive whole. \n\nCarried on by its playfulness, insanity and \n\nself-assurance, we find ourselves bouncing up, \n\nthrashing out or head-nodding furiously, as we \n\nall wished we would again one day.
