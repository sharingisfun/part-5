Topics examined in detail include the three major crises of Ben Johnson's positive test in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the creation of the World Anti-Doping Association, and the House Committee on Government Oversight's probe into steroid use. The author provides a critical examination of the current ban on steroids, and boldly advocates a common-sense solution to the complex problem of steroid use in sport: the adoption of harm-reduction strategies and policies rather than outright proscription.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 211 pages\n# Publisher: Praeger; 1 edition (August 15, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0313380244\n# ISBN-13: 978-0313380242","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b301a09ad4ceaeb0f347726e443404e485eb92","amp;dn":"Steroids%3A+A+New+Look+at+Performance-Enhancing+Drugs+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b301a09ad4ceaeb0f347726e443404e485eb92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,179,1,160,154,212,206,174,176,243,71,114,110,68,52,4,228,133,235,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
