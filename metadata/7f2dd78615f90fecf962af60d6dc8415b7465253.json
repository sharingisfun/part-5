The compositions are all written by Omar Sosa and Paolo Fresu, except for Under African Skies , a version of the popular track from Paul Simon s Graceland.  Blending acoustic and electronic sounds, the two create expansive interior landscapes in 11 original compositions enlivened by Afro-Latin rhythms and brightened by sensitive improvisation.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f2dd78615f90fecf962af60d6dc8415b7465253","amp;dn":"Paolo+Fresu+and+Omar+Sosa+-+Alma+%5Bmp3-320-2012%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f2dd78615f90fecf962af60d6dc8415b7465253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,45,215,134,21,249,15,236,249,98,175,96,214,220,132,21,183,70,82,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
