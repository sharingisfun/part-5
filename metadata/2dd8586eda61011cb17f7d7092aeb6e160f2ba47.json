Her only hope is a marriage of convenience with the notorious widower, Lyon Pennington, fourth Earl of Aytoun, who just may be the most handsome-and caring-man she's ever encountered.\n\n- Captured Dreams Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Book 2:\n\nMay McGoldrick returns with the latest in a trilogy about love-and the birth of a nation...\n\nPortia Edwards will go to any length to find the family she's never known. And when she meets merchant Pierce Pennington, a staunch but secretive Son of Liberty, Portia has the perfect chance to ask for his help. But her stubborn pride keeps her silent. That is, until she recognizes her strong attraction to the brave man who, by night, is known as the infamous Captain MacHeath, smuggling arms by sea under the pall of darkness-all in the name of liberty...\n\n\n- Dreams of Destiny Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Book 3:\n\nWounded by scandal and the unsolved murder of his sister-in-law, David Pennington is outwardly insolent and arrogant.
