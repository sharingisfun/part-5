The town of Middle Spring is more than happy to welcome them with open arms, however; located in the rhinestone buckle of the Bible Belt, Middle Spring is smack-dab in the middle of a big barbecue and tent revival and there's always room at their table for a few more warm bodies. Unfortunately, no one in Middle Spring is exactly who they seem to be--- this town takes the 'the body and the blood' quite literally, and the friends have to stick together as time begins to run out and they realize that what's on the menu may be closer to home than they suspected.\r\n\r\nDirector: Shawn Ewert\r\nWriters: Shawn Ewert (story), Shawn Ewert\r\nStars: Avery Pfeiffer, Troy Ford, Brittany Badali \r\nGenres: Drama | Horror | Thriller\r\nCountry: USA\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: Sacrament.2016.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO\r\n                                            \r\nSOURCE: 720p - Thanks King-DVD!                                              \r\n\r\nViDEO: 1800 Kbps -2 Passes\r\n\r\nRESOLUTiON: 720x400\r\n\r\nRUNTiME: 1h 37m 43s \r\n\r\nSUBTiTLES: No                             \r\n\r\nAUDiO: 192 Kbps AC3 2.0      \r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\nNOTES: Enjoy.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS TO: The Big Boss WIGWIG, ANSA, ACHOSINK,\r\n                HAMADA, MAZENTBT, CD-Moonlight, EMPEROR_DVD.    \r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aHys \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aHy7 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aHyc \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aHy1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c3822393bca5eac3f06ee717dcb61fc8e602a3","amp;dn":"Sacrament.2016.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c3822393bca5eac3f06ee717dcb61fc8e602a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,195,130,35,147,188,165,234,195,240,110,231,23,220,182,31,200,230,2,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
