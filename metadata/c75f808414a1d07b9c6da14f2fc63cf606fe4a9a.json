It won't get any better than this.\n\nMade possible with a copy of the game, and the following guide:\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/561545/33592\n\nNOTE: The WAV files kept crashing iTunes when I tried converting them to MP3s, so I had to use a different encoder.  The file sizes are considerably smaller than my other GTA rips, but the quality is the same.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c75f808414a1d07b9c6da14f2fc63cf606fe4a9a","amp;dn":"GTA+Vice+City+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c75f808414a1d07b9c6da14f2fc63cf606fe4a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,95,128,132,20,161,208,123,156,109,161,79,47,198,60,246,6,254,74,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
