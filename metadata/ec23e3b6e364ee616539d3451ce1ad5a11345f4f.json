How do we see in three dimensions? How do we remember names and faces? How is it, indeed, that we ponder the nature of our own consciousness? Why do we fall in love? In this bold, extraordinary book, Pinker synthesizes the best of cognitive science and evolutionary biology to explain what the mind is, how it has evolved, and, ultimately, how it works. This edition includes a new afterword that explores the impact of the book and its relevance today.\n\nISBN 978-0393334777 \n672pp\nPublished by W. W. Norton &amp; Company\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec23e3b6e364ee616539d3451ce1ad5a11345f4f","amp;dn":"PINKER%2C+Stephen+-+How-the-Mind-Works.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec23e3b6e364ee616539d3451ce1ad5a11345f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,35,227,182,227,100,238,97,101,57,211,69,28,225,173,90,17,52,95,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
