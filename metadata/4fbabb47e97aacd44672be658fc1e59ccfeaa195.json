And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself.\n\nDaniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology has turned computational, a cat's-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking refuge in the Oregon desert, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turned his back on a humanity that shatters into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out.\n\nNow heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet found the man she's sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes them all to a meeting with something they will only call Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Angels of the Asteroids.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTheir pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man, face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought itself.\n\nPublication Date: August 26, 2014\nRead by Adam J Rough\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 48 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fbabb47e97aacd44672be658fc1e59ccfeaa195","amp;dn":"Peter+Watts+-+Echopraxia+%28Firefall+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fbabb47e97aacd44672be658fc1e59ccfeaa195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,186,187,71,233,122,172,212,70,114,190,101,143,193,229,156,207,234,161,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
