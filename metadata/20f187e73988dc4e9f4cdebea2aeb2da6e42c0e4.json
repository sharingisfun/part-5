Under the tutelage of Goldie, the duo has delivered a long player that proudly wears its influence on its sleeve. The first thing that hits you about the album is its unmistakeable energy, ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the type of energy the UK has excelled at within dance music and the excitement is clearly palpable on this project.\n\nThe overall aesthetic of the album is funk, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the marriage of organic groove and electronic power. Both constituent parts compliment rather than detract and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s there that the aforementioned funk aesthetic comes alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f187e73988dc4e9f4cdebea2aeb2da6e42c0e4","amp;dn":"Ulterior+Motive+-+The+Fourth+Wall+%282014%29+Album+%40+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f187e73988dc4e9f4cdebea2aeb2da6e42c0e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,241,135,231,57,136,220,78,159,76,222,190,162,174,178,218,110,66,192,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
