It wass shot in b/w and and developmental colour format from (French) Thompson. In the end, only the b/w version was ever shown due to technical difficulties, until in 1995 the Thompsoncolour version culd be restored. This is the colour version.\n\nPlot:\nOnce a year the fair comes for one day to the little town 'Sainte-Severe-sur-Indre'. All inhabiters are scoffing at Francois, the postman, what he seems not to recognize. The rising of the flagstaff under his direction nearly leads into a catastrophy - but everybody tells him, how important his work is. Sneering up Francois continues in the evening of the festive day. Made drunk, some 'friends' persuade him to watch a short-movie in a tent. This film is a stunt-show, covered as 'The modern delivery-techniques of the US-post. Francois takes it serious, not recognizing being teased. Next day, after getting sober in a goods wagon, he reorganizes his own delivery-methods. He has not the equipment, as his ideals in the short-movie have, but using only his bicycle, he makes good, funny progresses.\n\nVideo quality is identic to my master, a not-gorgeously but okay recompressed DVD-R. \n\nwith love\nfrom love\n\nFREAKYFLICKS -- WHERE WINGS TAKE DREAM\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...
