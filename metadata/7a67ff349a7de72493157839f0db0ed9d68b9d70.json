The books became best sellers, with no novel in the series selling fewer than 3.5 million copies.[1] With The Rebels, The Seekers and The Furies, Jakes became the first author to have three books on the New York Times bestseller list in a single year (1975).[2]\n\nThe books feature different members of the Kent family, connecting them with historical events at the time of the American Revolution. The first novel begins just before the American Revolution, with Frenchman Phillipe Charboneau, who travels to England and later to the New World, changing his name to Philip Kent along the way and meeting several key figures of the Revolution, including the Marquis de La Fayette, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, Joseph Warren, and others. The saga ends some generations later in 1890, with the death of Gideon Kent in The Americans. The series was originally intended to continue until 1976, covering 200 years.[3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kent_Family_Chronicles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kent_Family_Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Bastard (1974) \nThe Rebels (1975) \nThe Seekers (1975) \nThe Furies (1976)\nThe Titans (1976)\nThe Warriors (1977)\nThe Lawless (1978)\nThe Americans (1979)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a67ff349a7de72493157839f0db0ed9d68b9d70","amp;dn":"The+Kent+Family+Chronicles+%288+book+historical+fiction+series%29+by","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a67ff349a7de72493157839f0db0ed9d68b9d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,103,255,52,154,125,231,36,147,21,120,57,240,219,14,217,214,139,157,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
