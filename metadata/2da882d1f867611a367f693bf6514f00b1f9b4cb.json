Based on logical principles, the raw vegan diet still often falls short of expectation. Instead of improvements in their health, many people see deterioration. Others experience less rejuvenation than they anticipated, or find themselves unable to maintain balance in the long-term. This results solely from a lack of understanding of the guiding principles of natural diet, from the widespread misinformation about it, and the gross errors that follow. The 31, succinct chapters give unique insights on many topics affecting those considering a high-raw or all-raw diet. Each holds dozens of tips to help you eat a pure, simple, nourishing diet. If you are tired of the same, boring, repetitive information found in nearly every other book on the raw vegan diet, then you're in for a surprise! If you seek groundbreaking research and a fresh perspective on raw eating, you will find them in The Raw Secrets. Here are some topics covered: * The deadly errors of the raw food diet and how to avoid them * The most overlooked and important causes for lack of energy * Why certain foods are poisons and drugs and how to find out which ones to are * An absolutely effective and low-cost way to give up bad habits * All about a healthy diet that doesn't require you to buy special supplements * Sure signs that the diet you're on is not working for you (even if it's raw) * The easiest and best way to transition to a raw food diet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da882d1f867611a367f693bf6514f00b1f9b4cb","amp;dn":"The+Raw+Secrets%3A+The+Raw+Food+Diet+in+the+Real+World%2C+2nd+Editio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da882d1f867611a367f693bf6514f00b1f9b4cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,168,130,209,248,103,97,26,54,127,105,59,246,81,79,0,177,249,180,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
