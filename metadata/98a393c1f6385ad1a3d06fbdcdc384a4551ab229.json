Burnside. His take on the droning, circular guitar riffs indigenous to the blues of the north Mississippi hill country, coupled with his electric band's skull-crushing power, is enough to send listeners into hypnotic convulsions of rapture. However, Mississippi Hill Country Blues, culled from sessions in the late 1960s and early 1980s, features Burnside solo on acoustic guitar. The results, stark and clear in the absence of his customary distortion and sonic upheaval, are spectacular.\n\nThough the performances here are as intense as his electric sets, this album's spare aesthetic makes it possible to concentrate closely on Burnside's intricate guitar technique, which sets repeating motifs and rhythms against each other to create a seemingly ragged yet tightly controlled propulsive energy. The 19-song track list includes several Burnside favorites, including &quot;Poor Black Mattie,&quot; and a fierce slide treatment of &quot;Shake 'Em on Down.&quot; The lesser-known &quot;Skinny Woman&quot; and &quot;Jumper on the Line&quot; are no less compelling. Superior production, highlighting Burnside's playing and his no-nonsense, freely phrased singing, makes Mississippi Hill Country Blues a must for fans, and an excellent introduction for the uninitiated.\n\nTracklist\n1.
