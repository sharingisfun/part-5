Many of his novels are set in fictional realms that resemble real places during real historical periods, such as Constantinople during the reign of Justinian I or Spain during the time of El Cid. Those works are published and marketed as historical fantasy, though the author himself has expressed a preference to shy away from genre categorization when possible.\n\nFormat: .ePUB | Retail\n\nFile Listing:\n\n+ A Song for Arbonne\n\n+ Lord of Emperors\n\n+ River of Stars\n\n+ Sailing to Sarantium\n\n+ The Darkest Road\n\n+ The Fionavar Tapestry Omnibus (Note: Not a retail version, but a very good formatted version)\n\n+ The Last Light of the Sun\n\n+ The Lions of Al-Rassan\n\n+ The Summer Tree\n\n+ The Wandering Fire\n\n+ Tigana\n\n+ Under Heaven\n\n+ Ysabel\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nI noticed that, there was a lack of Guy Gavriel Kay books on TPB, so thought I should upload it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257f01b98c3a688962a85975f1e3002c0ed36945","amp;dn":"Guy+Gavriel+Kay+-+11+books+%28Retail+.ePUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257f01b98c3a688962a85975f1e3002c0ed36945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,127,1,185,140,58,104,137,98,168,89,117,241,227,0,44,14,211,105,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
