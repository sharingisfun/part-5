While the other musicians are featured in their houses or on Havana's colorful, crumbling, crowded streets, Ochoa rambles alone, in the industrial outskirts where the sugar cane harvest rolls into the capital -- where the work of the countryside laborer meets the industrial center. With his guitar high on his chest and his cowboy hat, Ochoa does not evoke the jazz-age charm of his older bandmates; he's a border musician, a guajiro -- a country boy whose music took him from passing the hat in his native Santiago to the heights of international superstardom. \n\nOchoa is often called the Cuban Johnny Cash, and not only because he wears a black suit. His voice isn't the velvet and smoke of his Buena Vista Social Club costars Ibraim Ferrer and Compay Segundo. His range is so versatile that he can hit both high and low registers, with the same kind of rumble, menace, and high-pitched plaint that make Cash the working man's bard. \n\nWith this latest record, Ochoa is, as the title suggests, Better Than Ever. Ochoa was not particularly the star of Buena Vista Social Club -- not as old as ninety-ish Compay Segundo nor as romantically overlooked as Ruben Gonzalez or Ibrahim Ferrer, he has the advantage of not having to live up to his onscreen mythology. Ochoa is a rare thing in the surprisingly diverse Cuban folk music scene: a traditionalist rather than a relic; a subtle innovator rather than a twenty-first century update. \n\ncontinues here &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/o/ochoaeliades-estoy.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/o/ochoaeliades-estoy.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n...With Estoy Como Nunca, Ochoa has proved that staying close to home -- taking the time to really know it -- takes you farther than the most ambitious of border-crossings. \n\n--by Margaret Schwartz\n\nESTOY COMO NUNCA was nominated for the 2003 Latin Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Album.\n\nPersonnel:\nEliades Ochoa (vocals, guitar)\nHumberto Ochoa (guitar, background vocals)\nEglis Ochoa (clave, maracas, background vocals)\nJose Angel Martinez (double bass, background vocals)\nJorge Marurell (drums, percussion)\n\nGuests:\nRaul Malo (Los Lobos) (vocals in track 3)\nDavid Hidalgo (Los Lobos) (guitar in track 1) \nAnibal Avila (trumpet, background vocals)\n\nFiles:\n01- Estoy como nunca.mp3\n02- Arrimate pa'ca.mp3\n03- No me preguntes tanto.mp3\n04- Siboney.mp3\n05- Pena.mp3\n06- Con dolor en el alma.mp3\n07- El chicharron es pellejo.mp3\n08- Ella si va.mp3\n09- Mi cafetal.mp3\n10- Llora mi nena.mp3\n11- Sus ojos se cerraron.mp3\nEliades Ochoa - Estoy Como Nunca [back].jpg\nEliades Ochoa - Estoy Como Nunca [front].jpg\nrelease-notes.nfo\n\nAlbum cover encoded in each track (Visible in iTunes, Winamp, others)\nFormat: MP3, CBR 320 Kbit/s, 44100, stereo. encoder LAME 3.97 --preset insane -m s\n\nEnjoy and seed!\n\nPastafari\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cccf492d160cae72cab73783df535049efd524c","amp;dn":"%28Buena+Vista+Social+Club%29+Eliades+Ochoa+-+Estoy+Como+Nunca+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cccf492d160cae72cab73783df535049efd524c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,204,244,146,209,96,202,231,44,171,115,120,61,245,53,4,158,253,82,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
