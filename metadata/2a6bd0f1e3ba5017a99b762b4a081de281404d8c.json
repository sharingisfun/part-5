Has God Seen My Shadow? An Anthology 1989-2011 is a collection that brings together 20 outstanding performances from LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums for Sub Pop and Beggars Banquet, and also features 12 previously unreleased tracks from LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s archives. The physical editions of this set also include a booklet with reproductions of LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original handwritten lyrics.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6bd0f1e3ba5017a99b762b4a081de281404d8c","amp;dn":"Mark+Lanegan+-+Has+God+Seen+My+Shadow+%5B2CD%5D+An+Anthology++%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6bd0f1e3ba5017a99b762b4a081de281404d8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,107,208,241,227,186,80,23,169,155,118,43,74,8,29,226,129,64,77,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
