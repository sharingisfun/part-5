This is a lighthearted book with a serious purpose: to question the assumptions behind the dogma and sheer hype that the dominant school of neoliberal economists-the apostles of the free market-have spun since the Age of Reagan.Chang, the author of the international bestseller Bad Samaritans, is one of the world's most respected economists, a voice of sanity-and wit-in the tradition of John Kenneth Galbraith and Joseph Stiglitz. 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism equips readers with an understanding of how global capitalism works-and doesn't. In his final chapter, &quot;How to Rebuild the World,&quot; Chang offers a vision of how we can shape capitalism to humane ends, instead of becoming slaves of the market.Ha-Joon Chang teaches in the Faculty of Economics at the University of Cambridge. His books include the bestselling Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism. His Kicking Away the Ladder received the 2003 Myrdal Prize, and, in 2005, Chang was awarded the Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought.\n\n\n\n*Guardian-'Chang may be our best critic of capitalism, but he is far from being any kind of anti-capitalist. He recognises the failings of centrally planned economies, and rightly describes capitalism as &quot;the worst economic system except for all the others.&quot;\n....'if Chang's reforms are unrealistic, his account of where we find ourselves today is arrestingly accurate. For anyone who wants to understand capitalism not as economists or politicians have pictured it but as it actually operates, this book will be invaluable.'\n\n\n*LSE Review Of Books-'The book draws on many of our other present-day economic problems Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as inequality, extremes of poverty and wealth and the financial crisis in the Western world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and how these relate directly to the policies and mixed incentives of free-market economics. The ease with which the text flows, the succinctness of each chapter, and the fact that the author makes no assumptions about the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depth of knowledge on this system of capitalism broadens the appeal of the book beyond those involved in academic study of economics.'\n\n*Sunday Times-'Lively, accessible and provocative ... read this book'\n\nHa-Joon Chang is one of the leading heterodox economists and institutional economists specialising in development economics.
