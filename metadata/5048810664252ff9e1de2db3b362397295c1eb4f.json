Known to be a survivor of the Blight and the Champion of Kirkwall, the legend around Hawke's rise to power is shrouded in myth and rumor.\n\nFeaturing an all-new story spanning 10 years, players will help tell that tale by making tough moral choices, gathering the deadliest of allies, amassing fame and fortune, and sealing their place in history. The way you play will write the story of how the world is changed forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5048810664252ff9e1de2db3b362397295c1eb4f","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+2+%5BMAC%5D+%5BNative%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5048810664252ff9e1de2db3b362397295c1eb4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,72,129,6,100,37,47,249,225,222,45,179,179,98,57,114,149,193,235,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
