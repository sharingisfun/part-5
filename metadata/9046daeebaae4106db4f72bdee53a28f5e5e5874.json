Well, thanks to the great state of Florida you can now know for certain.\n\nBehold, the &quot;The Satanic ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Big Book of Activities,&quot; a coloring book that is being disseminated across Orange County public schools, according to Raw Story. \n\nThe details: A Christian group received permission to distribute Bibles and other religious materials to their students, leading atheist groups to appeal for an equal opportunity. It wasn't long before the Satanic community hopped on board as well. \n\n&quot;If a public school board is going to allow religious pamphlets and full Bibles to be distributed to students -- as is the case in Orange County, Florida -- we think the responsible thing to do is to ensure that these students are given access to a variety of differing religious opinions, as opposed to standing idly by while one religious voice dominates the discourse and delivers propaganda to youth,&quot; the Satanic TempleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spokesperson, Lucien Greaves, explained in a statement.\n\n&quot;I am quite certain that all of the children in these Florida schools are already aware of the Christian religion and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bible, and this might be the first exposure these children have to the actual practice of Satanism. We think many students will be very curious to see what we offer.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9046daeebaae4106db4f72bdee53a28f5e5e5874","amp;dn":"The+Satanic+Children%26rsquo%3Bs+Big+Book+of+Activities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9046daeebaae4106db4f72bdee53a28f5e5e5874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,70,218,238,186,174,65,6,219,79,114,189,238,83,162,143,94,94,88,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
