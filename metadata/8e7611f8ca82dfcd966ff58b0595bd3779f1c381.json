Lea was born and lived in Philadelphia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n. . Lea became a member of the newly-formed American Historical Society and contributed a number of articles to its publication, American Historical Review. Lea was elected president of the American Historical Society in 1903. When the second annual meeting of the newly-formed American Folklore Society was held in Philadelphia in 1889, Lea met with some of the founders, sent an article for publication in the Society's journal, and became the first life-member of the organization.\nThe Henry Charles Lea Library, named in his honor, includes much of his personal collection of books and manuscripts. Speakers at the opening dedication in 1925 included Professor George Lincoln Burr of Cornell University, who worked to complete the manuscript of Lea's Materials for a Study of Witchcraft; Professor Dana C. Munro of Princeton University, vice president of the American Historical Association, who had used Lea's collections as a young scholar; and Hampton L. Carson, Philadelphia historian and former attorney general of Pennsylvania.\nAs an authority on the Spanish Inquisition Lea stood in the highest rank of modern historians, and distinctions were conferred on him by the universities of Harvard, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Giessen and Moscow. . .\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e7611f8ca82dfcd966ff58b0595bd3779f1c381","amp;dn":"The+History+of+Inquisition+Library+by+HC+Lea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e7611f8ca82dfcd966ff58b0595bd3779f1c381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,118,17,248,202,130,223,205,150,111,245,139,5,149,189,55,121,241,195,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
