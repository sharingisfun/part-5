Jiu'er, the wife bought by the leper, and her lover, take over the winery and set up an idealized quasi-matriarchal community headed by Jiu'er. When the Japanese invaders subject the area to their rule and cut down the sorghum to make way for a road, the community rises up and resists as the sorghum grows anew.\n\nRestored version, ripped from the germany Arthaus DVD (credits to jonsi - KG)\n\nAbout the restoration:\n\nBased on a 35mm Interpositive this film has been digitized and restored to HD-resolution on behalf of Kinowelt label Arthaus. The wide-screen Cinemascope (2,35:1) format has been captured to the maximum of the image, which causes every splice in the film to be a case of manual retouch. Prior to the scanning we performed a scene-by-scene color correction to perfectly represent the various skin tones and also underline the artful use of color accents that the director had in mind for the scenes. The restoration process reduced dust and scratch, blotches and stains, as well as numerous vertical lines that were printed in the material. With every step of the restoration process the beautiful film of famous director Yimou Zhang (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾HeroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾House of Flying DaggersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Leben!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ) became clearer and regained its original beauty. The resulting mastertape in HDCAM-SR will now be the source for the release as DVD and BluRay disk. It carries both, a restored german and the original mandarin sound track. - Alpha-Omega.\n\n\nIncludes English and German soft subs.\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caHiHAadM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caHiHAadM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAhIBAADM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAhIBAADM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CaHiCaadm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CaHiCaadm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAhIDaadm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAhIDaadm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Name ..........: HONG GAO LIANG (Yimou Zhang) 1987.avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 1.283.792.896 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 1.253.704 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 1.224,32 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 1.156.390.680 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 1.129.288 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 1.102,82 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:28:28\nVideo Codec Code ...: XVID\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1742 KB/s\nResolution .........: 720 x 320\nAspect Ratio .......: 2.25:1\nTotal Frames .......: 132701 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 25 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 12 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0,302 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: No\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 127.392.000 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 124.406 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 121,49 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:28:28\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43f1f2377c728b489020838002099b467b8685e","amp;dn":"Yimou+Zhang+-++Red+Sorghum+%5BRestored%5D+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43f1f2377c728b489020838002099b467b8685e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,63,31,35,119,199,40,180,137,2,8,56,0,32,153,180,103,184,104,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
