Almost every failed startup has a product. What failed startups don't have is traction -- real customer growth. \n\nThis book introduces startup founders and employees to the &quot;Bullseye Framework,&quot; a five-step process successful companies use to get traction. This framework helps founders find the marketing channel that will be key to unlocking the next stage of growth. \n\nTraction is a guide to getting customers, written for startup founders, marketers, and those interested in how today's startups grow and get traction. This book shows you how the founders of several of the biggest companies and organizations in the world like Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit), Paul English (Kayak.com) and Alex Pachikov (Evernote) have built and grown their startups. We interviewed over forty successful founders and researched countless more growth stories to pull out the repeatable tactics and strategies they used to get traction. \n\n&quot;Many entrepreneurs who build great products simply don't have a good distribution strategy.&quot; -- Mark Andreessen, venture capitalist \n\nToo often, startups spend months (or years) building a product only to struggle with traction once they launch. This struggle has startups trying random tactics - some ads, a blog post or two - in an unstructured way that leads to failure.
