The course covers\n\n    drawing basic and complex shapes, setting colors and styles,\n\n    adding shadows, patterns, and gradients, more advanced techniques\n\n    such as scaling, rotating, and compositing objects, and how to\n\n    incorporate Canvas elements in a slideshow and an animation.\n\n    Exercise files are included with the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Topics include:\n\n\n\n    * Understanding the differences between Canvas and SVG Graphics\n\n    * Drawing shapes\n\n    * Drawing arcs and paths\n\n    * Rendering text\n\n    * Using clipping paths\n\n    * Drawing images and video\n\n    * Transforming objects with the translate tag\n\n    * Manipulating raw pixels\n\n    * Applying a custom transformation\n\n    * Creating an animation or slideshow control with Canvas\n\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpack, burn or mount and enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\nGREETINGS\n\n\n\n\n\nWe salute our friends, our loyal members and our fair competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n                      THE ALMIGHTY QUASAR   2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de6d245971c268939458587af5d20da54bc143df","amp;dn":"Lynda.com.HTML5.Graphics.and.Animation.with.Canvas-QUASAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de6d245971c268939458587af5d20da54bc143df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,109,36,89,113,194,104,147,148,88,88,122,245,210,13,165,75,193,67,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
