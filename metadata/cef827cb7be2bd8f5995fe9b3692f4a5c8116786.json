B Evans\n\nI pretty much have been a ROCKER all of my 35 years, but as I get older, I can appreciate the qualities of other styles of music now. I have never really liked country music, even though, some songs catch my ear sometimes. I look for hooks in songs, that goes for rock, classical, jazz, folk, and country and other styles. If I like it, I like it. It doesnt matter what kind of music it is. Thats what I am talking about when I listen to Hal Ketchum. From the first time I heard Small Town Saturday Night, and the awesome, and deep I Know Where Love Lives (two of the best songs on this compilation). These two songs are my favorites, as far as hooks go, but to tell you the truth, the whole cd is great. Hal just has that unique voice that sets him apart from anyone else. If you want great country music, or just great music for that matter, get this one. Heck, get all of his recordings....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef827cb7be2bd8f5995fe9b3692f4a5c8116786","amp;dn":"Hal+Ketchum+-+The+Hits+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1996+Country+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cef827cb7be2bd8f5995fe9b3692f4a5c8116786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,248,39,203,123,226,189,143,89,149,254,155,54,146,244,165,200,17,103,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
