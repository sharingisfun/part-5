The great-granddaughter of the town matriarch, she's sweet, cute and quiet. Too quiet. Hanna has a moment of epiphany when she realizes her crush for forever, Raiden Ulysses Miller, is not ever going to be hers. She sees her life as narrow and decides to do something about it. Raiden Miller is the town of Willow's local hero. An ex-marine with the medal to prove his hero status, he comes home, shrouded in mystery. It takes a while but, eventually, Hanna catches his eye. But after all these years of Raid and Hanna living in the same town, the question is, why? Is Raid interested in Hanna because she's sweet and cute? Or does Raid have something else going on? \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27aa1a588b2f8a0e7eb6d899d5dba01c4b283589","amp;dn":"Raid+%28Unfinished+Heroes+%233%29+by+Ashley+Kristen+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27aa1a588b2f8a0e7eb6d899d5dba01c4b283589","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,170,26,88,139,47,138,14,126,182,216,153,213,219,160,28,75,40,53,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
