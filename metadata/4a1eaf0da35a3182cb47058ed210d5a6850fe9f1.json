When I read the book Blue Gold, I knew immediately I must utilize my film talents to relay the urgency of prioritizing our fresh water management for the survival of our race. I had no idea of the financial and physical risks that making this film would entail at the time, and if I did I honestly would not have made the film. Luckily for the world, the film exists, and so it is my goal to follow the advise of the first press review which proclaimed &quot;Every person on the planet must see this film&quot;. In this respect I thank godcanjudgeme for uploading this torrent and bringing a new audience to the film.\n\nI have seen film festival audiences around the world transformed by the stories of the heroes of the water wars. I am thrilled that in the US and Canada the DVD is available via http://shoppbs.org and http://amazon.ca respectively. I respect the internet community that chooses to view films through torrents like this for whatever reason. In fact my first documentary, Hackers Wanted, focuses on the philosophy of true hackers and their journeys exploring cyberspace.\n\nIt is important to understand that independent films costs a great deal of personal finances to create, in this case over $100,000. In order that I may make other films in the future, I must at least make my money back. I respectfully ask that if you download the film you consider donating $5-$10 to the further publicity of the film via PayPal on my site http://www.bluegold-worldwaterwars.com. Also consider reviewing the film favorably on IMDB and recommending that others buy the DVD.\n\n\nSincerely,\nSam Bozzo\nFilmmaker\nBLUE GOLD: WORLD WATER WARS&quot;\n\n===========================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bluegold-worldwaterwars.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bluegold-worldwaterwars.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1137439/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1137439/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===========================\n\n&quot;If the wars of this century were fought over oil, the wars of the next century will be fought over water.&quot;\nWorld Bank Vice President Ismail Serageldin\n\nAs the source of all life enters the global marketplace and political arena.
