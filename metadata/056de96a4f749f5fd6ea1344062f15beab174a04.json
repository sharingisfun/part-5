I know they are coming fast but don't worry. They should be seeded for many months to come. You will have time to get them if the history of the original MTCDC is any guideline.\n\nWhat's This?\nIt's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\nPlus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this. Here we go again.\n\nThis Second installment is: Action Comics\nThis comic has had many characters featured as main or backup, but obviously the most frequent and famous is Superman. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/1153/actioncomics001.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/1153/actioncomics001.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/604/actioncomics252.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/604/actioncomics252.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/2417/actioncomics1000000.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/2417/actioncomics1000000.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/8984/actioncomics900a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/8984/actioncomics900a.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/1034/actioncomics900b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/1034/actioncomics900b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img101.imageshack.us/img101/786/actioncomics900c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img101.imageshack.us/img101/786/actioncomics900c.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nToday's offering is\nAction Comics 001-900 (1938-2011)\nAction Comics 1,000,000 (1998 )\nAction Comics Zero ctc (10-1994)\nAction Comics Annual 01-12 (1991-2007)\nAction Comics 851 3D\nAction Comics Alternate Scans (misc)\nAction Comics Covers (misc variants)\nAction Comics DC Archives v2 and covers for the rest\nAction Comics Superman story reprints Included because some old issues are fiche.\nAction Comics Whole Issue Reprints\n\tMillennium Edition 032-Action Comics 252\n\tMillennium Edition 001-Action Comics 001\n\tAction Comics 001-Famous 1st Editions C26 (1974)\nPreviews Feb-Action Comics 826 Sneak Preview\n\n\nAn interesting fake of Action #1 is included as the issue 1 of the main seres. It's meant to look like like a beat-up original but was faked from a reprint. The cover has been replaced by me with a scan of an undamaged reprint. Any copy of Action #1 is very valuable and no one will ever likely subject one to scanning. This is generally speaking the most expensive comic one can buy. Some copies of some others beat some copies of Action #1 but the record prices belong to Action. Not just because it is the first appearance of Superman but because it is the first true superhero story. Superheroes have had some slight influence on the comic business in the years since.\n\n\nPlease Seed! Lots of people will start on the series months or even a year or two from now. You are their only hope to complete their downloads.\n\n=========================================================================\nThanks to the Scanners and editors, and thanks to the seeders, the\nanonymous folk that make the work of the scanners and uploaders multiply!\n=========================================================================\nSee Yah!\n\n\n13\n\nYou can see my other torrents at \n\nd-e-m-o-n-o-id.me/files/?uid=1213225&amp;seeded=2\n\nor\n-h-3-3-t.com-/userdetails.php?id=72866\n\nor &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/joshua13/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/joshua13/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:056de96a4f749f5fd6ea1344062f15beab174a04","amp;dn":"Action+Comics-More+Than+Complete+DC+NMC+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"056de96a4f749f5fd6ea1344062f15beab174a04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,109,233,106,79,116,159,95,214,234,19,68,6,47,21,190,171,23,74,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
