It revolves around a man - double-crossed by his partner and cuckolded by his wife - seeking not retribution, but only his share of the loot. But nothing or no one will stop a stoic Lee Marvin from doing whatever it takes to remove the layers of henchmen, slick operators and cagey entrepreneurs that stand in his way to Mr. Big and his money. Alcatraz provides a stark landscape upon which the final acts are played out, making the film even more memorable. The violence is best served cold in this one and there will be no happy ending. If you like Asphalt Jungle, The Killing and/or Reservoir Dogs, put this one on your list to see for the first or the second or even third time.\n\nCAST\n\n\tLee Marvin\t... \tWalker\n\n\tAngie Dickinson\t... \tChris\n\n\tKeenan Wynn\t... \tYost\n\n\tCarroll O'Connor\t... \tBrewster\n\tLloyd Bochner\t... \tFrederick Carter\n\tMichael Strong\t... \tStegman\n\n\tJohn Vernon\t... \tMal Reese\n\tSharon Acker\t... \tLynne\n\nAVI Information\n    Filename: Point Blank (1967) DVDRip (SiRiUs sHaRe).avi\n    Filesize: 734797824 Bytes (700,76 MB)\n    Streams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\n\nVideo Stream\n    Compression: xvid - XVID MPEG-4\n    Avg.
