Might need to rethink that. OK, it's a show filled with sketches written and performed by John Finnemore, but now no longer arranged in strict order of funniness. Also, he's cut the sketch that would have gone first.\n\n John promises to stop doing silly sketches about nonsense like Winnie the Pooh's honey addiction or how goldfish invented computer programming, and concentrate instead on the big, serious issues: why do posh men's trousers turn red when they get drunk? Is it possible to collect all the stamps? And who invented the little tripod thing you get in pizza boxes?\n\n \n \n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/finnemore_souvenir_programme/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/finnemore_souvenir_programme/&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n \n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n\n \nJohn Finnemore's Souvenir Programme - S01 (4x30 Minutes)\n\nJohn Finnemore's Souvenir Programme - S02 (6x30 Minutes) + Edinburgh Fringe Special\n \nJohn Finnemore's Souvenir Programme - S03 (6x30 Minutes) \n \nJohn Finnemore's Souvenir Programme - S04 (6x30 Minutes) \n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name : John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme.mp3\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFile size : 25.4 MB\nDuration (ms) : 27mn 44s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String : Constant\nTotal bitrate : 128 Kbps\nAlbum : John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme - Series 0?\nTrack name : John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme - S0? - E0?\nTrack position : ?\nPerformer : John Finnemore\nGenre : Speech\nRecorded_Date : 2011\nEncoded library : LAME3.99r\nComment : MP3's Recorded By Slimoo\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nDuration (ms) : 27mn 47s\nBitrate mode : Constant\nBitrate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String : Lossy\nStream size : 25.4 MB (100%)\nEncoded library : LAME3.99r\nEncoded library settings : -m j -V 4 -q 3 -lowpass 17 -b 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dfb9f9d12609c17b41d70b1be9d8e8d2f06ed73","amp;dn":"John+Finnemore%27s+Souvenir+Programme+-+S01+to+04+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dfb9f9d12609c17b41d70b1be9d8e8d2f06ed73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,251,159,157,18,96,156,23,180,29,112,177,190,157,142,141,47,6,237,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
