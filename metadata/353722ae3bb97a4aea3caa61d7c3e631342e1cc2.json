Oriented toward casual users who want to solve specific problems, the book pays attention to such troubles as parity error messages and out-of-memory warnings.\n\n\n Upgrading &amp; Fixing PCs for Dummies promotes the ideas that you shouldn't fix things that aren't broken and that you should apply the simplest possible solutions to the broken things. The guide includes excellent coverage of the hardware-management features in Windows 95.\n\n This book's problem-oriented approach yields sections about common hardware-related problems, such as, &quot;My printer puts out only junk characters!&quot; and &quot;How do I install a new hard drive?&quot; Cartoon-like sequential diagrams outline physical procedures, such as installing and removing SIMMs. Similar drawings help you find key parts of your computer, such as the PCI slots and the video port.\n\n Overall, Upgrading &amp; Fixing PCs for Dummies, Third Edition, does what all the Dummies books do--it clearly explains how to solve certain problems. If your particular troubles happen to fall outside of what's covered here, you'll need to consult a geekier reference book. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\n Review\n They layout is clever...it is useful as a quick reference book. -- Computer Shopper, London, June 2000 --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/aa61/12aa8de5f.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:353722ae3bb97a4aea3caa61d7c3e631342e1cc2","amp;dn":"Upgrading+%2C+Fixing+%2CTroubleshooting+and+Maintaining+Your+PC+All+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"353722ae3bb97a4aea3caa61d7c3e631342e1cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,55,34,174,59,185,122,74,234,60,170,97,215,195,230,49,52,46,28,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
