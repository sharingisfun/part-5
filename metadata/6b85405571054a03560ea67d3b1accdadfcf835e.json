Otherwise, this is a slick retelling of the Twain classic, with Huck escaping both the oppressive kindliness of the widow Douglas (Elizabeth Risdon) and the brutality of his drink-sodden Pap (Victor Kilian) by faking his own death. He heads down the Mississippi River in the company of fugitive slave Jim (Rex Ingram), who hopes to be reunited with his wife and child. Along the way, they get mixed up in the larcenous schemes of the &quot;King&quot; (Walter Connolly) and the &quot;Duke&quot; (William Frawley.) When Jim stops in his flight to save Huck's life after the latter is bitten by a rattler, the slave is captured and sentenced to be hanged for the &quot;murder&quot; of the still-missing Huck. The boy returns the favor by revealing that he's still alive (completely bypassing the hilarious episode in the book wherein Huck and Tom Sawyer--who has been written out of this filmization--map an elaborate jail breakout scheme). The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is most familiar to baby-boomers via the 30-minute abridged version made available for school showings in the 1960s. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031020/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031020/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector: Richard Thorpe\n\n\n\n\n\tMickey Rooney\t... \tHuckleberry Finn\n\tWalter Connolly\t... \tThe 'King'\n\tWilliam Frawley\t... \tThe 'Duke'\n\tRex Ingram\t... \tJim\n\tLynne Carver\t... \tMary Jane\n\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:27:11\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1518 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b85405571054a03560ea67d3b1accdadfcf835e","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Huckleberry+Finn+%281939%29+Mickey+Rooney+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b85405571054a03560ea67d3b1accdadfcf835e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,133,64,85,113,5,74,3,86,14,166,125,59,26,204,218,223,207,131,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
