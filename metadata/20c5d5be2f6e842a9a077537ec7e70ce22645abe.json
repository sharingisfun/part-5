From a bleak and often inaccessible landscape arose an artistic tradition so vibrant and sophisticated that even China's emperors commissioned works. With the spread of Buddhism in the West, inspired by the leadership of the exiled Dalai Lama, and the controversy over Tibet's status, interest in this mysterious land has never been greater. This book covers the entire history of Tibetan art, focusing on the inextricably intertwined relationship between the art and the spiritual life of the region. From the Potala in Lhasa - one of the world's greatest religious complexes - to painting, sculpture, manuscripts, silk embroidery and a highly developed tradition of portraiture and ritual objects, Tibet's unique artistic culture is vividly presented in this compelling study","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20c5d5be2f6e842a9a077537ec7e70ce22645abe","amp;dn":"Art+of+Tibet+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20c5d5be2f6e842a9a077537ec7e70ce22645abe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,197,213,190,47,110,132,42,154,7,117,55,236,126,112,206,34,100,90,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
