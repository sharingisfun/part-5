It tells the story of Armon Jarles, a man on the edge, living amidst the disputes of two rival powers at large in the world. 360 years after a nuclear holocaust ravaged mankind, throwing society back into the dark ages, the world is fraught with chaos and superstition. The new rulers over the masses of humanity are the techno-priests of the Great God, endowed with scientific knowledge lost to the rest of humanity.\n\n\nRead by Jonathan Davis\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: Variable\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9cd6cfd581ae86b53ba8c6ec8b18709a5ef75a","amp;dn":"Fritz+Leiber+-+Gather%2C+Darkness%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9cd6cfd581ae86b53ba8c6ec8b18709a5ef75a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,156,214,207,213,129,174,134,181,59,168,198,236,139,24,112,154,94,247,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
