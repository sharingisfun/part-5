Gold, always a prudent asset to own, has become the single most important wealth preservation tool for banks and individuals alike. Rickards draws on historical case studies, monetary theory, and personal experience as an investor to argue that: \r\nThe next financial collapse will be exponentially bigger than the panic of 2008.\r\nThe time will come, sooner rather than later, when there will be panic buying and only central banks, hedge funds, and other big players will be able to buy any gold at all. \r\nIt s not too late to prepare ourselves as a nation: there s always enough gold for a gold standard if we specify a stable, nondeflationary price. \r\nProviding clear instructions on how much gold to buy and where to store it, the short, provocative argument in this book will change the way you look at this barbarous relic forever.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c748e2dab98e5ae6e5521e615f5106df6d337520","amp;dn":"James+Rickards%2C+%26quot%3BThe+New+Case+for+Gold%26quot%3B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c748e2dab98e5ae6e5521e615f5106df6d337520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,72,226,218,185,142,90,230,229,82,30,97,95,81,6,223,109,51,117,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
