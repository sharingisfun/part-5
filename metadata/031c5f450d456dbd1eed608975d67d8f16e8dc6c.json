CANNON appeared every week for two and a half years in Overseas Weekly, a newspaper distributed exclusively to U.S. Military bases around the world. Uncensored by commercial editorial restrictions, Wood pulled out all the stops Ã¢â‚¬â€ producing a thrilling and salacious Cold War spy serial run amok with brutal violence and titillating sex all in an effort to boost morale and support our troops!\n\nMeet John Cannon, the perfect agent and America's exploitative answer to James Bond. Initially brainwashed by the terrifying, voluptuous, and always half naked Madame Toy to be &quot;the perfect assassin&quot; for the Red forces, Cannon was eventually rescued and brainwashed (again) by the CIA until he had no emotions whatsoever. Under the employ of our governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Central Intelligence Agency, Cannon experiences action like no other agent! Undercover and under the covers, Cannon endures nude torture by beautiful women, explosive gunplay, naked catfights, bone-crunching plastic surgery, nudity, Hitler, nihilistic lovemaking, Weasel the spy, naked women, death from above, and more naked women! Take that, 007!\n\nTogether with the Wallace Wood Estate, and working from newly unearthed source material, Fantagraphics Books presents the biggest, baddest, best-looking collection of CANNON, ever!\n\n&quot;Pow! Zam! Comics arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for kids anymore because of Cannon! Cannon is like a punch in the face with a cement-filled giant salami. Ugly description? Wait'll you see CannonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ugly mug! And the gals? Wood style, of course! What else do you need?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gilbert Hernandez\n\n&quot;I bow to no man in my appreciation for Cannon.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Daniel Gillespie Clowes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031c5f450d456dbd1eed608975d67d8f16e8dc6c","amp;dn":"Wallace+Wood+-+Cannon+%282014%29+%28digital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031c5f450d456dbd1eed608975d67d8f16e8dc6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,28,95,69,13,69,109,189,30,237,96,137,117,214,125,143,22,232,220,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
