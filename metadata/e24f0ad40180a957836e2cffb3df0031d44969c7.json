For the first week of recording, Fruit Bats\nleader Eric D. Johnson brought in a full band to capture some of the live\nexcitement of 2009's The Ruminant Band. However, having recently worked\nalone on soundtracks for an extended period, Johnson knew that he wanted\nTripper to be more of a solitary pursuit than his previous album. The\nresulting album, a bittersweet meditation on hitting the road, leaving the\nfamiliar behind and reinventing yourself, is a reinvention itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24f0ad40180a957836e2cffb3df0031d44969c7","amp;dn":"Fruit_Bats-Tripper-2011-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24f0ad40180a957836e2cffb3df0031d44969c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,79,10,212,1,128,169,87,131,110,44,255,179,223,0,49,212,73,105,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
