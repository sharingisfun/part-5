This sweepstake ingurgitation has now pumped the sources dry and has sent prices skyrocketing for what remains, just at a time when American museum funds are falling behind the rate of general inflation. But the result is not entirely disastrous, for it forces us to take stock of what we raked together bit by bit as chances offered, and to catalogue the holdings that have grown almost without our being aware of the growth. While a few excellent catalogues have been published, mostly by the Morgan Library, the Frick Collection, and this Museum, American collections are still so little known that we ourselves in the museums are unaware of treasures in nearby museums, and are sometimes unaware of remarkable things in other departments of our very own buildings. It would be useful if all American museums would pool their resources for countrywide surveys of some scarcer specialties like, say, German drawings, Islamic glass, Greek jewelry, or Romanesque sculpture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c668256cc142ab7dd1a80e590f94d80041dd8f","amp;dn":"Architectural+and+Ornament+Drawings+-+Juvarra%2C+Vanvitelli%2C+the+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c668256cc142ab7dd1a80e590f94d80041dd8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,198,104,37,108,193,66,171,125,209,168,14,89,15,148,216,0,65,221,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
