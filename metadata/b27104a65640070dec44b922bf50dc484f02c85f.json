Dating back thousands of years to ancient Babylonia, beer is the most famous and beloved thirst quencher the world has ever known. The Bible praises it, Egyptians were buried with it, our Founding Fathers depended on it, medical journals prescribe it, and Noah and the Mayflower set sail with it. Whether kegged, bottled, canned, free-flowing, or whipped into Golden Cheesecake, beer is all about friendship, laughter, and celebrating life to its fullest.\n\nMore than ten years in the making, The Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook is an unprecedented collection of more than 400 food and drink recipes containing beer as a main ingredient. From scrambled eggs made with beer at breakfast and a cheese steak sandwich with onion rings or a beer burger and Chocolate Beershake for lunch, to a surf 'n' turf beer-infused combo of lobster and steak for dinner (and a midnight snack of chocolate-dipped strawberries), beer lovers can feast on brewskis at any time of the day. Every genre of food is included: appetizers, breads, soups and chili, salads, fruits and vegetables, sandwiches, sauces, marinades, beef, poultry, pork, wild game, stews, fish and seafood, pasta, and desserts.\n\nThe Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook also serves as a party drinks handbook, with a comprehensive collection of recipes for mixed drinks, chuggers, shots, chasers, party punches, milkshakes, and flaming drinks -- all made with beer. From the Buzzy Navel, Beer Bullet, Red-Headed Mary, and Beertini to the Woodpecker, Atomic Diva, Garden of Eden Punch, and Flaming Sake Bomb, this anthology of beer's greatest pairings is sure to leave beer lovers spinning for joy.\n\nWith an introduction chronicling beer's history, as well as hilarious beer quotes by the world's most illustrious beer fans peppered amidst the recipes, The Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook is a rousing tribute to a tasty icon more than 7,000 years in the making.\n\n\nCumberland House | English | 2009-05-01 | ISBN: 1402230931 | 256 pages | PDF ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b27104a65640070dec44b922bf50dc484f02c85f","amp;dn":"The+Beer+Lover%27s+Cookbook+-+More+Than+300+Recipes+All+Made+With+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b27104a65640070dec44b922bf50dc484f02c85f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,113,4,166,86,64,7,13,236,68,185,34,191,80,220,72,79,2,200,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
