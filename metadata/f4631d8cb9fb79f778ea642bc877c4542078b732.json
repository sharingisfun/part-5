It was his last solo album before adding The Innocent Criminals to his line-up. Reviews were generally very positive, praising Harper&amp;#039;s fusion of multiple genres, from folk (&quot;Another Lonely Day&quot;), folk rock (&quot;Gold to Me&quot;), Black Sabbath-style riffing heavy metal (&quot;Ground on Down&quot;) and politically-charged reggae (&quot;Excuse Me Mister&quot;).\n\nAfter Harper&amp;#039;s well-received debut, Welcome to the Cruel World, he expanded on his fanbase by touring relentlessly with jam bands like Dave Matthews Band. On this, his second album, Harper added a more refined sense of his own intense spirituality, such as on the gospel-influenced album closers, &quot;Power of the Gospel&quot;, &quot;God Fearing Man&quot; and &quot;One Road to Freedom&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Oppression&quot; (Harper) ? 2:58\n   2. &quot;Ground on Down&quot; (Harper) ? 4:53\n   3. &quot;Another Lonely Day&quot; (Harper) ? 3:43\n   4. &quot;Please Me Like You Want To&quot; (Harper) ? 4:55\n   5. &quot;Gold to Me&quot; (Harper) ? 5:00\n   6. &quot;Burn One Down&quot; (Harper) ? 3:31\n   7. &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot; (Harper, Plunier) ? 5:24\n   8. &quot;People Lead&quot; (Harper) ? 4:13\n   9. &quot;Fight for Your Mind&quot; (Harper) ? 4:06\n  10. &quot;Give a Man a Home&quot; (Harper) ? 3:35\n  11. &quot;By My Side&quot; (Harper) ? 3:34\n  12. &quot;Power of the Gospel&quot; (Harper) ? 6:02\n  13. &quot;God Fearing Man&quot; (Harper) ? 11:49\n  14. &quot;One Road to Freedom&quot; (Harper) ? 4:14\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4631d8cb9fb79f778ea642bc877c4542078b732","amp;dn":"Ben+Harper+-+Fight+for+Your+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4631d8cb9fb79f778ea642bc877c4542078b732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,99,29,140,185,251,121,247,120,234,100,43,200,119,196,84,32,120,183,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
