The French surrealist continues to be important for his groundbreaking focus on the visceral, the erotic, and the relation of society to the primeval.  The wellsprings of Bataille's work apparently lay in personal experience, in particular his childhood with a suicidal mother and a blind, syphilitic father, and yet his ideas resonated deeply with other mid-century philosophy and helped to pave the way to contemporary critical theory.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format (in varying degrees of quality) unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* THE ACCURSED SHARE: An Essay on General Economy, Vol. 1: Consumption (Zone Books, 1988).
