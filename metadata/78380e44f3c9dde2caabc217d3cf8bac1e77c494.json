She trained as a professional actress at Trinity College, Dublin, and has worked in theater, film and voice-over.\n\nDublin Murder Squad:\n\nIn The Woods: As dusk approaches a small Dublin suburb in the summer of 1984, mothers begin to call their children home. But on this warm evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find only one of the children gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers, and unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours.\n\nTwenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a twelve-year-old girl is found murdered in the same woods, he and Detective Cassie MaddoxÃ¢â‚¬â€his partner and closest friendÃ¢â‚¬â€find themselves investigating a case chillingly similar to the previous unsolved mystery. Now, with only snippets of long-buried memories to guide him, Ryan has the chance to uncover both the mystery of the case before him and that of his own shadowy past.\n\nRichly atmospheric, stunning in its complexity, and utterly convincing and surprising to the end, In the Woods is sure to enthrall fans of Mystic River and The Lovely Bones. And look for French's new mystery, Broken Harbor, for more of the Dublin Murder Squad.\n\nThe Likeness: The haunting follow up to the Edgar Award-winning debut *In the Woods*\n\nTana French astonished critics and readers alike with her mesmerizing debut novel, In the Woods. Now both French and Detective Cassie Maddox return to unravel a case even more sinister and enigmatic than the first. Six months after the events of In the Woods, an urgent telephone call beckons Cassie to a grisly crime scene. The victim looks exactly like Cassie and carries ID identifying herself as Alexandra Madison, an alias Cassie once used. Suddenly, Cassie must discover not only who killed this girl, but, more importantly, who is this girl? A disturbing tale of shifting identities, The Likeness firmly establishes Tana French as an important voice in suspense fiction. And look for French's new mystery, Broken Harbor, for more of the Dublin Murder Squad.\n\nFaithful Place: Tana French's In the Woods and The Likeness captivated readers by introducing them to her unique, character-driven style. Her singular skill at creating richly drawn, complex worlds makes her novels not mere whodunits but brilliant and satisfying novels about memory, identity, loss, and what defines us as humans. With Faithful Place, the highly praised third novel about the Dublin Murder squad, French takes readers into the mind of Frank Mackey, the hotheaded mastermind of The Likeness, as he wrestles with his own past and the family, the lover, and the neighborhood he thought he'd left behind for good.\n\nBroken Harbor: Mick &quot;Scorcher&quot; Kennedy, the brash cop from Tana FrenchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling Faithful Place, plays by the book and plays hard. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made him the Murder squadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top detectiveÃ¢â‚¬â€and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what puts the biggest case of the year into his hands.\n\nOn one of the half-built, half-abandoned &quot;luxury&quot; developments that litter Ireland, Patrick Spain and his two young children are dead. His wife, Jenny, is in intensive care.\n\nAt first, Scorcher and his rookie partner, Richie, think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be an easy solve. But too many small things canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be explained. The half dozen baby monitors, their cameras pointing at holes smashed in the SpainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ walls. The files erased from the SpainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ computer. The story Jenny told her sister about a shadowy intruder who was slipping past all the locks.\n\nAnd Broken Harbor holds memories for Scorcher. Seeing the case on the news sends his sister Dina off the rails again, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resurrecting something that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control: what happened to their family one summer at Broken Harbor, back when they were children.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
