It was also released the same day as his Dark Horse label debut Thirty Three &amp; 1/3.\nAs the Beatles' perpetual dark horse, Harrison rarely got the chance to write and sing more than one or two songs per album. But once the band split up, the former &quot;quiet one&quot; was quick out of the gate with a series of memorable hit singles that seamlessly merged his budding spirituality and an epic, Phil Spector-inspired pop sensibility. This collection, originally released in 1976, combines seven of Harrison's best-known Beatles numbers, including &quot;Something,&quot; &quot;If I Needed Someone,&quot; &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; with a half-dozen early solo hits including &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth),&quot; &quot;You,&quot; and &quot;What Is Life.&quot; As such, it's a good entry-level Harrison primer.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Something\n[02] If I Needed Someone\n[03] Here Comes The Sun\n[04] Taxman\n[05] Think For Yourself\n[06] For You Blue\n[07] While My Guitar Gently Weeps\n[08] My Sweet Lord\n[09] Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)\n[10] You\n[11] Bangla Desh\n[12] Dark Horse\n[13] What Is Life\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:44m:57s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 110mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t- 19 November 1976\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Parlophone EMI Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.georgeharrison.com \n\t\t\t- http://george-harrison.info \n \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6034039663c04e01d9ad00e363b00f482f79b7c8","amp;dn":"%5B1976%5D+The+Best+Of+-+George+Harrison+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6034039663c04e01d9ad00e363b00f482f79b7c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,52,3,150,99,192,78,1,217,173,0,227,99,176,15,72,47,121,183,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
