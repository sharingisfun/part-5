Middle-aged dentist Winston (Walter Matthau) is enjoying an affair with Toni (Goldie Hawn) but doesn't want to be hemmed in by marriage. He prevails upon his non-glamorous assistant Stephanie (Ingrid Bergman) to pose as his wife so as to keep from campaigning for a ring. Then, to justify his &quot;infidelity,&quot; Winston talks his pal (Jack Weston) into pretending to be Stephanie's illicit lover. Flattered by all the attention, Stephanie begins to &quot;doll up.&quot; Confronted by a newly gorgeous Stephanie, Winston realizes that his Dream Girl has been right there in his office all along. As for Toni, she ends up in the arms of a writer (Rick Lenz), who has loved her since Reel One. Cactus Flower was adapted by Billy Wilder's frequent collaborator I.A.L. Diamond from the play by Abe Burrows -- which in turn was adapted from a French farce. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064117/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064117/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:39:33\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x400  1.80:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1692 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,24 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98546ea704ba5fbe3ab1590de196e20a01522f28","amp;dn":"Cactus+Flower+%281969%29+Walter+Matthau+Eng+%28multisubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98546ea704ba5fbe3ab1590de196e20a01522f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,84,110,167,4,186,95,190,58,177,89,13,225,150,226,10,1,82,47,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
