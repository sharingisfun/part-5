Comprised of Cassie Ramone, Kickball Katy, and Ali, the Vivian Girls sprang into the indie circuit in 2008 with a handful of 7&quot; singles released on a passel of small labels, including &quot;Wild Eyes&quot; (Plays with Dolls Records), &quot;Orphanage&quot; (Woodsist Records), and &quot;I Can't Stay&quot; (In the Red Records). Their self-titled debut full-length was released on Mauled by Tigers Records and In the Red in September that same year. The record became something of a sensation and the trio spent the year touring and gaining fans the world over. Their quickly recorded follow-up album, Everything Goes Wrong, was released in late summer of 2009. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tIndie Rock\nLabel:\t\t\tPolyvinyl\t\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Other Girls\n02.I Heard You Say\n03.Dance (If You Wanna)\n04.Lake House\n05.Trying To Pretend\n06.Sixteen Ways\n07.Take It As It Comes\n08.Vanishing Of Time\n09.Death\n10.Light In Your Eyes\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                       ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3e60856009828c96b6d68c614c56485116e5cd","amp;dn":"Vivian+Girls+-+Share+The+Joy+%282011%29+mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3e60856009828c96b6d68c614c56485116e5cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,62,96,133,96,9,130,140,150,182,214,140,97,76,86,72,81,22,229,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
