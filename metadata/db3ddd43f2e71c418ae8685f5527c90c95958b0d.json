The instrument was extremely popular in Elizabethan England; Queen Elizabeth herself played one, and numerous instruments survive. Keyboard music thrived in the environment, with a strong folk and popular element, often with elaborate, fast variations (called divisions) added by composers to show off their craft.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosed.
