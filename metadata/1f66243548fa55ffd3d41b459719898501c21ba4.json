ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to go further... \n\nWhen enigmatic billionaire Ian Noble sets Lin the task of Ã¢â‚¬Å“tamingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ his brilliant yet half-savage brother Kam Reardon, she eagerly accepts. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than curious about the solitary genius and everything sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heard about him. During their electric first meeting, her fascination increases a hundredfold. Kam practically oozes raw sex appeal. Lin is interested...very interested. But does her intense attraction and willingness to go places with him sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never gone before in the bedroom really have to do with Kam? Or is her carefully hidden desire to blame for wanting a man she knows she can never have?\n\nAn elusive outsider, Kam avoids intimacy, yet never shies away from satisfying his erotic appetites. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something different about LinÃ¢â‚¬â€a reserve heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anxious to break. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a woman heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eager to take his time withÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and possess completely. A sophisticated beauty like her would never want him anywhere but in bed, but he finds himself unable to resist her.\n\nImmediately LinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smooth facade is undone by KamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overwhelming masculinity and by his irresistible erotic demandsÃ¢â‚¬â€a lesson in subjugation that leaves Lin confused, reeling, and open to things she never thought possible. Now, as the unpredictable nights between them grow darker, Lin and Kam are certain of only one thing: theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re made for each other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f66243548fa55ffd3d41b459719898501c21ba4","amp;dn":"Since+I+Saw+You+%28Beth+Kery%29+Retail+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f66243548fa55ffd3d41b459719898501c21ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,102,36,53,72,250,85,255,211,212,27,69,151,25,137,133,1,194,27,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
