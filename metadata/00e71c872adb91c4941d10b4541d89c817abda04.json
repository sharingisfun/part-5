With the release of &quot;Look at Me Now,&quot; the 21-year-old strips his latest single from &quot;F.A.M.E.&quot; of singing altogether; instead, the track is filled with tight, quick-flowing punch lines and bruising verses by hip-hop veterans Busta Rhymes and Lil Wayne. Although Busta's bullet-time contribution is worthy of a dropped jaw, Breezy is no novice on the microphone and also spits rapid rhymes with a few witty lyrics sprinkled in. The mesmerizing beat is juxtaposed with a simple yet alluring melody, and the combination is lethal as a whole. Whether as a result or in spite of recent headline-grabbing adversities, Brown has everyone looking at him now-and with this single, he'll be sure to keep their attention.\n\n Chris Brown- Feat Lil Wayne amp Busta Rhymes - Look At Me now\n\n\nAfter download please SEED, Thanks!
