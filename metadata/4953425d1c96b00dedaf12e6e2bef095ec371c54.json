As the 24-hour light of the arctic summer is transformed into darkness by an ash cloud from a recent volcanic eruption, a young reporter leaves Reykajvik to investigate on her own, unaware that an innocent personâ€™s life hangs in the balance. Ari ThÃ³r Arason and his colleagues on the tiny police force in SiglufjÃ¶rÃ°ur struggle with an increasingly perplexing case, while their own serious personal problems push them to the limit. What secrets does the dead man harbour, and what is the young reporter hiding? As silent, unspoken horrors from the past threaten them all, and the darkness deepens, itâ€™s a race against time to find the killer before someone else diesâ€¦ Dark, terrifying and complex, Blackout is an exceptional, atmospheric thriller from one of Icelandâ€™s finest crime writers. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4953425d1c96b00dedaf12e6e2bef095ec371c54","amp;dn":"Blackout+-+Ragnar+Jonasson+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4953425d1c96b00dedaf12e6e2bef095ec371c54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,83,66,93,28,150,176,13,237,175,18,230,226,190,240,149,236,55,28,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
