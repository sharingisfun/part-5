Yeats, his later work shows an interest in stark imagery, colors, and the open forms associated with &quot;naked&quot; poetry.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was primarily a poet, JimÃ©nez' prose work PLATERO AND I (1917), about a writer and his donkey, sold well in Latin America and in translation won him popularity in the U.S.  The little donkey remains a symbol of tenderness, purity and naivete, and is used by the author as a means of reflection about the simple joys of life, memories, and description of characters and their ways of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\r\n\r\n* Animal de fondo [Animal at Bottom] (Nobel Prize Library, 1971).
