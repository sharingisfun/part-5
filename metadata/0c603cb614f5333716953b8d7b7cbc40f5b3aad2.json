Written by Dale Carnegie and first published in 1936, it has sold 15 million copies world-wide.[1]\n\nLeon Shimkin of the publishing firm Simon &amp; Schuster took one of the 14-week courses given by Carnegie in 1934. Shimkin persuaded Carnegie to let a stenographer take notes from the course to be revised for publication.\n\n\nNote: This one's the same as many on TPB, the only difference is it has Bookmarks and content menu which makes it easy for readers to browse through sections and chose what they want to read first.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c603cb614f5333716953b8d7b7cbc40f5b3aad2","amp;dn":"Dale+Carnegie+-+How+to+Win+Friends+And+Influence+People+%5BWith+Bo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c603cb614f5333716953b8d7b7cbc40f5b3aad2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,96,60,182,20,245,51,55,22,149,59,141,123,124,188,64,245,179,170,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
