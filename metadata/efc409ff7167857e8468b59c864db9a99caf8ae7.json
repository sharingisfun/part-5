Tonra was performing on her own when she met guitarist Igor Haefeli, who joined Daughter along with drummer Remi Aguilella to complete the band's lineup. The trio self-released a demo as well as their 2011 debut EP His Young Heart, which led to Mumford &amp; Sons' label Communion releasing their second EP, the more polished and eclectic The Wild Youth, later that year. Early in 2012, Daughter signed with 4AD, who released the single Smother that October. The band's debut album, If You Leave, arrived in March 2013.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efc409ff7167857e8468b59c864db9a99caf8ae7","amp;dn":"Daughter+-+If+You+Leave+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efc409ff7167857e8468b59c864db9a99caf8ae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,196,9,255,113,103,133,126,132,104,181,156,134,77,185,169,156,175,138,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
