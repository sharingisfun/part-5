Their self-consciously dangerous image, leftist leanings, crunching hard rock, and outsider status made them favorites of the British music press and helped them build a rabidly dedicated following.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6895e6451ca48bb3f98f380f783910de706a95ef","amp;dn":"Manic+Street+Preachers+-+Futurology+%28Deluxe%29+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6895e6451ca48bb3f98f380f783910de706a95ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,149,230,69,28,164,139,179,249,143,56,15,120,57,16,222,112,106,149,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
