Collins that aims to describe how companies transition from being average companies to great companies and how companies can fail to make the transition. &quot;Greatness&quot; is defined as financial performance several multiples better than the market average over a sustained period. Collins finds the main factor for achieving the transition to be a narrow focusing of the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resources on their field of competence.\n\nJim Collins, co-author of Built To Last, has done it again! This time he spent 5 years trying to find out what differentiates good companies from great companies. This study can be applied to entrepreneurial ventures and to current corporate America. After reading this book you may see your company from a much different perspective than in the past and it may have you thinking about the effectiveness of senior managers within your company. I believe it is a book that business executives will read and keep handy for reference.\n\nThis book is a study of companies that exceed their industry, the overall stock market and produce PHENOMENAL returns over a 15-year period (15 of them are very Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ years and the next 15 years are full of explosive growth). \n\n\n\n\n\n=========================================================\n=========================================================\n\n&quot;Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, \nand the life of the candle will not be shortened.&quot;\n\n\n-- KNOWLEDGE never decreases by being shared!!\n\n\nShow your Thankfulness by seeding :)\nShow your Thankfulness by seeding :)\nShow your Thankfulness by seeding :)\nShow your Thankfulness by seeding :)\n\n\n=========================================================\n=========================================================\n\n\n\nIf you can afford, \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a279a393cd8610e8629b6921702efab640c473b","amp;dn":"Good+to+Great+-+Why+Some+Companies+Make+the+Leap...+and+Others+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a279a393cd8610e8629b6921702efab640c473b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,39,154,57,60,216,97,14,134,41,182,146,23,2,239,171,100,12,71,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
