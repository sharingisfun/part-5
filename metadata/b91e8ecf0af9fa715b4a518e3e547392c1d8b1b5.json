Whenever an application is available for OSX, we strongly recommend to use this version.\n\nWinOnX is based on the open source Wine project. It is a layer which redirects the communication between an application and Windows to OSX. As a result not all applications are fully compatible. Most applications run fine, some run even faster but also some run slower or even crash.\n\nYou can look at http://appdb.winehq.org/ to get some information how good your application might work with WinOnX which is an ongoing project. In case your Windows application does not work at the moment, there is a good chance that it will work after one of the next updates.\n\nCurrently full screen applications (especially games) are only limited supported. We are currently working on a version which will support both full screen for Snow Leopard as well as for Lion.\n\nWHATÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S NEW\n\nVersion 1.4:\n\nYou can install programs completely separate from each other.\nPrograms can be launched with different system settings.\nInstead of deinstalling programs, you can just delete the appropriate VM.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b91e8ecf0af9fa715b4a518e3e547392c1d8b1b5","amp;dn":"WinOnX+1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b91e8ecf0af9fa715b4a518e3e547392c1d8b1b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,30,142,207,10,249,250,113,91,74,81,142,62,84,115,146,193,216,177,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
