But there is often little useful guidance as to how this is best done. By solving puzzle positions? Or endgame studies? By dissecting the games of great tacticians?\n\nFew books present a structured approach to tactics, so this book fills a valuable niche in the ambitious player's library. The authors present each major tactical theme in turn, explaining how it works and providing inspiring examples. They then explain how you can spot the idea in your own games and use it to your advantage. You immediately get a chance to put your knowledge to the test, as there are challenging exercises throughout the whole book, with detailed solutions.\n\nThe second part of the book offers more advanced material, and takes us inside the professional's tactics laboratory. Here we see how tactical themes are combined, and employed to achieve strategic goals. We are also shown how grandmasters spot the targets for their breathtaking combinations, which we thus come to see not as sheer witchcraft, but as the product of disciplined thought and training.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Course-Chess-Tactics-Dejan-Bojkov/dp/1906454140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327262751&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Course-Chess-Tactics-Dejan-Bojkov/dp/1906454140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327262751&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54a3064c94d44bc553142521621bcc8b2e1e9241","amp;dn":"A+Course+in+Chess+Tactics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54a3064c94d44bc553142521621bcc8b2e1e9241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,163,6,76,148,212,75,197,83,20,37,33,98,27,204,139,46,30,146,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
