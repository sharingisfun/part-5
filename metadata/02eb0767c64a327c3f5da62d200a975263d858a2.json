These contained gardens are more manageable than long rows or plots and require much less work--yet yield just as much bounty.\n\nFeaturing dozens of preplanned planting recipes, based on space or container sizes, Edible Spots and Pots allows readers to mix and match vegetables, herbs, small fruits, and edible flowers to create a plant-style patchwork based on the &quot;thriller&quot; (dramatic, focal-point plants), &quot;filler&quot; (midheight, bushy plants), and &quot;spiller&quot; (vines and twining plants) formula for creating interesting and botanically sound gardens. Plot-free gardening offers practical solutions for any circumstance a gardener may encounter (challenging spaces, soils, or weather), while also taking into account budget, time, and aesthetic goals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02eb0767c64a327c3f5da62d200a975263d858a2","amp;dn":"Edible+Spots+and+Pots%3A+Small-Space+Gardens+for+Growing+Vegetable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02eb0767c64a327c3f5da62d200a975263d858a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,235,7,103,198,74,50,124,63,93,166,45,32,10,151,82,99,216,88,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
