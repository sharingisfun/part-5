That being said it is not a book for the casual reader. Panofsky does not insult your intelligence but expects you to think. This book would be an excellent addition, indeed an mandatory one, for any library of history. I would also recommend this book to anyone studying the 12th-13th centuries. I have read and re-read this book again and again soaking up Panofsky's prose and relishing his intensity of thought regarding a shadowy period in our history. It is a mindopener to the mystery of why gothic architecture looks like it does    AMAZON\n\nProfessor Erwin Panofsky's study, Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism, captured and holds an eminent place in a series that is not without distinction, the Wimmer Lectures. Established in memory of the founder of the Benedictine Order in America, Boniface Wimmer, the series has brought to St. Vincent College such fine scholars as Jacques Maritain (Man's Approach to God&quot;), William F. Albright (&quot;Toward a Theistic Humanism&quot;), Helen C. White (&quot;Prayer and Poetry&quot;), and Elias A. Lowe (&quot;The Finest Book in the World&quot;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:238f3b35a5045967e27e68fad1b2a14eb6f46bfd","amp;dn":"Gothic+Architecture+and+Scholasticism+by+Erwin+Panofsky+%28Art+Ebo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"238f3b35a5045967e27e68fad1b2a14eb6f46bfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,143,59,53,165,4,89,103,226,126,104,250,209,178,161,78,182,244,107,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
