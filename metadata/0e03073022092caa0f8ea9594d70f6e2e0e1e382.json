The combined talents of Goldwyn, director King Vidor and star Barbara Stanwyck lift this property far above the level of mere soap opera. Stanwyck is perfectly cast as Stella Martin, the loud, vulgar factory-town girl who snares wealthy husband Stephen Dallas (John Boles). When Stephen is offered a job in New York, Stella stays behind, knowing that she'll never be part of her husband's social circle. She pals around platonically with her old beau, the cheap and tasteless Ed Munn (Alan Hale), a fact that drives yet another wedge between Stella and her husband. The final straw is daughter Laurel's (Anne Shirley) birthday party, which is boycotted by the local bluenoses. Though she would like to remain part of her daughter's life, Stella knows that she and she alone is the reason that Laurel is shunned by the rest of the community.\n\nRip Specs (HD-TV Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Stella Dallas.1937.720p.HDTVx264.AC3-DMMD.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 4 994 Kbps\nLength            : 3.69 GiB for 1h 45mn 42s 912ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 4 510 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nAudio #1          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029608/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029608/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English or Spanish\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e03073022092caa0f8ea9594d70f6e2e0e1e382","amp;dn":"Stella+Dallas.1937.720p.HDTVx264.AC3-DMMD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e03073022092caa0f8ea9594d70f6e2e0e1e382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,3,7,48,34,9,44,170,15,142,169,89,77,112,246,226,224,225,227,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
