We seek out information that supports us and downplay information that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. We get distracted by short-term emotions. When it comes to making choices, it seems, our brains are flawed instruments. Unfortunately, merely being aware of these shortcomings doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix the problem, any more than knowing that we are nearsighted helps us to see. The real question is: How can we do better?\n\n\nIn Decisive, the Heaths, based on an exhaustive study of the decision-making literature, introduce a four-step process designed to counteract these biases. Written in an engaging and compulsively readable style, Decisive takes readers on an unforgettable journey, from a rock starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ingenious decision-making trick to a CEOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disastrous acquisition, to a single question that can often resolve thorny personal decisions.\n\nAlong the way, we learn the answers to critical questions like these: How can we stop the cycle of agonizing over our decisions? How can we make group decisions without destructive politics? And how can we ensure that we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t overlook precious opportunities to change our course??\n\nDecisive is the Heath brothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most powerfulÃ¢â‚¬â€and importantÃ¢â‚¬â€book yet, offering fresh strategies and practical tools enabling us to make better choices. Because the right decision, at the right moment, can make all the difference.
