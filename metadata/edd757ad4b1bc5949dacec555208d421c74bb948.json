Their music, built around radiant harmonies and a solid electric folk foundation, was gorgeous on its own terms, but a major part of its appeal lay in the easygoing southern California lifestyle it endorsed. The group's success was as extraordinary as it was brief, and onlookers may well wonder what went wrong with a performing group that seemed to have the world at its feet for all of two years. The irony behind the Mamas &amp; the Papas' story is that the same forces that made it possible for them to create extraordinary music together also made it impossible for them to stay together for more than a short time. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.85% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tMCA\nCatalogue #\t\tMCAD-11740\t\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.California Dreamin'\n02.Go Where You Wanna Go\n03.Monday, Monday\n04.I Call Your Name\n05.Do You Wanna Dance\n06.I Saw Her Again\n07.You Baby\n08.Dancing Bear\n09.Words Of Love\n10.No Salt On Her Tail\n11.Look Through My Window\n12.Dancing In The Street\n13.Dedicated To The One I Love\n14.Creeque Alley\n15.Glad To Be Unhappy\n16.Twist And Shout\n17.Twelve-Thirty (Young Girls Are Coming To The Canyon)\n18.My Girl\n19.Safe In My Garden\n20.Dream A Little Dream Of Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           \n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edd757ad4b1bc5949dacec555208d421c74bb948","amp;dn":"The+Mamas+And+The+Papas+-+Greatest+Hits+%281998%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edd757ad4b1bc5949dacec555208d421c74bb948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,215,87,173,75,27,197,148,157,172,236,85,82,8,212,33,199,75,185,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
