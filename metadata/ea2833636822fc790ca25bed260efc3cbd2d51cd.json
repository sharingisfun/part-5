The SHAHMEN sound is a dance between moments of pure tonal bliss and dark, hard, banging beats.\n\nImagine, SENSE (of The Q4) as the mystical, more musically composed student of Muggs and RZA , who learned a secret his teachers did not. Building from their foundation, he reaches new plateaus in the dimensionality of sample composition. Finding his own, unique formula for interweaving haunting melodies between head banging drums, the music pulls you into a trance like state where the rock solid voice of B L S finds the perfect soundscape to sink in. \n\nTrack listing:\n1 Dirt\n2 Shell Dweller (ft Unorthadox)\n3 Abacus\n4 Mark\n5 Van Gogh's Crows\n6 1981985 Pt. l (ft Unorthadox)\n7 World of Wils Pt. l","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2833636822fc790ca25bed260efc3cbd2d51cd","amp;dn":"Shahmen+-+Enter+The+Circle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2833636822fc790ca25bed260efc3cbd2d51cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,40,51,99,104,34,252,121,12,162,91,237,38,14,252,60,189,45,81,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
