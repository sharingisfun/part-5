Wilson is co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, a man included in TIME Magazine's &quot;100 Persons of the 20th Century.&quot; Interviews, recreations, and rare archival material reveal how Bill Wilson, a hopeless drunk near death from his alcoholism, found a way out of his own addiction and then forged a path for countless others to follow. With Bill as its driving force, A.A. grew from a handful of men to a worldwide fellowship of over 2 million men and women - a success that made him an icon within A.A., but also an alcoholic unable to be a member of the very society he had created. A reluctant hero, Bill Wilson lived a life of sacrifice and service, and left a legacy that continues every day, all around the world. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2275549/?ref_=sr_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2275549/?ref_=sr_2&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b02a329e2aaadbe2802ed2f88ab80205491508","amp;dn":"Bill+W%2C+Documentary+2112","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23b02a329e2aaadbe2802ed2f88ab80205491508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,176,42,50,158,42,170,219,226,128,46,210,248,138,184,2,5,73,21,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
