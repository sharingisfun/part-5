Programmers of other languages who are interested in Python can also benefit from this book, but it would be better if they first read some introductory materials that explain how things are done in Python.\r\n\r\nWhat You Will Learn\r\n\r\nExplore Factory Method and Abstract Factory for object creation\r\nClone objects using the Prototype pattern\r\nMake incompatible interfaces compatible using the Adapter pattern\r\nSecure an interface using the Proxy pattern\r\nChoose an algorithm dynamically using the Strategy pattern\r\nExtend an object without subclassing using the Decorator pattern\r\nKeep the logic decoupled from the UI using the MVC pattern\r\n\r\nIn Detail\r\n\r\nPython is an object-oriented, scripting language that is used in wide range of categories. In software engineering, a design pattern is a recommended solution to a software design problem. Although not new, design patterns remain one of the hottest topics in software engineering and they come as a ready reference for software developers to solve the common problems they face at work.\r\n\r\nThis book will take you through each and every design pattern explained with the help of real-world examples. The aim of the book is to introduce more low-level detail and concepts on how to write Pythonic code, not just focusing on common solutions as implemented in Java and C++. It includes small sections on troubleshooting, best practices, system architecture, and its design aspects. With the help of this book, you will be able to understand Python design pattern concepts and the framework, as well as issues and their resolution. You'll focus on all 16 design patterns that are used to solve everyday problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7909bdced889886accf281bf652f653c12807c0","amp;dn":"Mastering+Python+Design+Patterns+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7909bdced889886accf281bf652f653c12807c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,144,155,220,237,136,152,134,172,207,40,27,246,82,246,83,193,40,7,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
