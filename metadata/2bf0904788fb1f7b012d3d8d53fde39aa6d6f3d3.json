Internet-enabled contact lenses. Cars that fly by floating on magnetic fields. This is the stuff of science fictionÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also daily life in the year 2100.\n\nRenowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku details the developments in computer technology, artificial intelligence, medicine, space travel, and more, that are poised to happen over the next hundred years. He also considers how these inventions will affect the world economy, addressing the key questions: Who will have jobs? Which nations will prosper? Kaku interviews three hundred of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top scientistsÃ¢â‚¬â€working in their labs on astonishing prototypes. He also takes into account the rigorous scientific principles that regulate how quickly, how safely, and how far technologies can advance. In Physics of the Future, Kaku forecasts a century of earthshaking advances in technology that could make even the last centuriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ leaps and bounds seem insignificant.
