More recently he has focused on producing and promoting world music and pioneering digital distribution methods for music. He has also been involved in various humanitarian efforts. Gabriel was awarded the Polar Music Prize in 2009. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI (Car) 1977\n\n\nPeter Gabriel is the first album Peter Gabriel recorded after leaving the progressive rock band Genesis, and the first of four with the same eponymous title. Upon the album's release, Gabriel began touring with a seven-piece band under his own name.\n\nGabriel and producer Bob Ezrin assembled a team of talented musicians, including Robert Fripp of King Crimson, to record the album.\n\nThe album's second track, &quot;Solsbury Hill,&quot; describes Gabriel's departure from Genesis and has become one of Gabriel's more popular songs. Erasure covered the song in 2003 on Other People's Songs.\n\nAfter release, Peter Gabriel felt that the track &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot; was over-produced. Since then he has created far simpler renditions such as the one on Robert Fripp's album, Exposure, his appearance on Kate Bush's 1979 TV special, and yet a third version on Peter Gabriel's first greatest hits album, Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats. He often performs the song live accompanied by only himself on keyboard. [1]\n\nThe album went to #7 in UK and #38 in the USA.\n\nThis album is often referred to as Car, or Rain, referring to the album cover by Peter Christopherson, aka, Sleazy from Hipgnosis. The car was a Lancia Flavia owned by Storm Thorgerson. [2]\n\nThere is a slightly different version of this album released through Direct Disk Labs, a halfspeed mastered version from the original master tapes. It has a longer version of &quot;Slowburn&quot; (5:16 instead of 4:36) with the song's introduction intact. All other versions of the song seem to have this intro edited out. Normally the song starts with a piano, but this rare version begins with a full band.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Moribund the Burgermeister&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n2.\t&quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n3.\t&quot;Modern Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n4.\t&quot;Excuse Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 (Gabriel, Martin Hall)\n5.\t&quot;Humdrum&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n6.\t&quot;Slowburn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n7.\t&quot;Waiting for the Big One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:15\n8.\t&quot;Down the Dolce Vita&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n9.\t&quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII (Scratch) 1978\n\n\nPeter Gabriel is the second solo album by the British singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel, released in 1978. The album is the second of four with the same eponymous title. Guitarist Robert Fripp served as producer, whose influence on the album is evident in the use of Frippertronics on the track &quot;Exposure.&quot; The album did not sell as well as the first Peter Gabriel, but reached #10 on the UK charts.[1] &quot;Mother of Violence&quot; was written by Peter and his first wife Jill Gabriel.\n\nThis album is often[citation needed] referred to as Scratch, referring to the album cover by Hipgnosis.\n\nThis album was originally intended as part of a loose trilogy with Robert Fripp's Exposure and Daryl Hall's Sacred Songs.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;On the Air&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30\n2.\t&quot;D.I.Y.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n3.\t&quot;Mother of Violence&quot; (Peter Gabriel, Jill Gabriel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n4.\t&quot;A Wonderful Day in a One-Way World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n5.\t&quot;White Shadow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14*\n6.\t&quot;Indigo&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n7.\t&quot;Animal Magic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n8.\t&quot;Exposure&quot; (Peter Gabriel, Robert Fripp) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n9.\t&quot;Flotsam and Jetsam&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n10.\t&quot;Perspective&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23+\n11.\t&quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII (Melt) 1980\n\n\n\nPeter Gabriel is Peter Gabriel's third album. The album contains two of Gabriel's most famous songs, the U.K. Top 10 hit &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; and the political song &quot;Biko&quot;, about the late anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. The album was remastered, along with most of Gabriel's catalog, in 2002.\n\nThis album is often referred to as Melt due to its cover photograph by Hipgnosis. The photo was taken with a Polaroid SX-70 instant camera, and subsequently modified by Storm Thorgerson or Gabriel. (Thorgerson does not recall whether he or Gabriel manipulated the image.)\n\nThe album, produced by Gabriel and Steve Lillywhite, was Gabriel's first and only release for Mercury Records in the U.S., after being rejected by Atlantic Records, who handled U.S. distribution for Gabriel's first two solo albums and his last two albums with Genesis. Upon hearing mixes of the album's session tapes in early 1980, Atlantic A&amp;R executive John Kalodner deemed the album not commercial enough for release, and recommended that Atlantic drop Gabriel from their artist roster. By the time the album was released by Mercury several months later, Kalodner, now working for the newly-formed Geffen Records label and having realized his mistake, arranged for Geffen to pursue Gabriel as one of their first artist signings.[1] Geffen re-issued the album in 1983 after Mercury's distribution rights to the album lapsed, and has marketed it in the U.S. since.\n\nGabriel's ex-Genesis bandmate Phil Collins, who succeeded Gabriel as Genesis' lead vocalist, plays drums and provides backing vocals on several of the album's tracks. In particular, Collins played drums on &quot;Intruder&quot;, which has been cited as the first use of Collins' &quot;gated drum&quot; sound. This effect, as created by Lillywhite, Collins and Hugh Padgham,[2] was featured on Collins' recordings throughout the 1980s. The distinctive sound was identified via experiments by Lillywhite, Collins and Padgham, in response to Gabriel's request that Collins and Jerry Marotta not use cymbals on the album's sessions. The sound was significant enough and influential enough that it has been claimed by Gabriel, Padgham, Collins, and Lillywhite. The drum sound on this album has been noted by Public Image Ltd as influencing the sound on their album Flowers of Romance,[3] whose engineer, Nick Launay, was in turn employed by Collins to assist him with his first solo album, Face Value\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Intruder&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n2.\t&quot;No Self Control&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n3.\t&quot;Start&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:21\n4.\t&quot;I Don't Remember&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n5.\t&quot;Family Snapshot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n6.\t&quot;And Through the Wire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n7.\t&quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n8.\t&quot;Not One of Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22\n9.\t&quot;Lead a Normal Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n10.\t&quot;Biko&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV (Security) 1982\n\n\nPeter Gabriel is the fourth album released by the British progressive rock musician Peter Gabriel. This album was originally released as GabrielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fourth eponymous album, but was released in the United States as Security, Gabriel's first album with Geffen Records in the US and Canada.\n\nThis album is an early full digital recording. Its instrumentation is mostly electronic with extensive sampling (through use of the then-new Fairlight CMI) and percussion. It was recorded at Gabriel's then-home, Ashcombe House in Somerset, England in 1981.[1] It was remastered with most of Gabriel's catalogue in 2002.\n\nThe songs on the album cover a wide variety of subject matter. &quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot; is based on Carl JungÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experience while observing a group of African drummers. &quot;San Jacinto&quot; reflects on the fear and pain experienced by a Native American man who sees his culture overwhelmed by modern white society. &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;, a meditation on jealousy, uses imagery of a primate to describe personal anxieties. &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; deals with a theme of healing, through trust, which is further explored on later albums. &quot;The Family and the Fishing Net&quot; is a song comparing a modern day wedding to a voodoo sacrifice. &quot;Wallflower&quot; is about the treatment of political prisoners in Latin America during the 1980s.[1]\n\n&quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; was featured on the 1987 film, Project X, starring Matthew Broderick. &quot;Wallflower&quot; was featured on the 1984 film Birdy, directed by Alan Parker and starring Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage. &quot;I Have The Touch&quot; featured in the 1988 film, The Chocolate War; an alternate version of &quot;I Have the Touch&quot; was featured on the 1996 film, Phenomenon, starring John Travolta, and a cover version by Heather Nova was featured in The Craft. &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; was also featured in episode 110 of the animated series South Park.\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n2.\t&quot;San Jacinto&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:21\n3.\t&quot;I Have the Touch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n4.\t&quot;The Family and the Fishing Net&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:00\n5.\t&quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:23\n6.\t&quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n7.\t&quot;Wallflower&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:30\n8.\t&quot;Kiss of Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlays Live 1983\n\n\nPlays Live is the first live and fifth album overall released by British rock musician Peter Gabriel. This album was originally released as a double album and longplay cassette, with sixteen songs and a running time of over 80 minutes. It was eventually issued as a double CD set, and, in 1985, as a single CD version Plays Live ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Highlights with only twelve songs and some significant track time alterations. It was remastered and reissued in 2002, the Highlights version was released in the US while the full double-CD set, containing all the songs, was released in the UK.\n\nThe album's one previously unreleased song, &quot;I Go Swimming,&quot; received airplay and made the US charts in 1983. (The song was initially performed by Gabriel during his 1980 world tour, in support of his third album). &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; was issued as a single, with an accompanying music video, in the US as well.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:26\n2.\t&quot;I Have the Touch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n3.\t&quot;Not One of Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n4.\t&quot;Family Snapshot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n5.\t&quot;D.I.Y.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n6.\t&quot;The Family and the Fishing Net&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:22\n7.\t&quot;Intruder&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n8.\t&quot;I Go Swimming&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;San Jacinto&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:28\n2.\t&quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n3.\t&quot;No Self Control&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n4.\t&quot;I Don't Remember&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n5.\t&quot;Shock The Monkey&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:40\n6.\t&quot;Humdrum&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n7.\t&quot;On the Air&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:20\n8.\t&quot;Biko&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdy 1985\n\n\nBirdy is the first soundtrack and sixth album overall by British rock musician Peter Gabriel, for the movie of the same name, released in 1985 (see 1985 in music). The album marked Gabriel's first work with producer Daniel Lanois. It was remastered with most of Gabriel's catalogue in 2002.\n\nIn addition to composing new pieces for the soundtrack, Gabriel also used instrumental themes and sections from earlier works to form the basis of some tracks. There were, however, no songs with lyrics on the album.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;At Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n2.\t&quot;Floating Dogs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n3.\t&quot;Quiet and Alone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n4.\t&quot;Close Up&quot; (from &quot;Family Snapshot&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:55\n5.\t&quot;Slow Water&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n6.\t&quot;Dressing the Wound&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n7.\t&quot;Birdy's Flight&quot; (from &quot;Not One of Us&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n8.\t&quot;Slow Marimbas&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n9.\t&quot;The Heat&quot; (from &quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n10.\t&quot;Sketch Pad With Trumpet and Voice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n11.\t&quot;Under Lock and Key&quot; (from &quot;Wallflower&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:28\n12.\t&quot;Powerhouse at the Foot of the Mountain&quot; (from &quot;San Jacinto&quot;) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo 1986\n\n\nSo is the fifth studio album (and seventh album overall) by British rock musician Peter Gabriel, released in 1986. Many of its songs reflect a more conventional pop-writing style and became radio hits, others still retain Gabriel's dark, brooding sense of experimentalism.\n\nIt is Peter Gabriel's second album produced by Canadian artist Daniel Lanois. The previous year, the two of them had worked together on Birdy. Lanois had been previously known for his ambient collaborations with Brian Eno as well as producing U2 since 1984. As he had with the soundtrack to the film Birdy, Lanois brought many of his own ambient sensibilities to this recording.\n\nThe album begins with &quot;Red Rain&quot;. Inspired by a recurring dream which Gabriel had of swimming in a sea of red water, its lyrics vividly depict dream imagery that reflect a sense of vulnerability. The song is one of the works in the story of Mozo, a wandering stranger who appears in several Gabriel songs. Of all the tracks on the album, Gabriel considers &quot;Red Rain&quot; one of his favourites.[1] Other Mozo works include &quot;On the Air&quot; and &quot;Exposure&quot;.\n\nThe second track is Gabriel's most popular single, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;. &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; is a piece with Motown and world music influences, from its famous use of the shakuhachi. The video for &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; won MTV's 1987 Top Music Video Award. Directed by Steven Johnson, it features stop motion animation by Aardman Animations of Wallace and Gromit fame. The dancing chickens were animated by Nick Park. The video ends with Gabriel dancing in silhouette, covered with lights taped on his suit by a runner who later became a producer for the Wallace and Gromit films. While performing the song on his 2002 tour, Gabriel recreated this image by wearing a jacket covered with LED lights.\n\nTracks 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“6 include a duet with Kate Bush titled &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;, &quot;That Voice Again&quot;, and hit single &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;. &quot;Mercy Street&quot; is dedicated to poet Anne Sexton and takes its title from her 1969 play, Mercy Street (Sexton also posthumously released a book of poetry, 45 Mercy Street). &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; was used in the famed boombox scene from the film Say Anything... (1989).\n\nTrack 7 is &quot;Big Time&quot;. This song is a send-up of the narcissism of the 1980s and was also accompanied by a video in the same vein of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, although to less popularity. The next track is titled &quot;We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)&quot;. The title refers to the 37 out of 40 compliant subjects of Milgram Experiment 18.\n\nThe album ends with &quot;This Is the Picture (Excellent Birds)&quot;. This song features vocals with co-writer Laurie Anderson. This track is not included on the original vinyl release of the album, but was added to the audio cassette and CD editions. Anderson had previously recorded a different arrangement of the song entitled &quot;Excellent Birds&quot; for her 1984 album, Mister Heartbreak, which also featured vocals by Gabriel. A video rendition of the song featuring Anderson and Gabriel was included in the 1 January 1984 TV satellite broadcast Good Morning, Mr. Orwell. Anderson also performs the song in her concert film Home of the Brave, released around the same time as So.\n\nThis was Gabriel's first studio album to bear an official title from its inception. His previous regular albums were simply titled &quot;Peter Gabriel,&quot; including 1982's Security, which was retitled by Gabriel's US label at the time, Geffen Records. It had been speculated that the album was named for the fifth note on the scale(do-re-mi-fa-SO), signifying that it was Gabriel's fifth solo album. However, the fifth note of the scale is actually SOL, and according to Peter Gabriel himself, the title did not have any meaning. &quot;It doesn't mean anything&quot;, he said in an interview with Smash Hits in 1986.[cite this quote] &quot;We just liked the form of the word and the two letters. That's all.&quot;\n\n\nWhen the album was remastered in 2002 with most of Gabriel's catalogue, the song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; was moved from the fifth song to the ninth song. This was what Peter Gabriel originally intended, but because of the limitations of the vinyl release format it was moved up to be the first track on side two. Oddly, the credits in the booklet were not changed to show the change in order (so, Youssou N'Dour, instead of being credited with backing vocals to &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; is given credit for backing vocals on &quot;Mercy Street&quot;).\n\nThe songs Red Rain, Sledgehammer, Don't Give Up, Mercy Street, and We Do What We're Told were featured in episodes of the T.V series Miami Vice.\n\nIn 1998, Q magazine readers voted So the 81st greatest album of all time. In 2001, the TV network VH1 placed it at number 91. Rolling Stone magazine places the album at 187 on its list of 500 greatest albums of all time [2] and #14 in Rolling Stone's 100 Best Albums of The 80's survey.[3] It was also included in College Music Journal's list of &quot;Top 25 College Radio Albums of All Time&quot; [4] and ranked #1 in CMJ's &quot;Top 20 Most-Played Albums of 1986&quot;.[5] The album came fifth in Kerrang! magazine's Albums Of The Year 1986.\n\nThe success of the album earned Peter Gabriel two awards at The Brit Awards in 1987: Best British Male Solo Artist and Best British Video for &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Red Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n2.\t&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n3.\t&quot;Don't Give Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:33\n4.\t&quot;That Voice Again&quot; (Gabriel, David Rhodes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n5.\t&quot;In Your Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n6.\t&quot;Mercy Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:22\n7.\t&quot;Big Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n8.\t&quot;We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n9.\t&quot;This Is the Picture (Excellent Birds)&quot; (Laurie Anderson, Gabriel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n\n\n\n\nPassion 1989\n\n\nPassion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ is a musical album released in 1989 by Peter Gabriel. It is his second soundtrack and eighth album overall. It was originally composed as the soundtrack for the film The Last Temptation of Christ, but Gabriel spent several months after the film's release further developing the music, finally releasing it as a full-fledged album instead of a &quot;movie soundtrack&quot;. It is seen as a landmark in the popularisation of world music, and it won a Grammy in 1990 for Best New Age Album. It was remastered with most of Gabriel's catalogue in 2002.\n\n\nAs the soundtrack for the film, Gabriel used the resources of the organisation he founded, WOMAD, to bring together musicians from the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. He worked with them to create music meant to enhance the mood of the film, but also added a modern ambient musical touch to the original pieces, producing a musical work that has influenced many musicians in the years since its release. Passion introduced many listeners to such artists as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Youssou N'Dour, L. Shankar, and Baaba Maal.\n\nLater in the year a companion album was released, Passion - Sources, featuring additional songs on which Gabriel does not perform. Gabriel described this album as &quot;a selection of some of the traditional music, sources of inspiration, and location recordings.&quot;\n\nThe cover art for the album, Drawing study for Self Image II (1987), is a mixed media composition by the artist Julian Grater.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Feeling Begins&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n2.\t&quot;Gethsemane&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:26\n3.\t&quot;Of These, Hope&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n4.\t&quot;Lazarus Raised&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:26\n5.\t&quot;Of These, Hope - Reprise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44           \n6.\t&quot;In Doubt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:33\n7.\t&quot;A Different Drum&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n8.\t&quot;Zaar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n9.\t&quot;Troubled&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n10.\t&quot;Open&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n11.\t&quot;Before Night Falls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n12.\t&quot;With This Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n13.\t&quot;Sandstorm&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n14.\t&quot;Stigmata&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:28\n15.\t&quot;Passion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:39\n16.\t&quot;With This Love - Choir&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n17.\t&quot;Wall Of Breath&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n18.\t&quot;The Promise of Shadows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:13\n19.\t&quot;Disturbed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n20.\t&quot;It Is Accomplished&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n21.\t&quot;Bread and Wine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUs  1992\n\n\nUs is the sixth studio album (and ninth album overall) by British rock musician Peter Gabriel, originally released in 1992. It was remastered, with most of Gabriel's catalogue, in 2002. Singles taken from the album included &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot;, &quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;Blood of Eden&quot; (previously featured in the 1991 Wim Wenders film Until the End of the World), and &quot;Kiss That Frog&quot;.\n\nOn this album Gabriel explored the pain of recent personal problems; his failed first marriage, his relationship with Rosanna Arquette, and the growing distance between him and his first daughter.\n\nThe album was supported by the &quot;Secret World Live&quot; tour, named after its ultimate track, &quot;Secret World&quot;. The tour spawned a live album and a concert film. The album was also promoted through a first-of-its-kind interactive multimedia software released for Macintosh computers called Xplora1: Peter Gabriel's Secret World, which featured several music videos from the album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Come Talk to Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:06\n2.\t&quot;Love to Be Loved&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n3.\t&quot;Blood of Eden&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:38\n4.\t&quot;Steam&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n5.\t&quot;Only Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:30\n6.\t&quot;Washing of the Water&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n7.\t&quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n8.\t&quot;Fourteen Black Paintings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n9.\t&quot;Kiss That Frog&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:20\n10.\t&quot;Secret World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVO 2000\n\n\nOVO is the soundtrack to the Millennium Dome Show in London that was composed by Peter Gabriel. It was released on 29 August 2000 and features guest vocals by Neneh Cherry, Rosco, Richie Havens, Elizabeth Fraser and Paul Buchanan (of The Blue Nile). Two versions of the album were released, a limited edition version, which was only released in the United Kingdom, and a standard international version. The UK limited edition version was discontinued after its initial 2000 pressing and replaced with the standard international version. Some pressings of the UK limited edition version contained a booklet with a comic book telling the OVO story and a bonus CD with the bonus track, &quot;The Story of OVO&quot;.\n\nGabriel performed &quot;Father, Son&quot;, &quot;The Tower That Ate People&quot;, &quot;White Ashes&quot;, and &quot;Downside Up&quot; over the course of the Growing Up and Still Growing Up tours. Melanie Gabriel provided backing vocals for &quot;Downside Up&quot;. These performances are available on the Growing Up Live and Still Growing Up: Live &amp; Unwrapped DVDs. &quot;Downside-Up&quot; and &quot;The Nest That Sailed The Sky&quot; were performed as part of The New Blood Tour in 2010, the former as a duet between Peter and Melanie Gabriel and the latter as the closing, orchestra-only track of the show.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Story of OVO&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n2.\t&quot;Low Light&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:37\n3.\t&quot;The Time of the Turning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n4.\t&quot;The Man Who Loved the Earth/The Hand That Sold Shadows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n5.\t&quot;The Time of the Turning (Reprise)/The Weaver's Reel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n6.\t&quot;Father, Son&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n7.\t&quot;The Tower That Ate People&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n8.\t&quot;Revenge&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:31\n9.\t&quot;White Ashes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n10.\t&quot;Downside-Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:04\n11.\t&quot;The Nest That Sailed the Sky&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n12.\t&quot;Make Tomorrow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:01\n\n\n\n\nUp  2002\n\n\nUp (2002) is the seventh studio and 13th album overall released by the British progressive rock musician Peter Gabriel.\n\n\nIn the Spring of 1995, Gabriel began work on the album. Its name was Up from the start, though at one point it was considered to be called I/O. Gabriel began saying the album was near completion somewhere around 1998 but did not release it until September 2002. In the months preceding the album's release, video clips of Gabriel talking about the songs as well as short demos of each song were released at the coming of every full moon on Gabriel's official website.\n\n\nThe album's lyrics deal mostly with birth and especially death. The opening track, &quot;Darkness&quot;, is a song about overcoming fears. &quot;Growing Up&quot; is a summation of life put to a pulsating beat. &quot;Sky Blue&quot; is a track Gabriel claimed to have been working on for 10 years before finishing it. The track &quot;No Way Out&quot; is the first track to deal with death solely, though death is a common theme across the entire album. &quot;I Grieve&quot; was conceived after Gabriel looked over his catalogue of music as if it were a catalogue of emotional tools. He found one major missing tool to be one to cope with death and therefore &quot;I Grieve&quot; was born (first aired in 1998, despite the popular belief that it was written in response to 9/11). The first single from Up, &quot;The Barry Williams Show&quot; is a down-beat, jazzy song dealing with reality talk shows such as Jerry Springer (in fact, Barry Williams appeared as an audience member in the Sean Penn-directed music video for the song). The second single, &quot;More Than This&quot; is one of the more upbeat songs from the album. The song wonders over there being something more to life. The song &quot;Signal to Noise&quot; was a challenge for Gabriel because the guest vocalist for the track, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, died. All that was left to work with were recordings from a live performance of an early version of the song at the VH1 Witness show on April 28, 1996. Finally, &quot;The Drop&quot; consists of only Gabriel and a BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶sendorfer grand piano.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Darkness&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:51\n2.\t&quot;Growing Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:33\n3.\t&quot;Sky Blue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:37\n4.\t&quot;No Way Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:53\n5.\t&quot;I Grieve&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:25\n6.\t&quot;The Barry Williams Show&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:16\n7.\t&quot;My Head Sounds Like That&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:29\n8.\t&quot;More Than This&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:02\n9.\t&quot;Signal to Noise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:36\n10.\t&quot;The Drop&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong Walk Home 2002\n\n\n\nLong Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence is the third soundtrack and twelfth album overall released by the British musician Peter Gabriel.

In all honesty I was never that much of a Peter Gabriel fan. I guess it stems from his days with Genesis and my reaction to that band. In general I saw them as far too much of an upper-class private-school educated exercise in pretentious wankery to be bothered with them too much. Gabriel was intimately associated with the Genesis I disliked and so when he went solo my dislike of the band rubbed off on his solo career. As a result I never bothered to explore much of GabrielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solo work and never looked beyond whatever songs occasionally cropped up on mainstream radio. I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel I needed to. \n\n\nTo be fair, it was not all negative. I loved ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSledgehammerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ when it came out, if only because of that iconic video which went with it which I regarded then, and still do, as the most original and innovative music video ever made. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSolsbury HillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was also pleasant enough but neither song was hardly the sort of thing which would get me to start out of my chair and rush down to the local record store to purchase a copy. But generally, the rest of his music passed me by. I never bought into this WOMAD business, finding it a bit too patronising (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œworld musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ needs saving! Call for Gabrielman, the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only musical superhero). \n\n\nSo what am I doing reviewing this then? Well, it is simple. It came free with the Sunday Mail, a notorious right-wing rabble-rousing newspaper here in the UK notorious for making news out of petty incidents of bad behaviour by their pet hate figures ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Muslims, immigrants, single mothers, binmen and speed cameras. Normally, I would not touch it with a bargepole. So, as is the case with other freebies I have, I bought the newspaper, extracted the free CD and threw the newspaper away. I may not be a great fan of Peter Gabriel but even I can stretch to Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£1.20 for a CD. And so here it is. \n\n\nAnd yes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSledgehammerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is here, a live version to boot. Same with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSolsbury HillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ so it seems that his two most recognisable tracks are drawn from live performances on this disk and four of them in total are included here. As for the rest, well some are worth listening to and others are worth avoiding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFather, SonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is so excessively maudlin it frankly makes me what to vomit. But in summation, there is a good sixty minutes worth of effectively free music here. The cover is unique, and is a sort of sponsored artwork, with all the profits from it going to some cause or other that Gabriel is promoting (though it does look perilously close to those irritating cloth puppets in the Vauxhall Corsa ad doing the rounds at the moment). \n\n\nDoes all this change my perception of Peter Gabriel? Not really. The music here is listenable without actually stirring the soul. In that sense it is better than Genesis, but I would not have bought this if it were not free with a newspaper. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSledgehammerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a great foot tapper and that is about it. Much of it is background music which rarely holds your attention. You get the occasional flash of what sounds like an African inspired rhythm section in deference to the concept of WOMAD. But at the end of the day, there is still just too much public school wankery to give it a higher rating than the two and half stars I have accorded it.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nFather, Son\nThe Tower That Ate People (Remix)\nOf These, Hope\nThe Rhythm of the Heat\nNo Self Control\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Break This Rhythm\nI Grieve\nSecret World\nI Have the Touch (Robbie Robertson Remix)\nRed Rain\nSolsbury Hill (live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScratch My Back 2010\n\n\nScratch My Back is the eighth studio album by the English musician Peter Gabriel, his first in eight years.
