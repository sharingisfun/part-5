Sportes played Rockabilly in the 80's with Eduardo Leal de la Gala, (Wreckless Eric/Ltno) and Kantorovwicz Trash, but they play a melt of genres in their album: dub, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and also Brazilian music. The band have worked from samples with an Akai S 2000 on their tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:045ad5f8883e36bf7d4f5f6d981e4dc22f65a098","amp;dn":"Sporto+Kantes+-+4+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"045ad5f8883e36bf7d4f5f6d981e4dc22f65a098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,90,213,248,136,62,54,191,125,79,95,109,152,30,77,194,47,101,160,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
