Reflecting the artistic expression of an isolated civilization, the works of Hokusai, one of the first Japanese artists to emerge in Europe, greatly influenced Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters, such as Vincent van Gogh. Hokusai fascinates with the variety and the significance of his work which spanned almost ninety years.
