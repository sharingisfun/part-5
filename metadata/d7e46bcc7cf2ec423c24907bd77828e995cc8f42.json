These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, to output to a t.v. or such, then this may be for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch LCD/surround sound system.\n\n--------------------------\nTHE LOST ROOM - MINISERIES\n--------------------------\nEpisodes 1-6\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nQuality: 18.5 crf (Constant Rate Factor)\n(For a good explanation of CRF vs Target File Size see: http://mod16.org/hurfdurf/?p=175 and http://animestash.info/forum/index.php?topic=20342.0\nEncoding video with x264, there are two basic ways to choose how big the file will be: 1. You pick an average size (in bits) per second or 2. You pick an average quality (crf). #1 lets you predict how big the file will be, but the quality is unpredictable, while #2 lets you predict the average quality but not the filesize, since thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no easy way to predict in advance how much space the encoder needs to achieve the desired quality. Some scenes/videos need more bits, some need less.  The standard 350mb encoding that you see doesn't take any of this into account, so the quality can be sub-par and can vary greatly across files. The files in this torrent are all encoded at a constant quality crf of 18.5 which is a very high quality factor.  You'll notice many &quot;scene release&quot; tv shows and movies vary in size.  That's because they're using CRF. 350mb/700mb encoding is dead. CRF encoding is the future of encoding. \n\nContainer: MKV\nVideo: x264\nResolution: 720 x 480 (16:9 widescreen) (Loose Anamorphic 853 x 480) \n\nAudio: English, 5.1 Channel Dolby AC3\n\nSubtitles: English subrip srt in MKV. (note: you can turn subs on or off)\n\nHope you enjoy!!\n\nPlease seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded (1 to 1 ratio)...thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7e46bcc7cf2ec423c24907bd77828e995cc8f42","amp;dn":"The.Lost..Room..DVDrip.HQ.x264.Dolby.5.1.subs-MCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7e46bcc7cf2ec423c24907bd77828e995cc8f42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,228,107,204,124,242,236,66,60,36,144,123,215,120,40,233,149,204,143,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
