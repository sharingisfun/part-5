MB\nLanguage: English\nEncoder: sum1_here\nSource: pdf Thanks\n\n\n\nDetails:\n\nVoet, Voet and Pratt's Fundamentals of Biochemistry, 4e addresses the enormous advances in biochemistry, particularly in the areas of structural biology and Bioinformatics by providing a solid biochemical foundation that is rooted in chemistry to prepare students for the scientific challenges of the future. While continuing in its tradition of presenting complete and balanced coverage that is clearly written and relevant to human health and disease, Fundamentals of Biochemistry, 4e includes new pedagogy and enhanced visuals that provide a pathway for student learning. The authors are careful to present new information such that it links it to existing content, ever mindful that students assimilate new information only in the proper context. The enriched assessment content in WileyPLUS offers students the opportunity to gauge their conceptual understanding and receive immediate feedback to address misconceptions.\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:723512d0876209db4d33e6f9b37dfeab358af13a","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Biochemistry_Life+at+the+Molecular+Level+4th+ED+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"723512d0876209db4d33e6f9b37dfeab358af13a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,53,18,208,135,98,9,219,77,51,230,249,179,125,254,171,53,138,241,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
