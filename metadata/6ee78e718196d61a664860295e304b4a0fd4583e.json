The seven men have lived hard and fought harder all their lives and now all theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking forward to is a life of ease running the construction company they've started together. \nConnor isn't really looking to settle down. During his years in service he and his brothers had made a pact never to get hitched while they were still signed up. But after their old CO the man who'd been like a father to the seven young men he'd taken under his wing and molded into the men they were today died. They learned some things that didn't sit too well with them so they decided as a team to cash out. \nNow their homes are built and the business is going fine. There's just one blur on their otherwise perfect horizon. It seems someone has decided to use their quiet little slice of paradise for illegal activities. Not only that but the young and genteel Danielle Dupree has set her sights on the rough and rugged Connor and no matter what he does he can't seem to shake her. So he does the only thing left for him to do, he takes her. But can the well-bred southern belle and the street kid turned soldier find a balance?
