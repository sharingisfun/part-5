Schoedsack, and written by Ruth Rose and James Ashmore Creelman after a story by Cooper and Edgar Wallace. \n\nThe film tells of a gigantic island-dwelling gorilla-like creature called Kong who dies in an attempt to possess a beautiful young woman. \n\nKong is distinguished for its stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and its musical score by Max Steiner.\n\nKing Kong was officially released for the first time to DVD in November 2005, having undergone an extreme restoration process by Warner Brothers. The source for the DVD material was a well-preserved internegative  of the film found in the United Kingdom; it also had all censored scenes intact, and a new camera negative of the film was produced to replace the original, which had been destroyed.\n\nKing Kong (1933) Remastered and restored\nCommentary track\nEnglish subs\n\nRuntime 1h44m\nx264 AAC 2 pass encoded\n720 x 480 (4:3)\n24fps\n\nStarring \t\nFay Wray\nRobert Armstrong\nBruce Cabot\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6a664d283723569d11ffe3b8eb3570da084b801","amp;dn":"King+Kong+%281933%29+Remastered+%28DVDRip%29+%5Bespurious%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6a664d283723569d11ffe3b8eb3570da084b801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,166,100,210,131,114,53,105,209,31,254,59,142,179,87,13,160,132,184,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
