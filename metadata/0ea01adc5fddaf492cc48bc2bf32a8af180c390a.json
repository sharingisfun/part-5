The lower your handicap, the more of a religious experience it should be.\n\nWhile you don't have to be a rocket scientist to explain the forces at work in rolling a small, dimpled ball over changing terrain toward a cup that looks far too small for its purpose, Pelz was in fact a rocket scientist by trade. His approach is analytical, theoretical, mechanical, and systematic, brimming with graphs, charts, and illustrations. But don't let that scare you--for all the science, Pelz and the gospel he preaches are as inspiring as a good sermon and readily understandable regardless of your skill level. Yes, advanced players will no doubt be more intrigued with the depths Pelz plumbs, but high handicappers can draw solace from the quality of the supplicants who've sought his counsel--Lee Janzen, Annika Sorenstam, Steve Elkington, and Colin Montgomery, for starters--and proceed from there. Numbers, charts, and graphs aside, Pelz preaches good grip and stroke, proper reading of lines and distances, the importance of leaving a ball in the best location (that only seems obvious), and the need to identify your putting weaknesses, learn why they're your weaknesses, and address the proper fixes. &quot;Never give up on putting well,&quot; Pelz stresses. By studying his bible and heeding his golden rules, you'll find yourself standing over those knee-rattling, downhill 4-footers with a lot more going for you than just a prayer. --Jeff Silverman\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Do I believe in Dave Pelz?  I paid full price to go to his school, and it was the best money I've ever spent.  I could not have won my second U.S. Open without his help. I am a believer.&quot;\n--Lee Janzen\n\n&quot;Dave Pelz has added more irrefutable knowledge to golf instruction than any man alive.&quot;\n--George Peper, editor-in-chief, GOLF Magazine\n\n&quot;In one day's work with Pelz, I learned more about putting than I had known my entire life.&quot;\n--Curtis Strange\n\n&quot;You cannot do more for your putting than to follow Dave Pelz.&quot;\n--D.  A. Weibring\n\n&quot;Dave Pelz is the best.  It's pure and simple.  If you want to play your best, you work with the best...  that's Pelz.&quot;\n--Steve Elkington\n\n&quot;Dave Pelz knows more about putting than Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, and Ben Crenshaw combined!&quot;\n--GOLF Magazine -- Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea01adc5fddaf492cc48bc2bf32a8af180c390a","amp;dn":"Putting+Bible+-+Dave+Pelz+-++Golf+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea01adc5fddaf492cc48bc2bf32a8af180c390a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,160,26,220,95,221,175,73,44,196,139,194,191,50,168,175,24,12,57,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
