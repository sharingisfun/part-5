However, while most of the city appears to be rural, there are many traditional city elements as well. While set in a modern setting, the city also gives off a strange sense of nostalgia. The basis of the story is set in a high school setting. The first half of Rewrite primarily consists of the characters interacting in many everyday, enjoyable scenes. The latter half, however, is more serious, emotional, and carries a sense of mystery to the plot. As indicated by the title, rewriting is the theme of the game's scenario. The tagline for the game is, &quot;Could it possibly be rewritten, that fate of her's?&quot;.\n \n \n \nIf you play translated visual novels in English - visit fuwanovel.org                             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org&lt;/a&gt;                         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/71&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/71&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n \nNote: No installation required\nImportant: This game is prepatched into English.
