Taken from the album of the same name, it is one of his best-known singles. Rolling Stone ranked the song 275th on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2001, the RIAA's Songs of the Century placed the song 59th (out of 365). Lyrically, the song deals with the effects of the Vietnam War on Americans, although it is misinterpreted by some as purely patriotic.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; was directed by noted filmmaker John Sayles. It consisted of video concert footage of Springsteen and the E Street Band performing the song, poorly synchronized with audio from the studio recording. Released in mid-December 1984, there supposedly had not been enough time to mix the audio from the concert.\n\nThis footage was intermixed with compelling mid-1980s scenes of working-class America, emphasizing images that had some connection with the song, including Vietnam veterans, Amerasian children, assembly lines, oil refineries, cemeteries, and the like, finishing with a grizzled Springsteen posing in front of an American flag.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a64e9e3e8d563e298aaefcc0ee1383f2402204","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Born+In+The+U.S.A.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a64e9e3e8d563e298aaefcc0ee1383f2402204","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,166,78,158,62,141,86,62,41,138,174,252,192,238,19,131,242,64,34,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
