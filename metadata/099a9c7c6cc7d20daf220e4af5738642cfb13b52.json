My Ghetto Heroes\n\nThe Original track 9 was called &quot;Commercial&quot;, but at the time I ripped this back in '96 I didn't have room on the whole CD for the track.  It was 1:09 long, so the track listings have been modified for the omitted interlude.  All the songs are here though.\n\nIf you like the album then go buy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:099a9c7c6cc7d20daf220e4af5738642cfb13b52","amp;dn":"Master+P+-+The+Ice+Cream+Man+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"099a9c7c6cc7d20daf220e4af5738642cfb13b52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,154,156,124,108,199,210,13,175,34,14,74,245,115,134,66,207,177,59,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
