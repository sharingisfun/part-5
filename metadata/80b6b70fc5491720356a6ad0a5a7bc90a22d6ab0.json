None of these files have ever been posted anywhere before.\n\nNote: The books that end with &quot; - ocr.pdf&quot; have a layer of text behind the page image that has not been proof read. This makes them searchable. All other \n\nbooks are just page images. I'm sorry that I do not have the time to proof read more finely OCRed files that would have much smaller page sizes. If you do \n\nahve the time (and software,) go ahead and OCr them and repost them.\n\nIf you find errors, post a comment on TPB, and let me know.
