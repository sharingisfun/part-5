Sequel to the first Eddie and the Cruisers.  What it lacks for in acting makes up for with good music.  I saw the first one being on TPB but not the sequel so I decided to throw it up.  This is not my rip, so don't bitch about quality/sound issues.  It is an 80's movie so expect it to be passable quality.  I will seed whenever I can, just be patient please! Please comment!\n\n\n\n\nPlot::\n\nIn the sixties, Eddie and the cruisers was the hottest band around. But the tragic death of its lead singer broke the band up. Only Eddie is not dead. He works as a carpenter in Montreal. His love of music forces him to create a new band which will have to struggle with its anonymity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b90ac95f49b1b3077aa5c66be01cb14fe78421b","amp;dn":"Eddie+and+the+Cruisers+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b90ac95f49b1b3077aa5c66be01cb14fe78421b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,144,172,149,244,155,27,48,119,170,92,102,190,1,203,20,254,120,66,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
