On the other, Blake's music is so full of\nsilence and stillness that no one would be surprised if stage presence was a\nsecondary concern. He's a guy whose gig revolves around manipulating beats (and,\nof course, his own vocals), and that often means sitting still and letting the\nlight show work its magic.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tracklist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ \n01.
