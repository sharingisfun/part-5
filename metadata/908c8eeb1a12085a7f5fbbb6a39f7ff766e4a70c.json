It was recorded live in Dublin&amp;#039;s Vicar Street venue in November 2002. The inside cover reads &quot;for mic&quot; in reference to Mic Christopher, the late musician and friend of the band.\n\nThis was the first album by the band to reach #1 in the Irish Album Charts.\n\n    &quot;This glorious live recording shows exactly why the Frames are the darlings of Ireland&amp;#039;s music scene. Set List (is) a sublime distillation of the very best of their work to date. There are moments of transcendental magic on this album&quot; - Bruce Elder, The Sydney Morning Herald\n\nThis album showcases the Frames&amp;#039; ability to capture an audience&amp;#039;s interest as the crowd sings along to songs and reacts to frontman Glen Hansard&amp;#039;s anecdotes. Set List also features a number of covers interspersed into the middle of the Frames&amp;#039; own tunes such as the version of Johnny Cash&amp;#039;s &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; during &quot;Lay Me Down&quot; and Bob Marley&amp;#039;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot; at the end of &quot;Your Face&quot; and also a tease of &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; from Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory in &quot;Star Star&quot;.\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Revelate&quot;\n   2. &quot;Star Star&quot;\n   3. &quot;Lay Me Down&quot;\n   4. &quot;God Bless Mom&quot;\n   5. &quot;What Happens When the Heart Just Stops&quot;\n   6. &quot;Rent Day Blues&quot;\n   7. &quot;Pavement Tune&quot;\n   8. &quot;Stars are Underground&quot;\n   9. &quot;Santa Maria&quot;\n  10. &quot;Perfect Opening Line&quot;\n  11. &quot;Your Face&quot;\n  12. &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;\n  13. &quot;The Blood&quot;\n\n[edit] Band line-up\n\n    * Glen Hansard - guitar, vocals\n    * Colm Mac Con Iomaire - violin, keyboards, vocals\n    * Joseph Doyle - bass guitar, vocals\n    * Rob Bochnik - lead guitar\n    * Dave Hingerty - drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:908c8eeb1a12085a7f5fbbb6a39f7ff766e4a70c","amp;dn":"The+Frames--Set+List+%282003%29--Live+Album--vikingsfreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"908c8eeb1a12085a7f5fbbb6a39f7ff766e4a70c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,140,142,235,26,18,8,90,127,95,187,182,163,159,127,247,102,228,167,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
