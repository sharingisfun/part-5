Waugh, and Martin H.

From the birth of the genre through Edger Allen Poe's C. Auguste Dupin, to the most famous clue seeking sleuth of them all, Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, a variety of literary minds turned to crime writing.\r\n\r\nEach story in this highly entertaining collection is significant for its contribution to the development of crime solving literature. There are ghastly crimes committed in the dark of night and master detectives at work to insure that justice is served. In a story by Thomas Hardy, we are introduced to a thief who outwits his hangman, and in an attack on civic self- righteousness, Mark Twain shows us a man who succeeds in stealing virtue from an entire town.\r\n\r\nOther writers in this collection include the great American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, Wilkie Collins-often called &quot; the father of the English detective story,&quot;- and Grant Allen, best remembered for his humorous stories of Colonel Clay, the first heroic rogue character of short crime fiction.\r\n\r\nIn total, there are 15 stories of criminal mystery and detection included in ISAAC ASIMOV PRESENTS THE BEST CRIME STORIES OF THE 19TH CENTURY;enough clue seeking and cleverness in the pursuit of justice to please the most avid devotee to the genre.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nInternationally acclaimed and known for his science-fiction work, ISAAC ASI MOV also edited numerous science-fiction and non -fiction anthologies.\r\nMARTIN H. GREENBERG and CHARLES G.WAUGH are established science-fiction writers who, as part of the Asimov editorial team, have distinguished themselves also as experts in the field of short stories about crime, mystery and detection.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction vii\r\nMr. Higginbotham's Catastrophe, Nathaniel Hawthorne 1\r\nThe Purloined Letter, Edgar Allan Poe 14\r\nA Terribly Strange Bed, Wilkie Collins 34\r\nMurder Under the Microscope, William Russell 51\r\nThe Three Strangers, Thomas Hardy 72\r\nGallegher, Richard Harding Davis 96\r\nThe Red-Headed League, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 126\r\nCheating the Gallows, Israel Zangwill 151\r\nThe Chemistry of Anarchy, Robert Barr 165\r\nThe Sheriff of Gullmore, Melville Davisson Post 177\r\nThe Episode of the Mexican Seer, Grant Allen 202\r\nThe Affair of the &quot;Avalanche Bicycle and\r\nTyre Co., Ltd.,&quot; Arthur Morrison 217\r\nThe Nameless Man, Rodriguez Ottolengui 241\r\nHis Defense, Harry Stillwell Edwards 253\r\nThe Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg, Mark Twain 266\r\nAbout the Authors 316\r\n\r\nThis book was not available in digital version on the web , so scanned my own copy &amp; am sharing it here.\r\n \nhttp://s15.postimg.org/4lutfpb6j/The_Best_Crime_Srories_of_the_19th_Century.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cfa5a75d949bdaa748e2d8bb752e294a2e5ffb7","amp;dn":"The+Best+Crime+Srories+of+the+19th+Century+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cfa5a75d949bdaa748e2d8bb752e294a2e5ffb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,250,90,117,217,73,189,170,116,142,45,139,183,82,226,148,162,229,255,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
