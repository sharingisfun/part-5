Honestly, none of them look particularly brilliant, but I never upload anything that I don't think is worth taking the time to view/read, so take my over critical opinions with a grain of salt.\n\nThis one sometimes looks really good, sometimes it looks like something is slightly off. Like its a bit out of focus. I'm not sure if this is a product of the art, or possibly the scan, but in general its still good enough to read (particularly if you're a Pratchett fan and haven't read these graphic novels yet).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a25ecbd86df9e440bb07805af223cff0287c45","amp;dn":"Terry+Pratchett+-+The+Light+Fantastic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a25ecbd86df9e440bb07805af223cff0287c45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,162,94,203,216,109,249,228,64,187,7,128,90,242,35,207,240,40,124,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
