Written by a practitioner for practitioners, this book delivers the kind of knowledge and skills traders and finance professionals need to fully understand derivatives and price and hedge them effectively. Most derivatives books are written by academics and are long on theory and short on the day-to-day realities of derivatives trading. Of the few practical guides available, very few of those cover pricing and hedgingÃ¢â‚¬â€two critical topics for traders. What matters to practitioners is what happens on the trading floorÃ¢â‚¬â€information only seasoned practitioners such as authors Marroni and Perdomo can impart.\n\n-Lays out proven derivatives pricing and hedging strategies and techniques for equities, FX, fixed income and commodities, as well as multi-assets and cross-assets\n-Provides expert guidance on the development of structured products, supplemented with a range of practical examples\n-Packed with real-life examples covering everything from option payout with delta hedging, to Monte Carlo procedures to common structured products payoffs\n-The Companion Website features all of the examples from the book in Excel complete with source code\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface ix\n\nAcknowledgements xi\n\n1 An Introduction to the Major Asset Classes 1\n\n1.1 Equities 1\n\n1.2 Commodities 5\n\n1.3 Fixed Income 12\n\n1.4 Foreign Exchange 15\n\nSummary 17\n\n2 Derivatives: Forwards, Futures and Swaps 19\n\n2.1 Derivatives 19\n\n2.2 Forward Contracts 20\n\n2.3 Futures Contracts 24\n\n2.4 Calculating Implied Forward Prices and Valuing Existing Forward Contracts 26\n\n2.5 Pricing Futures Contracts 34\n\n2.6 Swaps 35\n\nSummary 49\n\n3 Derivatives: Options and Related Strategies 51\n\n3.1 Call Options 51\n\n3.2 Put Options 55\n\n3.3 Boundary Conditions for Call and Put Options Prices 58\n\n3.4 PutÃ¢â‚¬â€œCall Parity 61\n\n3.5 Swaptions 63\n\n3.6 Options Strategies 64\n\nSummary 76\n\n4 Binomial Option Pricing 77\n\n4.1 One-Period Binomial Tree: Replication Approach 77\n\n4.2 Risk-Neutral Valuation 83\n\n4.3 Two-Period Binomial Tree: Valuing Back Down the Tree 85\n\n4.4 The Binomial Tree: A Generalization 89\n\n4.5 Early Exercise and American Options 90\n\n4.6 Volatility Calibration 90\n\nSummary 92\n\n5 The Fundamentals of Option Pricing 93\n\n5.1 Intrinsic Value and Time Value of an Option 93\n\n5.2 What is Volatility and Why Does it Matter? 95\n\n5.3 Measurement of Realized Volatility and Correlation 97\n\n5.4 Option Pricing in the BlackÃ¢â‚¬â€œScholes Framework 99\n\n5.5 The Option Delta and the Replication of the Option Payoff 100\n\n5.6 Option Replication 102\n\n5.7 Option Replication, Risk-Neutral Valuation and Delta Hedging Revisited 104\n\n5.8 Options on Dividend Paying Assets 106\n\n5.9 Options on Futures: The Black Model 107\n\n5.10 Monte Carlo Pricing 108\n\n5.11 Other Pricing Techniques 112\n\n5.12 Pricing Techniques Summary 113\n\n5.13 The Excel Spreadsheet Ã¢â‚¬Å“Option ReplicationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ 114\n\nSummary 117\n\n6 Implied Volatility and the Greeks 121\n\n6.1 Implied Volatility 121\n\n6.2 The Greeks 123\n\n6.3 Delta and its Dynamics 123\n\n6.4 Gamma and its Dynamics 127\n\n6.5 Vega and its Dynamics 132\n\n6.6 Theta and its Dynamics 136\n\n6.7 Rho 142\n\n6.8 Option Trading 143\n\n6.9 Some Additional Remarks (in Q&amp;A Format) 146\n\n6.10 An Example of the Behaviour of Implied Volatility: EUR/USD Rate and S&amp;P 500 in 2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012 147\n\nSummary 148\n\n7 Volatility Smile and the Greeks of Option Strategies 151\n\n7.1 The Volatility Smile Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Why is the Implied Volatility Not Flat Across Different Strikes? 151\n\n7.2 The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sticky DeltaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sticky StrikeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Approaches to Describing Volatility Smile 153\n\n7.3 The Volatility Term Structure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Why is the Implied Volatility Not Flat Across Different Expiries? 155\n\n7.4 The Volatility Surface Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Combining Smile and Term Structure 156\n\n7.5 Analysing the Greeks of Common Option Strategies 158\n\n7.6 Some Additional Remarks on Straddles, Risk Reversals and Butterflies 170\n\n7.7 Vega Hedging is Not Just Simply Offsetting Overall Vega Exposure 171\n\n7.8 Hedging Volatility Risk: A Brief Introduction of the VannaÃ¢â‚¬â€œVolga Approach 172\n\n7.9 The Volatility Smile Ã¢â‚¬â€œ One Step Further 173\n\n7.10 Pricing Exotic Options 178\n\n7.11 Different Types of Volatility 179\n\nSummary 184\n\n8 Exotic Derivatives 185\n\n8.1 Exotic Derivatives with Fixed Payoffs 185\n\n8.2 Other Common Exotic Derivatives 188\n\n8.3 European Digital Options: Pricing and Greeks 191\n\n8.4 Other Exotic Options: Pricing and Greeks 200\n\nSummary 208\n\n9 Multi-Asset Derivatives 209\n\n9.1 Basket Options 209\n\n9.2 Best-of and Worst-of Options 211\n\n9.3 Quanto Derivatives 222\n\n9.4 Ã¢â‚¬Å“CompoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Derivatives 225\n\nSummary 227\n\n10 Structured Products 229\n\n10.1 Definition 229\n\n10.2 Common Features 229\n\n10.3 Principal Protection 230\n\n10.4 The Benefit to the Issuer 231\n\n10.5 Redemption Amounts and Participation 232\n\n10.6 Principal at Risk: Embedding a Short Option 234\n\n10.7 More Complicated Payoffs 235\n\n10.8 Auto-Callable Note: Pricing and Risk Profile 238\n\n10.9 One Step Forward: The Worst-of Digital Note 240\n\n10.10 A Real-Life Example of Structured Product 241\n\n10.11 Liquidity and Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) 242\n\nSummary 243\n\nIndex 245\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\nLEONARDO MARRONI is an asset manager with the Emerging Markets team at GLG Partners in London.
