The extensive teaching experience of the authorship team provides first-hand knowledge of the learning skill levels of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s student which is reflected in the text through the pedagogy and the tying together of real world problems and examples with the fundamentals of Engineering Mechanics. Designed to teach students how to effectively analyze problems before plugging numbers into formulas, students benefit tremendously as they encounter real life problems that may not always fit into standard formulas. This book was designed with a rich, concise, two-color presentation and has a stand alone Study Guide which includes further problems, examples, and case studies. \n\n\n\n\n# Andrew Pytel - The Pennsylvania State University\n# Jaan Kiusalaas - The Pennsylvania State University\n# ISBN-10: 0495244694  \n#ISBN-13: 9780495244691 \n# 560 Pages  HB \n#Published  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2010     ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb9d5df5dd542b407278094e111146660a3716d","amp;dn":"Engineering+Mechanics%3A+Statics%2C+3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb9d5df5dd542b407278094e111146660a3716d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,185,213,223,93,213,66,180,7,39,128,148,225,17,20,102,96,163,113,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
