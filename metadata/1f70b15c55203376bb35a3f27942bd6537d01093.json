Working at different firms, they come to this realization separately; but after they discover one another, the flash boys band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency tradingÃ¢â‚¬â€source of the most intractable problemsÃ¢â‚¬â€will have no advantage whatsoever.The characters in Flash Boys are fabulous, each completely different from what you think of when you think Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wall Street guy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Several have walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the big banks, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stock exchanges, and high-frequency trading firms as they have never been investigated, and expose the many strange new ways that Wall Street generates profits.The light that Lewis shines into the darkest corners of the financial world may not be good for your blood pressure, because if you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you. But in the end, Flash Boys is an uplifting read. Here are people who have somehow preserved a moral sense in an environment where you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get paid for that; they have perceived an institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war to fix it.\n\nKirkus Reviews\n\nIn trademark Lewis (Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World, 2011, etc.) fashion, a data-rich but all-too-human tale of &quot;heuristic data bullshit and other mumbo jumbo&quot; in the service of gaming the financial system, courtesy ofÃ¢â‚¬â€yes, Goldman Sachs and company.That stuff you see on TV about dinging bells and ulcer-stricken traders pacing the floor of the New York Stock Exchange? It's theater. The real speculative economy lives invisibly in little wires that go to nodes in out-of-the-way places, monitored by computer, shares bought and sold by algorithm. If you send a sell order, it might get intercepted for a fraction of a second by an intermediary that can manipulate the order to squeeze off one one-hundredth of a penny in profitÃ¢â‚¬â€small on the individual level but big when you consider the millions of trades made every day. Both the system and that process are considerably more complex than that, but this fact remains: It dawned on someone that a person could grow rich laying ever faster optic cables to selected clients, cutting deals with the governments of towns and counties &quot;in order to be able to tunnel through them,&quot; all perfectly legal if not exactly in the spirit of the market. Lewis follows his tried-and-true methods of taking a big story of this sort and deconstructing it to key players, some on the inside, some on the outside, at least one an unlikely hero. In this case, that unlikely hero is an exceedingly mild-mannered Japanese-Canadian banker who assembled a team of techies and numbers nerds to track the nefarious ways of the HFT worldÃ¢â‚¬â€that is, the high-frequency traders and the firms that engaged in &quot;dark pool arbitrage&quot; as just another asset in their portfolios of corruption.If you've ever had the feeling that the system is out for itself at your expense, well, look no further. A riveting, maddening yarn that is causing quite a stir already, including calls for regulatory reform.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f70b15c55203376bb35a3f27942bd6537d01093","amp;dn":"Michael+Lewis+-+Flash+Boys+-+A+Wall+Street+Revolt+%5B96%5D+Unabridge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f70b15c55203376bb35a3f27942bd6537d01093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,112,177,92,85,32,51,118,187,53,163,242,121,66,189,101,55,208,16,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
