How do you go about crafting the right message, the tone, the line work and getting it to work in the environment it's supposed to; be it mobile, operating system, or browser. Thankfully we now have the place to go.\n\nJon Hicks' 'The Icon Handbook' will become the go-to book for the modern designer; for uncovering the thought processes, the skills and the reference for designing your own icons.\n\nThis book is aimed at designers who already have basic vector and bitmap drawing skills. It could be that you want to create a simple, unique favicon, or perhaps you've been asked to work on a mobile app that requires them. It starts at the basics and takes you right the way through to being able to create stunning iconography.\n\n\nPub:Five Simple Steps (2011)\n\nAuthor:J.Hicks\n\nEnglish\n\n323 Pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee67a179fc2812a5b2ab4d17be01f3b8414025ba","amp;dn":"The+Icon+Handbook+%28Graphic+Design%29+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee67a179fc2812a5b2ab4d17be01f3b8414025ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,103,161,121,252,40,18,165,178,171,77,23,190,1,243,184,65,64,37,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
