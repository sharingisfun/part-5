With Linux Networking Cookbook, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll dive straight into the gnarly hands-on work of building and maintaining a computer network.\n\nRunning a network doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean you have all the answers. Networking is a complex subject with reams of reference material thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to keep straight, much less remember. If you want a book that lays out the steps for specific tasks, that clearly explains the commands and configurations, and does not tax your patience with endless ramblings and meanderings into theory and obscure RFCs, this is the book for you.\n\nYou will find recipes for:\n- Building a gateway, firewall, and wireless access point on a Linux network\n- Building a VoIP server with Asterisk\n- Secure remote administration with SSH\n- Building secure VPNs with OpenVPN, and a Linux PPTP VPN server\n- Single sign-on with Samba for mixed Linux/Windows LANs\n- Centralized network directory with OpenLDAP\n- Network monitoring with Nagios or MRTG\n- Getting acquainted with IPv6\n- Setting up hands-free networks installations of new systems\n- Linux system administration via serial console\n\nAnd a lot more. Each recipe includes a clear, hands-on solution with tested code, plus a discussion on why it works. When you need to solve a network problem without delay, and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the time or patience to comb through reference books or the Web for answers, Linux Networking Cookbook gives you exactly what you need.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
