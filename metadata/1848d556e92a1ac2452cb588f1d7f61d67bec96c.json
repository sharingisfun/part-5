His novels and short stories deal mainly with the history, folklore, and culture of his native Bosnia under the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe three principal novels included here comprise the &quot;Bosnian trilogy&quot;, which were written during World War II and released simultaneously in 1945.  They are, however, connected only thematically and are three completely different works:\n\nSet during the Napoleonic era, BOSNIAN CHRONICLE is a portrayal of conflict and fierce ethnic loyalties in a region that stubbornly refuses to submit to any outsider.  Ottoman viziers, French consuls, and Austrian plenipotentiaries are consumed by an endless game of diplomacy and double-dealing, while the Bosnians themselves observe and endure the machinations of greater powers that vie, futilely, to absorb them. \n\nTHE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA is a vivid depiction of the suffering history has imposed upon the people of Bosnia from the late 16th century to the beginning of World War I.  \n\nTHE WOMAN FROM SARAJEVO is set in the cities of Sarajevo and Belgrade during the first three decades of the 20th century.  It is the tragic life of a woman, Miss Raika RadakoviÃ„â€¡, disappointed in people and the world she lives in, who is dominated by a single-minded greed for money and puts everything else out of her life: love, friendship, concern for other people.\n\nThe collection is rounded but by the novel DEVIL'S YARD (1954), two anthologies of short stories, and a volume featuring his Nobel Prize acceptance speech and associated materials.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format:\n\n* BOSNIAN CHRONICLE (Arcade, 1993).
