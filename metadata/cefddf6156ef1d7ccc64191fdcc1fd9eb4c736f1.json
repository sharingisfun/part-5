Protecting What's His (Line of Duty, #1) \nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running from the law, and the law wants her bad.\nThe opportunity was just too damn delicious for Ginger Peet to pass up. The purse full of money she findsÃ¢â‚¬â€$50,000 to be exactÃ¢â‚¬â€could give her and her teen sister the new start they need. So she grabs the cash, her gothy sibling, and their life-sized statue of Dolly Parton, and blows outta Nashville in a cloud of dust. Chicago, here we come...\nTurns out, Chicago has some pretty hot cops. Hot, intense, naughty-lookinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cops like Derek Tyler, who looks like he could eat a girl up and leave her begging for more. And more. Tempting as he is, getting involved with the sexy homicide lieutenant next door poses a teensy problem for a gal whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the lam. But one thing is certainÃ¢â‚¬â€DerekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s onto her, and he wants more than just a taste. \nAnd as far as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerned, possession is nine-tenths of the law.\n\n2. His Risk to Take (Line of Duty #2)\nHomicide cop Troy Bennett had a reputation on the Chicago PD for being fearless and in controlÃ¢â‚¬â€until the night his daredevil partner is killed during a raid. From that moment on, he swears heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never again be responsible for the loss of a loved one. To escape his demons, Troy transfers to the NYPD, bringing him up close and personal with Ruby Elliott, a beautiful, street-savvy pool hustler.\nReckless and stubbornly independent, Ruby embodies everything TroyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s avoiding, but when she walks into OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢HanlonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pub and blows his carefully laid plans to hell, Troy knows he has to have herÃ¢â‚¬â€risks be damned. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a connection between RubyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadowed past and a case TroyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s working involving a notorious Brooklyn felon, throwing her safety into jeopardy. Confronted with his biggest fear, will Troy push Ruby away to keep her safe or fight to keep her in his arms where she belongs?\n\n3. Officer Off Limits (Line of Duty #3)\nHis need to possess her is non-negotiable. \nStory BrooksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fiancÃƒÂ© just called off their wedding two weeks before the happy day. As if that isn't bad enough, her semi-estranged father, an infamous NYPD hostage negotiator, has suffered a heart attack. Not wanting to examine her lack of emotion over the broken engagement, she hops on a plane to reconnect with her father before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late.\nPlayboy hostage negotiator Daniel Chase has never, not once, been refused by a woman, so when a debate over hospital snack foods with a delectable kindergarten teacher ends in flat-out rejection, he makes it his mission to seduce her. His only obstacle? SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the daughter of his mentor who implicitly forbade Daniel from pursuing her.\nDespite her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warnings and DanielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled past, Daniel and Story canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist their intense attraction to one another. But when the reason for her fiancÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s abrupt wedding cancellation comes to light, can Story and Daniel's already forbidden relationship survive?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cefddf6156ef1d7ccc64191fdcc1fd9eb4c736f1","amp;dn":"Tessa+Bailey+Line+of+Duty+1-3+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cefddf6156ef1d7ccc64191fdcc1fd9eb4c736f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,253,223,97,86,239,29,124,204,100,25,31,220,193,253,158,180,199,54,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
