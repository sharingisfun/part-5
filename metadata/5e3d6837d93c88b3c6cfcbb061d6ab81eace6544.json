Drawing on groundbreaking original research and startling statistics, The Triple Package uncovers the secret to their success. A superiority complex, insecurity, impulse controlÃ¢â‚¬â€these are the elements of the Triple Package, the rare and potent cultural constellation that drives disproportionate group success. The Triple Package is open to anyone. America itself was once a Triple Package culture. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been losing that edge for a long time now. Even as headlines proclaim the death of upward mobility in America, the truth is that the oldfashioned American Dream is very much aliveÃ¢â‚¬â€butsome groups have a cultural edge, which enables them to take advantage of opportunity far more than others.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Americans are taught that everyone is equal, that no group is superior to another. But remarkably, all of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful groups believe (even\n if they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say so aloud) that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re exceptional, chosen, superior in some way.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Americans are taught that self-esteemÃ¢â‚¬â€feeling good about yourselfÃ¢â‚¬â€is the key to a successful life. But in all of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful groups,\n people tend to feel insecure, inadequate, that they have to prove themselves.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ America today spreads a message of immediate gratification, living for the moment. But all of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful groups cultivate heightened discipline and impulse control.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e3d6837d93c88b3c6cfcbb061d6ab81eace6544","amp;dn":"The+Triple+Package+%282014%29+epub+-+Amy+Chua","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e3d6837d93c88b3c6cfcbb061d6ab81eace6544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,61,104,55,217,60,136,179,198,207,203,176,97,214,171,129,234,206,101,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
