The band say the material will have a more raw and anthemic sound compared to their previous work.\n\nTom Smith explained the band's change in direction by saying: &quot;If we'd tried to make another more traditional guitar record, I don't think we'd have got through it... for our own sanity, we had to do something we hadn't done before.&quot; He also revealed that the heavily synthesised and industrial feel of the album had evolved in a recording session that took place in 2008, before they settled on Flood as a producer. Bassist Russell Leetch said the experience of working with Flood had been &quot;the most fun we've ever had in a studio&quot; and hinted that the band would be likely to work with him again.\n\nTracks:\n\n101  In This Light And On This Evening\n102  Bricks And Mortar\n103  Papillon\n104  You Don't Know Love\n105  The Big Exit\n106  The Boxer\n107  Like Treasure\n108  Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool\n109  Walk The Fleet Road\n201  This House Is Full Of Noise\n202  I Want A Forest\n203  A Life As A Ghost\n204  Human\n205  For The Money\n\nEnjoy, SvC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e989f4409b184e0593977a53d2d69394aef6c6","amp;dn":"Editors+-+In+This+Light+And+On+This+Evening+%5BDE%5D+%5B2009-mp3-320%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e989f4409b184e0593977a53d2d69394aef6c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,233,137,244,64,155,24,78,5,147,151,122,83,210,214,147,148,174,246,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
