Her mother is originally from the Canary Islands.\n\nBecause of her grandparents&amp;#039; import-export business, she lived with her parents first in London, where she was born; and later in Chicago and La Habra, California, where she grew up. After her parents&amp;#039; separation at age 12, she moved to Barcelona with her mother and younger brother and sister. Having grown up in the United States, Dimech initially spoke only English when she first moved to Spain. She was placed in an American school at first, but later befriended some local Spanish children who helped teach her Spanish.\n\nDuring the 1960s she learned to play guitar and began to write her own songs. She styled her music after American folk music, and her idols included Bob Dylan, Donovan, and the Byrds. Later she joined the student band Pic-Nic as a singer, who in 1969 had a measure of success with a folk version of the Spanish children&amp;#039;s song &quot;CÃƒÂ¡llate niÃƒÂ±a&quot;. Other notable songs of theirs included &quot;Amanecer&quot; and &quot;No digas nada&quot;.\n\nAfter the band split up at the end of the 1960s, she moved to Vienna with her husband, the Hungarian musician Laszlo Kristof. At the start of the 1970s, she began her solo career with her hit first single, &quot;Soy rebelde&quot; (I am a rebel). On the single, the record label misspelled her name as &quot;Jeanette&quot; (the correct spelling is Janette without the first E.) Ever since then, her stage name has been spelled with the additional E. The single first enjoyed success in Spanish-speaking countries, and later broadened its influence with French and English versions. This song and others penned by Manuel Alejandro, such as &quot;El muchacho de los ojos tristes&quot; and &quot;Estoy triste&quot; established her as an artist in Spain.\n\nIn 1981 she recorded another record: &quot;CorazÃƒÂ³n de Poeta&quot; which was composed, arranged and conducted by Manuel Alejandro, that gave her three hit singles: &quot;CorazÃƒÂ³n de Poeta&quot;, &quot;Frente a frente&quot; &amp; &quot;Un dÃƒÂ­a es un dÃƒÂ­a&quot;. Her greatest success, &quot;Porque te vas&quot; (&quot;Because you leave&quot;), was written by JosÃƒÂ© Luis Perales and remained relatively unknown at the start of 1974. Only when the song was used in Carlos Saura&amp;#039;s 1976 film CrÃƒÂ­a Cuervos (Raise Crows), and the film went on be honoured at the Cannes Film Festival (Jury grand prize) and the Berlin Film Festival (jury special prize), did the song become internationally known and a hit. In Austria it reached number 13, in Switzerland number 4, and in Germany it even reached number 1.\n\nThe song was covered in 1996 by the Brazilian pop-rock band Pato Fu (album &quot;Tem mas acabou&quot;), and in 1997 by Mexican female group &quot;Aurora y la Academia&quot;. Also Jose Luis Perales, author of &quot;Porque te vas&quot;, recorded the song featuring Amaia Montero from Spanish group La Oreja de Van Gogh In 2006 by the duo Los Super Elegantes. The song which is on the album &quot;Channelizing Paradise&quot; also has an English version done as part of the track.\n\nAlthough after &quot;Porque te vas&quot; Jeanette never achieved similar international success, she continued singing relatively successfully in Spain (and to a lesser degree France) well into the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e19330e7d9c3f1d4e18cedb75a185c530b0f60f","amp;dn":"Jeanette+20+Exitos+Originales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e19330e7d9c3f1d4e18cedb75a185c530b0f60f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,25,51,14,125,156,63,29,78,24,206,219,117,161,133,197,48,176,246,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
