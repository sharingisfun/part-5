Through case studies of citizens in different countries, the film explores a range of factors that have led to the present crisis, economic and identity challenges across Europe. High-level experts analyse how and why things are going so wrong.\n\nThe film includes fictional scenes, set in a post-EU future, which feature archaeologist Charles Granda (played by Angus Deayton) travelling on a flight through a menacing storm, explaining to a child passenger what the EU was. Sombre, thought-provoking and witty, the film frames Europe through the eyes of those who have most at stake - the Europeans themselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16bb1af6b6a2ea1b89f56046acd2c1213dfbad4e","amp;dn":"The+Great+European+Disaster+Movie+%7C+BBC.HD.ZigCOM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16bb1af6b6a2ea1b89f56046acd2c1213dfbad4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,187,26,246,182,162,234,27,137,245,96,70,172,210,193,33,61,251,173,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
