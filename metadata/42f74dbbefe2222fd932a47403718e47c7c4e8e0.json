Using a series of databases it will add lights to roads and other areas. Hundreds of thousands of lights (in some Night Environment editions millions) clearly show how highways connect cities and how smaller roads meander into neighborhoods. Visual navigation at night becomes a real option and even easier than during daytime just as it often is in real aviation.\n\nNight Environment database contains many times more roads then FSX, so you will see roads at night where you will see none during daytime. All lights are potentially visible for 60 miles so large areas will light up around you. As the highway lights are raised above the surface and have a lit bitmap below them, a correct 3d effect is created.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    * Full coverage of each country/region\n    * All major roads and most minor roads will be lit\n    * Compatible with all 3rd party scenery products (including FTX and all photo scenery, FlyTampa Dubai OMDB, etc)\n    * Configurable for hardware performance\n    * Compatible with Steve`s DX10 fixer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42f74dbbefe2222fd932a47403718e47c7c4e8e0","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+Aerosoft+Night+Environment+Pack+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42f74dbbefe2222fd932a47403718e47c7c4e8e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,247,77,187,239,226,34,47,217,50,164,116,3,113,142,71,199,196,232,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
