I rented &quot;Demon Seed&quot; because I felt like watching something with a brain, and based on a lot of positive IMDb reviews, I was praying for a smart sci-if flick.

The dialog is thought provoking and thankfully never really insults the audience's intelligence.\n\nHelming the director's seat is Donald Cammell, who directs with a firm hand and injects a claustrophobic and uncomfortable atmosphere into the film, also managing to maintain the suspense scenes well.
