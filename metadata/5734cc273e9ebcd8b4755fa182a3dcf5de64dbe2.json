As you develop your custom HDRI map you see its lighting effect in real-time on your 3D scene - either by using HDR Light Studio connected 'Live' to your 3D app or using it standalone with the included interactive renderer - LiveLight.\n\nHDR Light StudioÃ¢â€žÂ¢ has been created for 3D computer graphic artists wanting to create studio photography style renderings of products, packaging and vehicles. Surrounding your 3D data with a good quality studio HDRI map helps to create an image that is a good match for traditional photography, and can then be used for advertising and marketing.\n\nStudio photographers surround their subject matter with different shaped light sources, reflectors and lighting effects - carefully positioning them all to bring out the best in the items being photographed - controlling both the lighting and reflections. This is most important for surfaces that are shiny and reflective - like gloss plastics, metallic paints and chrome/metallic finishes.\n\nSo at last you can quickly replicate these studio lighting techniques with your own bespoke HDRI maps, made to measure for each of your rendering projects. HDR Light StudioÃ¢â€žÂ¢ gives you the freedom to quickly adjust your lighting setup to ensure the best results - just like a real photo-shoot!\n\n\n=========\n[Features]:\n=========\n\nLight shots faster\nQuickly explore and perfect your lighting by placing lighting and edits directly in your shot with instant feedback.\n\nIncrease image quality\nHDR Light Studio brings a higher level of control to your lighting through realistic HDR captures and procedural lighting and effects that will bring your materials to life.\n\nMaximise existing content\nEnhance and augment existing HDRI maps to control their effect on your shot. Create plausible lighting for use with existing back-plates using powerful color matching tools.\n\nCompatibility\nHDRI maps can be used by any renderer with predictable results. Lighting can be created standalone or through a live connection with your 3D software.\nReduce render times\nTake advantage of image based lighting to significantly reduce your final render times or to light real-time assets.\n\n\n====================\n[System Requirements]:\n====================\n\nOS: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP (Only 64-Bit)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5734cc273e9ebcd8b4755fa182a3dcf5de64dbe2","amp;dn":"HDR+Light+Studio+v4.3+%2B+Live+Plugins-XFORCE+%5BATOM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5734cc273e9ebcd8b4755fa182a3dcf5de64dbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,52,204,39,62,158,188,216,180,117,95,161,130,163,220,245,222,100,219,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
