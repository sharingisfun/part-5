They were understandably nervous about his\nre-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good\nidea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous,\nhedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no\nmoney and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker\ngangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way.\nMost of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to\nfight back and take over the city himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3836afa988546087bf19b016eb6a94f2d837a1d0","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+-+Vice+City+%28with+trainer%29%281-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3836afa988546087bf19b016eb6a94f2d837a1d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,54,175,169,136,84,96,135,191,25,176,22,235,106,148,242,216,55,161,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
