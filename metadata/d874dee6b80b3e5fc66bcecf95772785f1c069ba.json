Whatever it is , it makes the songs pleasant to listen to . \n\nTake &quot;oblivious&quot; for example , trilling latin guitars ,cooing backing vocals and an infectious beat - hit single written all over it . Following that would be tricky but he actually betters its sunny disposition several times with great tunes like &quot;pillar to post&quot; &quot;walk out to winter&quot; and &quot;we could send letters&quot; . &quot;back on board&quot; is another favourite with its moping strums and gusts of organ and harmonica. \n\n1 Oblivious   3:12 \n2 The Boy Wonders   3:15 \n3 Walk Out to Winter   3:25 \n4 The Bugle Sounds Again   2:58 \n5 We Could Send Letters   5:49 \n6 Pillar to Post   4:02 \n7 Release   3:41 \n8 Lost Outside the Tunnel   3:42 \n9 Back on Board   4:53 \n10 Down the Dip   2:23 \n11 Haywire   3:58 \n12 Orchid Girl   2:35 \n13 Queen's Tattoos   2:09 \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d874dee6b80b3e5fc66bcecf95772785f1c069ba","amp;dn":"Aztec+Camera+-+High+Land%2C+Hard+Rain+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D+%5BReissue%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d874dee6b80b3e5fc66bcecf95772785f1c069ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,116,222,230,184,11,62,95,198,107,206,207,149,119,39,133,241,192,105,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
