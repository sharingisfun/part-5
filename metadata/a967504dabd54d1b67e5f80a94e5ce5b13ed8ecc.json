They are direct witnesses to the street fights against Germans and dream of shooting the &quot;real&quot; war.\n\nInitially, however, they document the life of capital's civilians. Such materials are expected from their commander, giving them the task of preparing the journal, which is to be displayed in the cinema &quot;Palladium&quot;. Looking for suitable shots they go deeper and deeper into actual fights. In the end, they manage to join one of the fight units, which they follow in action.\n\nThe characters realize that they had to participate in something beyond their wildest dreams - the world in which they find themselves is the world after the apocalypse. They realize that their role is to document the apocalypse and keep safe the tapes at all costs. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/35b4e2fd52bbceadf1c7a934a1e5a88ebc61db93.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/35b4e2fd52bbceadf1c7a934a1e5a88ebc61db93.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVD COPY, SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH AND POLISH","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a967504dabd54d1b67e5f80a94e5ce5b13ed8ecc","amp;dn":"Powstanie+Warszawskie+Film+2014+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a967504dabd54d1b67e5f80a94e5ce5b13ed8ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,103,80,77,171,213,77,27,103,229,248,10,148,229,206,91,19,237,142,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
