CÃƒÂ©zanne can be said to form the bridge between late 19th-century Impressionism and the early 20th century's new line of artistic enquiry, Cubism. Both Matisse and Picasso are said to have remarked that Cezanne &quot;is the father of us all.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de919b62d4ad135c2ea6931cb081ee9df94434d6","amp;dn":"Paul+Cezanne+Paintings+%281839-1906+Art+nrg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de919b62d4ad135c2ea6931cb081ee9df94434d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,145,155,98,212,173,19,92,46,166,147,28,176,129,238,157,249,68,52,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
