Although more of a &quot;mood piece&quot; than a full arc, I have added all relevant sub-issues of Uncanny X-Men, X-Men: Legacy, and Deadpool as well as all four issues of Nation X itself as well as the X-Factor one shot. This is the best suggested reading order I could find, but really you can read them in any order so feel free to use the Wikipedia order or any others if you feel it lacking. All credit to the original uploaders and scanners, and remember - please seed! Enjoy, and thanks! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90a8bbf2b9fb36509e0cf1a6cda44d9585f737dd","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+Nation+X+%282009%2C+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90a8bbf2b9fb36509e0cf1a6cda44d9585f737dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,168,187,242,185,251,54,80,158,12,241,166,205,164,77,149,133,247,55,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
