The pdf files are all (except for Outler) new scans, and all are searchable.\n\nIncludes versions by the following translators (with date of original publication in parentheses):\n\nF. J. Sheed (1943)\nAlbert Outler (1955)\nJohn K. Ryan (1960)\nR. S. Pine-Coffin (1961)\nRex Warner (1963)\nHenry Chadwick (1992)\nMaria Boulding (1997)\nPhilip Burton (2001)\nGarry Wills (2006)\n\nIf you're wondering which one to read, I would suggest Maria Boulding, but most of these translations have admirers. However, I've seen the Pine-Coffin version, despite being the most popular (due to the fact that it's a Penguin), criticized for inaccuracy. Wills' version is surprising and radically different from any other version I've seen. Sheed seems to capture Augustine's rhetorical passion best. Chadwick has been very widely praised for its accuracy and helpful notes and \nintroduction.\n\nIf you import the books into calibre (Add books --&gt; One book per directory), you'll get the cover images and metadata all at once.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee8ee06265dac7ca82bca3188790c29cb2564e3","amp;dn":"St.+Augustine+-+Confessions+%289+versions%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee8ee06265dac7ca82bca3188790c29cb2564e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,232,238,6,38,93,172,124,168,43,202,49,136,121,12,41,203,37,100,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
