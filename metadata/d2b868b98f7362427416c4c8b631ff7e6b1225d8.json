At the age of 13, he formed his first band, the Shepherds, which also included the son of Third World's Cat Coore and the daughter of Freddie McGregor; the group even opened up the 1992 Reggae Sunsplash festival. By 1994, Damian was working on his own solo project, and with the help of his father's label, Tuff Gong, he recorded Mr. Marley. Also lending a familial air to the sessions was the presence of Stephen Marley, who produced and co-wrote several songs for the LP. Halfway Tree from 2001 earned a Grammy nomination, but the public generally overlooked the ambitious album. Not so for the reggae-meets-hip-hop single &quot;Welcome to Jamrock,&quot; which became an urban phenomenon soon after its summer 2005 release. Street-level mixtapes began featuring it, urban radio couldn't get enough of it, and remixes -- both legal and not so legal -- began appearing at a fast pace. The well-rounded album Welcome to Jamrock delivered on the promise of the single that same year, reaching the Top Ten. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalfway Tree (2001)\n\n\n\n01.

Rahman. Formed around 2009 as a result of Stewart and Jagger's mutual love for Indian orchestral music as well as the music Stewart heard in his adopted home of St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, SuperHeavy began experimenting on tracks backed by Marley's touring rhythm section. In 2011, SuperHeavy released their debut self-titled album, featuring the reggae single &quot;Miracle Worker&quot; and the Rahman-composed cut &quot;Satyameva Jayathe.&quot; \n\n\nSuperheavy (2011)\n\n\n01.
