Renowned philosopher Daniel Dennett emphatically answers Ã¢â‚¬Å“yes!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Using an array of provocative formulations, Dennett sets out to show how we alone among the animals have evolved minds that give us free will and morality. Weaving a richly detailed narrative, Dennett explains in a series of strikingly original argumentsÃ¢â‚¬â€drawing upon evolutionary biology, cognitive  neuroscience, economics, and philosophyÃ¢â‚¬â€that far from being an enemy of traditional explorations of freedom, morality, and meaning, the evolutionary perspective can be an indispensable ally. In Freedom Evolves, Dennett seeks to place ethics on the foundation it deserves: a realistic, naturalistic, potentially unified vision of our place in nature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4877c5486ca59a3b56f4a7ec56fdabb907cfd32","amp;dn":"Freedom+evolves+-+Daniel+C.+Dennett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4877c5486ca59a3b56f4a7ec56fdabb907cfd32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,135,124,84,134,202,89,163,181,111,74,126,197,111,218,187,144,124,253,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
