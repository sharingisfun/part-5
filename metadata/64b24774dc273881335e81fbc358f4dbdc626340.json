Lee Thompson\n\nNotes:\n\n - In my humble opinion, it's underrated; worth at least 7.5, perhaps 8 or more. Stellar cast, gorgeous sets and costumes (by no less than Edith Head), great performances including choreography, so well-filmed it looks new, and some good writing. Classic.\n\n  - To use the subtitles, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/\n \n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64b24774dc273881335e81fbc358f4dbdc626340","amp;dn":"What+a+Way++to+Go%21.%281964%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64b24774dc273881335e81fbc358f4dbdc626340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,178,71,116,220,39,56,129,51,94,129,251,195,88,244,219,220,98,99,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
