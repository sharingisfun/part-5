Age and frailty have seen the twice-widowed great-grandmother lose the ability to tend her once beautiful front and back gardens - so they have become neglected sad no-go areas After Alan surprises her at an over 80's Tea Dance at the Darby and Joan, the team cleverly transform her front and back gardens into spaces she can safely garden again. They create two colourful and nostalgic havens full of thoughtful memories and even an outdoor ballroom where she enjoys a waltz with Alan.\r\n\r\n2)  Nottingham \r\nAlan Titchmarsh and the team create a new garden for an eight-year-old girl in Nottingham, despite the worst weather they have ever experienced. Tilly Sawford was severely scalded in a freak accident six years ago and continues to require treatment to aid her recovery, leading to the staff at her local hospital recommending the family have a safe garden created for them, with a bold colour scheme and surprise areas for all of the children.\r\n\r\n3)  Canterbury \r\nAlan and his team visit Canterbury to help Gurkha Hari Budha Magar, who lost the use of both his legs in Afghanistan in an IED incident. Though Hari thinks nothing of going out of his way to help others, his own garden is a challenge he has to yet to overcome, so the team transform his overlooked plot into a colourful private sanctuary, and there is a surprise appearance by Joanna Lumley.\r\n\r\n4)  Bolton \r\nAlan Titchmarsh and the team head to Bolton to surprise a 39-year-old RSPCA officer and turn her wasteland of a garden into a spectacular animal-friendly haven. Owner Caroline Hall suffered a near-fatal spinal stroke which turned her life upside down, and her once-beloved garden has become an inaccessible wilderness, but with a clever design and some top tips, the team create an area that Caroline is not only free to move around in, but one she absolutely falls in love with.\r\n\r\n5)  Eastleigh \r\nAlan Titchmarsh and his team visit Eastleigh, near Southampton, to transform an uneven patch of lawn into a cruise ship-inspired pleasure garden complete with a patio shaped like the prow of a boat. The project is intended as a `thank-you' to paediatric nurse Rosie Mitchell, whose nominees claim she has gone above and beyond the call of duty for 30 years in support of her young patients.\r\n\r\n6)  Durham \r\nWhen 39-year-old Durham dad Philip Hunter discovered he had terminal cancer, he got in touch with Alan Titchmarsh and his team to build a special garden for him, his wife Sam and two boys, Ethan and Josh to enjoy in his final years. However, when tragedy strikes earlier than expected, Alan and his colleagues do their best to create the garden Philip would have wanted. By using some clever design, the team fills the modestly sized plot with elegant features and details, but will the family like the result?\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b0/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4b/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ef/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Love-Your-Garden-Series-6-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: 1891 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1024 x 576\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 673 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/dzcz9v/love-your-garden--series-6-episode-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b8594e605bde86b41abe8fdece347e6ed1ef7f1","amp;dn":"ITV+Love+Your+Garden+Series+6+2of6+Nottingham+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b8594e605bde86b41abe8fdece347e6ed1ef7f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,133,148,230,5,189,232,107,65,171,232,253,236,227,71,230,237,30,247,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
