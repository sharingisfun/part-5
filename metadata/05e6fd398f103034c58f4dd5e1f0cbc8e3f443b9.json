The required software is provided by way of the freeware mathematical library BzzMath that is developed and maintained by the authors. The present volume focuses on optimization and nonlinear systems solution. The book describes numerical methods, innovative techniques and strategies that are all implemented in a well-established, freeware library. Each of these handy guides enables the reader to use and implement standard numerical tools for their work, explaining the theory behind the various functions and problem solvers, and showcasing applications in diverse scientific and engineering fields. Numerous examples, sample codes, programs and applications are proposed and discussed. The book teaches engineers and scientists how to use the latest and most powerful numerical methods for their daily work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05e6fd398f103034c58f4dd5e1f0cbc8e3f443b9","amp;dn":"Nonlinear+Systems+and+Optimization+for+the+Chemical+Engineer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05e6fd398f103034c58f4dd5e1f0cbc8e3f443b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,230,253,57,143,16,48,52,197,143,77,213,225,240,203,200,227,244,67,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
