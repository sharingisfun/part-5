Professor Frederick Shaffer believed that the people of Ugarit, a town in Syria that existed during the PharoahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reign, had buried a treasure before they were wiped out by the Pharoahs. Jack Hunter is one of the few archaeologists in the world who can interpret Ugarit writings, however he never bought FrederickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s belief of a hidden treasure. Before he was killed, Frederick had discovered a clue that would prove his theory was true. We follow Jack to Syria where he meets Nadia Ramadan (Joanne Kelly) the Ministry of Archaeology for Syria. Nadia thinks Jack is only coming to Syria to steal their historical artifacts and sell them to the highest bidder. She and her co-worker Tariq Khaliff (Mario Bassill) accompany Jack Hunter on his quest to find who killed Professor Frederick. During their travels, Jack discovers that the treasure is in fact real. Jack, Nadia and Tariq are caught up in a chase thru Syria, Egypt and Turkey trying to find the lost Treasure of Ugarit before Albert Littman (Thure Riefenstein) gets it for himself and the Russian mafia.\n\nRelease Name: Jack.Hunter.The.Lost.Treasure.Of.Ugarit.2008.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: XviD-1.1.2 | 830 kbps | 640 x 352 | 23.976 fps\nAudio: MP3 VBR Stereo | 152 kbps\nRuntime: 98 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3705522a703d70bfa1130cedb4b3edd1d46d16dd","amp;dn":"Jack.Hunter.The.Lost.Treasure.Of.Ugarit.2008.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3705522a703d70bfa1130cedb4b3edd1d46d16dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,5,82,42,112,61,112,191,161,19,12,237,180,179,237,209,212,109,22,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
