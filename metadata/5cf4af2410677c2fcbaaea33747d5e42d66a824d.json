His third solo album, it includes the hit singles &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot;, as well as songs such as &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot; and the title track that were turned down by Harrison's former band, the Beatles. The album reflects the influence of his musical activities outside the Beatles during 1968Ã¢â‚¬â€œ70, with Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Billy Preston and others, and Harrison's growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. All Things Must Pass introduced Harrison's signature sound, the slide guitar, and the spiritual themes that would be present throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams, titled Apple Jam. Commentators interpret Barry Feinstein's album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cf4af2410677c2fcbaaea33747d5e42d66a824d","amp;dn":"George+Harrison+-+All+Things+Must+Pass+2015+HD+Tracks+96-24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cf4af2410677c2fcbaaea33747d5e42d66a824d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,244,175,36,16,103,124,47,203,170,234,51,116,125,94,66,214,106,130,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
