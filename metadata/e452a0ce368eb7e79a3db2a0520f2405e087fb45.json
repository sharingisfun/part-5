The band's first two albums had a strong southern rock influence. By the early 1980s, 38 Special shifted to a more accessible arena rock style without abandoning its southern rock roots. This shift helped to usher in a string of successful albums and singles.\n\nTheir breakthrough hit was &quot;Hold On Loosely&quot; (1981). &quot;Caught Up in You&quot; (1982) and &quot;If I'd Been the One&quot; (1983) both hit No. 1 on Billboard magazine's Album Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Back Where You Belong&quot; (1984) continued the annual sequence of radio favorites. In 1985 they had another hit with &quot;Teacher Teacher&quot;, written by Jim Vallance and Bryan Adams. The song climbed to #4 on the Billboard Top Tracks Chart, spending 10 weeks on the chart. &quot;Second Chance&quot; was a No. 1 hit on Billboard's adult contemporary chart in 1989, followed by The Sound of Your Voice in 1991 (Billboard Hot 100 #33) from 'Bone Against Steel' and 'Fade to Blue' from the album 'Resolution' made it to #33 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 1997.\n\nIn 2007, 38 Special was the opening act on Lynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams Jr.'s Rowdy Frynds Tour, and on September 27, 2008, they filmed a CMT Crossroads special with country singer Trace Adkins, performing both artists' hits from over the years. In 2009, 38 Special opened for REO Speedwagon and Styx as part of the &quot;Can't Stop Rockin' Tour.&quot;\n\nAs of 2011, the lineup consists of Don Barnes, Donnie Van Zant, guitarist Danny Chauncey, bassist Larry Junstrom, keyboardist Bobby Capps and drummer Gary Moffatt. According to 38 Special's website, Van Zant has not toured with the band since 2012 due to health issues related to inner-ear nerve damage, although he will write and record with the band. Co-lead vocalist Barnes is now performing most of the vocals at concert appearances.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e452a0ce368eb7e79a3db2a0520f2405e087fb45","amp;dn":"38+Special+-+The+Very+Best+Of+The+A%26amp%3BM+Years+%5B2003%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e452a0ce368eb7e79a3db2a0520f2405e087fb45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,82,160,206,54,142,183,231,154,61,178,160,82,15,36,5,224,135,251,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
