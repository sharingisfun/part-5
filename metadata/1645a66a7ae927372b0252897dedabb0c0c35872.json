It is formed by nine (9) interlocking triangles that surround and radiate outward from a central point, symbolic of the junction between the physical universe and its unmanifest Source. The nine (9) triangles, arranged very specifically and superimposed on top of one another, are symbolic of male/female attributes.\n\nThe Birth of the Sonic Sri Yantra\n\nDr. Jeffrey Thompson translated this ancient Mandala symbol to offer all an opportunity to experience and use the energy and benefits which result from meditating on this sacred symbol. The mathematical reproduction of this Mandala produced an extremely complex pattern of relationships, the exact relationships you see as you look at the Sri Yantra Mandala pattern visually. This Audio Program is the sonic equivalent of the beautiful Sri Yantra viewed visually.\n\nDebut\n\nThis program first debuted in 1994 at a &quot;Seduction of Spirit&quot; workshop in San Diego, California. Visual images of the Sri Yantra and its corresponding sound frequencies formed a 45-minute meditation experience. This sound program is a very powerful tool for reaching deep states of consciousness. It, like so many of Dr. Thompson's creations, is a Masterpiece of Art and Science.\n\nHow to Use\n\nThe sounds of this program have been processed with special 3-D recording techniques, so headphones or good stereo separation are essential for best results. Sitting in a meditation posture with an erect spine, eyes closed and lights dimmed is recommended. You may also listen to it while gazing at a picture of the Sri Yantra itself. One is then led upward with this Sonic Sri Yantra. You will feel the Sri Yantra begin as a sound vibration in your body and eventually exiting through the top of your head.\n\nPart 1 - 31.33\nPart 2 - 31.24\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSecure rip and both tracks AccurateRip verified.
