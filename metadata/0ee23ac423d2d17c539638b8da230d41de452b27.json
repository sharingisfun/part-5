Information architecture can help you find out how your users think about the world, and transition those lessons to your product. In this course, Chris Nodder teaches you how to perform card sort research to get information about user interactions, analyze the results, and create a validated information architecture plan. Then translate your plan into refined menus, content classification, and page layouts. Finally, test the success of your new structure with reverse card sorting and by monitoring feedback from server logs, site searches, and help desk calls.\nTopics include:\n\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWhat is information architecture?\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWhy do research?\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating and running a paper card sort\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRecruiting test participants\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAnalyzing paper card sort results\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRunning a computer-based card sort\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating abstract information architecture\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tValidating your plan with a reverse card sort\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tTranslating information architecture to navigation and layout\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWatching the server after you go live\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ee23ac423d2d17c539638b8da230d41de452b27","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Foundations+of+UX%3A+Information+Architecture+with+Chris+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ee23ac423d2d17c539638b8da230d41de452b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,226,58,196,35,210,209,124,83,150,56,184,218,35,13,65,222,69,43,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
