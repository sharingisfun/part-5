Bach - Die Kunst der Fuge (The Art of Fugue) - Scherchen &amp; CBC Toronto - Tahra, 1965\r\n\r\n* About the recording\r\nThis is a mythical recording of one of the most celebrated work by Bach! Scherchen has done many orchestral version of the Art of the Fugue, and is widely regarded as one of its the best performer. The first track is awesome: we can hear Scherchen (with his thick German accent) and his orchestra rehearsing, giving us very valuable insight both into the interpretation and the work itself. The sound is a bit disappointing, but warm enough to make the listening enjoyable for want of a clear one.\r\n\r\n* Technicals \r\nTotal duration - 02h 02m 26s\r\nAverage bitrate - 636 kbps\r\nEncoder - FLAC 1.3.1, lossless, compression level 5\r\n\r\n\r\n* Tracks\r\nDisc: 1\r\n  1.
