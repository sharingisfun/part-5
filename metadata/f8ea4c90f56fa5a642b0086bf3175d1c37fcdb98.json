Dianne Wiest, Loretta Devine, Richard Schiff and Laura Dern appear in supporting roles.\n\nJessie Nelson and Kristine Johnson, who co-wrote the screenplay, researched the issues facing adults with developmental disabilities by visiting the non-profit organization L.A. Goal (Greater Opportunities for the Advanced Living). They subsequently cast two actors with disabilities, Brad Silverman and Joe Rosenberg, in key roles.[2]\n\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Sean Penn).\n\nThe movie's title is named for the line &quot;I am Sam&quot; featured in the book Green Eggs and Ham, which is read in the movie. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Am Sam 2001\n\nI Am Sam is the soundtrack to the 2001 film I Am Sam. It was released on January 8, 2002 by V2 Records (see 2002 in music). The album contents are made up entirely of cover versions of songs by The Beatles, although originally it was intended to comprise the original recordings by the group. When Sean Penn was unable to obtain the rights to include the songs, he commissioned the artists featured on the album to record the versions released.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Two of Us&quot;, performed by Aimee Mann and Michael Penn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:30\n2.\t&quot;Blackbird&quot;, performed by Sarah McLachlan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:21\n3.\t&quot;Across the Universe&quot;, performed by Rufus Wainwright Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n4.\t&quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;, performed by The Wallflowers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:39\n5.\t&quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;, performed by Eddie Vedder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:09\n6.\t&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, performed by Ben Harper Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:26\n7.\t&quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;, performed by Sheryl Crow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:42\n8.\t&quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;, performed by Ben Folds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:41\n9.\t&quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;, performed by The Vines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:05\n10.\t&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;, performed by Stereophonics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n11.\t&quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, performed by The Black Crowes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n12.\t&quot;Julia&quot;, performed by Chocolate Genius Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:34\n13.\t&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, performed by Heather Nova Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:15\n14.\t&quot;Help!&quot;, performed by Howie Day Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n15.\t&quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, performed by Paul Westerberg Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n16.\t&quot;Revolution&quot;, performed by Grandaddy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:02\n17.\t&quot;Let It Be&quot;, performed by Nick Cave Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:30\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8ea4c90f56fa5a642b0086bf3175d1c37fcdb98","amp;dn":"I+Am+Sam+-+Soundtrack+2001+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8ea4c90f56fa5a642b0086bf3175d1c37fcdb98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,234,76,144,245,111,165,166,66,176,8,107,243,23,93,28,55,252,219,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
