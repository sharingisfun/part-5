And where is Kahlee Sanders, \nthe young scientist who mysteriously vanished from the base - hours \nbefore her colleagues were slaughtered?\n\nSanders is now the prime suspect, but finding her creates more problems \nfor Anderson than it solves. Partnered with a rogue alien agent he can't \ntrust and pursued by an assassin he can't escape, Anderson battles impossible \nodds on uncharted worlds to uncover a sinister conspiracy . . . one \nhe won't live to tell about. Or so the enemy thinks.\n\n\nDuration: 8:31:40\nEncoded At: 64Kbps\nRippeed By: quartet1977","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dcd557d56cd36a2b7a7264dbb3c96bd0659ccc5","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+-+Revelation+by+Drew+Karpyshyn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dcd557d56cd36a2b7a7264dbb3c96bd0659ccc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,205,85,125,86,205,54,162,183,167,38,77,187,60,150,189,6,89,204,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
