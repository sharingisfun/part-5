He is best known for his philosophy of dialogue, a form of existentialism centered on the distinction between the I-Thou relationship and the I-It relationship.\n\nBuber's appeal is vast -- not only is he renowned for his translations of the Hebrew Bible but also for his interpretation of Hasidism, his role in Zionism, and his writings in psychotherapy and political philosophy.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* BETWEEN MAN AND MAN (Routledge Classics, 2002).
