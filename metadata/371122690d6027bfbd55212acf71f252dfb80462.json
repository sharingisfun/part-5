The book explores all aspects of the process, including aesthetics, technology, and practicalities, in a clear, concise manner designed to provide the reader with a full working knowledge of lighting design. Color illustrations throughout demonstrate the real-world effects of the concepts presented, and the companion website offers video animations and exercises to better illuminate the art and science of lighting. The book addresses the considerations that should be a part of any designer's process, and provides thorough guidance on meeting the various demands with smarter design.\nLighting is an essential element of interior design, and despite its ubiquity, is difficult to truly master. A designer with a fundamental and conceptual understanding of light is empowered to create simple, typical spaces, or work intelligently with lighting consultants on more complex projects. Designing With Light contains special discussions on color, light, and health, as well as the latest information on energy efficient lighting, control systems, and other technologies. Topics include: * Physics, psychology, and perception of light * Current and future lighting technology * Communication, documentation, and the design process * Sustainability, daylighting, and energy efficiency\nThe book also contains an entire chapter on building and energy codes, as well as practical guidance on photometrics and calculations. Lighting can make or break an otherwise well-designed space, so designers need the background to be able to think intelligently about illumination factors during all stages of the process. With comprehensive coverage and thorough explanation, Designing With Light is a complete resource for students and professionals alike.\n\nAbout the Author\nJASON LIVINGSTON is principal of Studio T+L, an interdisciplinary studio of theatrical and architectural designers and consultants. Livingston also teaches lighting design at Parsons School of Design and Pratt Institute. \n\nCONTENTS\nPreface \nAcknowledgments \nAbout the Author \nChapter 1: The Lighting Design Profession \nChapter 2: Designing with Light \nChapter 3: What Is Light? \nChapter 4: How We See \nChapter 5: Light, Vision, and Psychology \nChapter 7: Lamps \nChapter 8: Color in Light \nChapter 9: Lighting Fixtures or Luminaires \nChapter 10: Daylighting \nChapter 11: Documenting the Design \nChapter 12: Lighting Controls \nChapter 13: Photometrics and Calculations \nChapter 14: Building and Energy Codes \nChapter 15: Sustainability \nChapter 16: Light and Health \nAppendix I: Lighting DesignÃ¢â‚¬â€œRelated Professional Organizations \nAppendix II: Lighting-Related Trade Publications\nGlossary \nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371122690d6027bfbd55212acf71f252dfb80462","amp;dn":"Designing+With+Light+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371122690d6027bfbd55212acf71f252dfb80462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,17,34,105,13,96,39,191,189,85,33,42,207,113,242,82,223,184,4,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
