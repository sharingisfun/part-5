After the high irony of Pavement and other Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90s standard bearers, indie rock began moving into more emotionally forthright territory. Oh, Inverted World is the sound of realizing thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to life than being a smart-aleck -- but also not being ready to open up completely. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Caring Is Creepy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sums up the typical indie response to emotional situations with its title alone, but it also introduces James Mercer's delicate, dryly witty take on that attitude. Hyper-literate lyrics like Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a luscious mix of words and tricksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ suggest someone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better with words than with feelings, yet MercerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high, wavering tones -- which are as awkward as they are beautiful -- prove otherwise. \n\n  Caring might be creepy, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to avoid; the rest of Oh, Inverted World chronicles this post-ironic vulnerability, wrapping it in jangly guitar pop that echoes the Kinks, Zombies, and Beach Boys. This may not be the most innovative sound, but it makes MercerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boy meets girl, boy runs away, boy comes back, girl runs away travails all the more familiar and relatable. And, of course, just how good the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs are canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be overlooked. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Know Your OnionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ practically jumps out of its skin, bursting with British Invasion riffs and angst that goes way beyond adolescence; Ã¢â‚¬Å“New SlangÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tempers a yearning that curdles into bitterness with a beautiful melody and a ghostly falsetto coda. \n\n  More importantly, all of Oh, Inverted WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs hang together in an immensely satisfying way. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Weird DivideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a backyard Pet Sounds: its winding melody channels that point in the summer when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too hot to care much about anything, punctuating it with percussion that evokes incessant sprinklers. An airy feel runs through the album, from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girl on the WingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s bird imagery and pristine harmonies to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girl Inform MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s giddiness to Ã¢â‚¬Å“One by One All DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s psychedelic coda. As things wind down, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your AlgebraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s spooky chamber pop and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Past and the PendingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s acoustic musing foreshadow the experiments the Shins undertook on later albums. Oh, Inverted World is so full of ideas and emotions, and so fully realized, that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to believe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just 33 minutes long. Whether or not the album lives up to the breathless Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll change your life!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ claims made about it in Garden State, the less ironic direction of 2000s indie begins here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7be0953bed7b787009fc227097fc7a0bbc2d1805","amp;dn":"The+Shins+-+Oh%2C+Inverted+World+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7be0953bed7b787009fc227097fc7a0bbc2d1805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,224,149,59,237,123,120,112,9,252,34,112,151,252,122,11,188,45,24,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
