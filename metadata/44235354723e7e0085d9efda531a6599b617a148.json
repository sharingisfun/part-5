On Barton Hollow, their studio debut as the Civil Wars, the two trace each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s melodies with close harmonies that never fail to lose their romance, even on breakup tunes like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFalling.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an organic, folk-pop sound not unlike the one made by the Swell Season, another boy/girl duo with a talent for making heartbreaking Americana. If the Civil Wars are AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s answer to that band, then ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoison &amp; WineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFalling Slowly.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ An aching, gorgeous tribute to a relationship on the rocks, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the few tracks to include more than an acoustic guitar, with some piano and soft drums also making their way into the mix. Even so, the focus remains on the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals, which are easily the best instruments on Barton Hollow. Those who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like rootsy ballads are in for some slim pickings, since Barton Hollow shines its brightest whenever the tempos slow, the lights dim, and the voices rise up. But the title track, with its outlaw lyrics and swanky Southern groove, is a nice change from the norm, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Got This FriendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ finds a balance between both camps. Good stuff. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/19/the-civil-wars/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44235354723e7e0085d9efda531a6599b617a148","amp;dn":"The+Civil+Wars...Barton+Hollow%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44235354723e7e0085d9efda531a6599b617a148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,35,83,84,114,62,126,0,133,217,239,218,83,26,101,153,182,23,161,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
