Lou Castel stars as Alessandro, an epileptic from a large family of similarly afflicted siblings, headed up by a blind matriarch (Liliana Gerace). The only healthy member of the family is Alessandro&amp;#039;s brother Augusto (Marino Mase), who wants to marry his girlfriend but refuses to saddle a bride with the enormous burden of helping to care for his ailing relatives. Sympathetic to Augusto&amp;#039;s plight, Alessandro decides to murder the rest of the family so as to set his brother free and assure him of an inheritance. After hurling his mother into a ravine and drowning his little brother, Alessandro returns home to suffer a seizure. Long hailed by critics and historians as an unjustly ignored film, I Pugni in Tasca (1965) was one of 15 titles selected by New York&amp;#039;s Museum of Modern Art for its &quot;Second Act&quot; retrospective of post-war Italian cinema in the spring of 2000.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : I Pugni in Tasca.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 896 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 48mn\n      Bit rate : 1146 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 7.26 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Italiano\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 48mn\n      Bit rate : 1078 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 352 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.203\n      StreamSize : 839 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 48mn\n      Bit rate : 63 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 49.3 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.96r\n      Encoding settings : CBR\n\nIMDB: tt0059619\n\nItalian audio, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil) subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb41c7f52eb30a7c494295b41f6457f70ee276ac","amp;dn":"Fists+in+the+Pocket+%28I+Pugni+in+Tasca%29+-+Marco+Bellocchio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb41c7f52eb30a7c494295b41f6457f70ee276ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,65,199,245,46,179,10,124,73,66,149,180,31,100,87,247,14,226,118,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
