Ray then heads to Lady Elliot Island, where he goes scuba diving on the coral reef in the hope of spotting manta rays.\r\n\r\n2)  Wetlands \r\nRay explores the country's wetlands by travelling to Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, one of the most remote regions of Australia, where he comes face to face with a giant saltwater crocodile and witnesses the ancient tradition of farming with fire.\r\n\r\n3)  Bush \r\nRay explores the Bush in the state of Victoria and tracks down two Australian icons - the kangaroo and the koala. He also canoes across a secret lake in search of the elusive duck-billed platypus, one of the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth.\r\n\r\n4)  Rainforest \r\nRay continues to explore the country's wildlife, weather and geography by travelling deep into the rainforest as he attempts to track down cassowaries and tree kangaroos, two of Australia's most elusive creatures.\r\n\r\n5)  Coast \r\nRay continues to explore the country's wildlife, weather and geography by travelling along the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, taking to the seas off the coast in search of species like the weedy sea dragon and encountering dolphins, penguins and fur seals.\r\n\r\n6)  Desert \r\nRay concludes his expedition with a visit to the desert. He flies past the Uluru monolith in a helicopter, before he camps under the stars and spotting a variety of marsupials, including the red kangaroo.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/57/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/Wild-Australia-with-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~3459 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 23mins\r\n * Framerate: 25fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 666 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/d48csh/wild-australia-with-ray-mears--s1-e1-reef","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1aea3d18f3e2690427378fee941858ef71924f","amp;dn":"Wild+Australia+With+Ray+Mears+Series+1+2of6+Wetlands+720p+x264+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1aea3d18f3e2690427378fee941858ef71924f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,26,234,61,24,243,226,105,4,39,55,143,238,148,24,88,239,113,146,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
