His chosen bunkered down in this underwater city and embraced genetic engineering before the city descended into pure anarchy. Power and greed have run amok and the city has succumbed to civil war. Now one lone man must navigate through this underwater hell on earth, to save the lives of those that need to be saved. The only question is who really deserves to survive this maniacal debacle of science gone mad.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdd19f6a2afd2bfd09d842f95983d2e2edf59eca","amp;dn":"BioShock+-+Rapture+-+John+Shirley.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdd19f6a2afd2bfd09d842f95983d2e2edf59eca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,209,159,106,42,253,43,253,9,216,66,249,89,131,210,226,237,245,158,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
