In a very short time it has become an overwhelming success and best seller because of its uniqueness and nonconformity to other gun books.\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“Art of Modern GunfightingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is really two books in one. It covers all the elements of the Pistol in great detail with accompanying photographs as well as the aspects of gunfighting as it relates to the modern day. The book is a result of 35 years of ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real life experience behind the gun. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Art of Modern GunfightingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ covers each of his 5 Officer involved shootings in detail and shares the lessons derived from each of these. The mechanics of gunfighting, the mindset, safety, deadly force and the experiences of others are also included. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Art of Modern GunfightingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides a solid, grounded, fundamental use of the pistol in an engaging and informative narrative.\n\nBrett shares her experiences of over 21 years training individuals from all walks of life, including a special section on training women.\n\nRetired. LAPD Chief Darryl Gates, who was the pioneer of the SWAT concept, wrote a foreward to the book and calls it Ã¢â‚¬Å“a must read for anyone using deadly forceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e0dea6154d573d8c738a3726ad80b069dcdbce","amp;dn":"The+Art+Of+Modern+Gunfighting+%28The+Pistol%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e0dea6154d573d8c738a3726ad80b069dcdbce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,224,222,166,21,77,87,61,140,115,138,55,38,173,128,176,105,220,219,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
