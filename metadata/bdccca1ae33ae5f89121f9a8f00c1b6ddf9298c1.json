Their name stems from Negroamaro, a wine produced in their native region, Salento. After years spent in the Italian alternative market, they became famous in 2007 thanks to the Festivalbar.\n\nNegramaro formed up in 1999 in Copertino, near Lecce. In the beginning, helped by live performances, they received good reviews. That improved when they met producer Caterina Caselli who taught them how to record music. In 2001 they won the Tim Tour and ended as finalists at the MTV Brand New Talent. Their first album, &quot;Negramaro&quot;, was released in 2003. The sound of the album was too alternative for the Italian public, so it didn't have much success. Two singles were released. They were minor hits: &quot;Mono&quot; and &quot;Solo&quot;.\n\nn 2004 Negramaro met Italian producer Corrado Rustici to work on a few songs. The collaboration between them spawned a brand new track, &quot;Scusa Se Non Piango&quot;, and thee remixes of previous songs: &quot;Es-Senza&quot;, &quot;Evidentemente&quot; and &quot;Come Sempre&quot;. The four tracks were added to the other songs from their first album to create &quot;000577&quot;, a new edition of their debut work. This new edition gave the band a more pop-rock feeling, which was more suitable for the Italian public. The 2004 version of &quot;Come Sempre&quot; was released as a single with better success of the previous ones, and was even chosen as the soundtrack to celebrate the 50th birthday of the Italian TV network RAI.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/4215/296760o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/4215/296760o.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1 - Scusa se non piango\n2 - Essenza\n3 - Come sempre\n4 - Evidentemente\n5 - Zanzare\n6 - Solo\n7 - Apnea\n8 - Genova\n9 - Mono\n10 - Si ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ fermato il tempo\n11 - K-money\n12 - Gommapiuma\n13 - Notturno","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdccca1ae33ae5f89121f9a8f00c1b6ddf9298c1","amp;dn":"Negramaro+-+000577+%5BMp3+192+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdccca1ae33ae5f89121f9a8f00c1b6ddf9298c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,204,202,26,227,58,229,248,145,33,249,168,240,12,27,109,223,146,152,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
