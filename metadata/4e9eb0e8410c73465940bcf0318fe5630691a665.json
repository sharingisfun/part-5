A rich and involving tale of the creative mind, the rigours of living under war and the nature of time itself.\r\nAlesandro grows up in Glaud, a fascist state constantly at war with a faceless opponent. His brother is sent off to war; his family is destroyed by grief. Occasionally he catches glimpses of islands in the far distance from the shore, and they feed into the music he composesâ€”music for which he is feted. His search from his brother brings him into contact with the military leadership and suddenly he is a fugitive on the runâ€”he seeks refuge on the islands and his endless travels take him through places and time, bringing him answers where he could not have foreseen them.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e9eb0e8410c73465940bcf0318fe5630691a665","amp;dn":"The+Gradual+-+Christopher+Priest+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e9eb0e8410c73465940bcf0318fe5630691a665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,158,176,232,65,12,115,70,89,64,188,240,49,143,229,99,6,145,166,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
