At its essence, marketing strategy planning is about figuring out how to do a superior job of satisfying customers. This author team takes that point of view seriously and believes in practicing what they preach. Instructors and students can trust that this new edition of Essentials of Marketing 13eÃ¢â‚¬â€œ and all of the other teaching and learning materials that accompany it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will satisfy every instructor and studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ needs.\n\nBuilding on Pioneering Strengths\n\nThis author team pioneered an innovative structureÃ¢â‚¬â€ using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“four PsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a managerial approachÃ¢â‚¬â€for the introductory marketing course. It quickly became one of the most widely used business textbooks ever published because it organized the best ideas about marketing so that readers could both understand and apply them. The unifying focus of these ideas is on how to make the marketing decisions that a manager must make in deciding what customers to target and how best to meet their needs. \n\nOver many editions of Basic Marketing and Essentials of Marketing, there have been constant changes in marketing management and the marketing environment. Some of the changes have been dramatic, and others have been subtle. As a result, the authors have made ongoing changes to the text to reflect marketingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best practices and ideas. \n\nWhat's different about Essentials of Marketing?\n\nThe success of this franchise is not the result of a single strengthÃ¢â‚¬â€or one long-lasting innovation. Other text books have adopted the four Ps framework and the Perreault author team has continuously improved the book. The textÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four Ps framework, managerial orientation, and strategy planning focus have proven to be foundational pillars that are remarkably robust for supporting new developments in the field and innovations in the text and package. \n\nEssentials of Marketing teaches students analytical abilities and how-to-do-it skills that prepare them for success. The author team has deliberately included a variety of examples, explanations, frameworks, models, classification systems, cases, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“how-to-do-itÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ techniques that relate to our overall framework for marketing strategy planning. Similarly, the Marketing Plan Coach on the text website helps students see how to create marketing plans. Taken together, these items speed the development of Ã¢â‚¬Å“marketing senseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and enable the student to analyze marketing situations and develop marketing plans in a confident and meaningful way. They are practical and they work.\nAs opposed to many other marketing text books, the authors emphasize careful integration of special topics. Some textbooks treat Ã¢â‚¬Å“specialÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ topicsÃ¢â‚¬â€like relationship marketing, international marketing, services marketing, marketing and the Internet, marketing for nonprofit organizations, marketing ethics, social issues, and business-to-business marketingÃ¢â‚¬â€in separate chapters. The authors deliberatively avoid doing that because they are convinced that treating such topics separately leads to an unfortunate compartmentalization of ideas.\nThe comprehensive package of materials gives instructors the flexibility to teach marketing their way- or for the student, the ability to learn marketing their way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5075c8e2f3d0a7a0fac3a6f806b3cb5a55ba53b8","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Marketing%2C+13E+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5075c8e2f3d0a7a0fac3a6f806b3cb5a55ba53b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,117,200,226,243,208,167,160,250,195,166,248,6,179,203,90,85,186,83,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
