When she gets hit by a car, she falls into a coma. For eight days she is asleep, but upon waking, she finds she has retrograde amnesia; she has retained all general knowledge but hasn't a clue as to who she is or what she's done with her life. Soon, Sam finds out she's been very, very cruel to those around her. Taking her amnesia as a sign that it's time for change, Sam sets about making up for what the old, evil Sam did, and tries to change her life and herself for the better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbbf244173925a87dafa690b678b7af552e70509","amp;dn":"Samantha+Who%3F+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbbf244173925a87dafa690b678b7af552e70509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,191,36,65,115,146,90,135,218,250,105,11,103,139,122,245,82,231,5,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
