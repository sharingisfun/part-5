Giving examples of what he regards as the ineffectual nature of institutionalized education, Illich posited self-directed education, supported by intentional social relations, in fluid informal arrangements:\n\n&quot;Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.&quot;\n\n-----\n\nMost of the books in this torrent are improved versions of the books posted here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9979600.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9979600.&lt;/a&gt; You can find many other files there that I haven't included here.\nMy thanks to the original uploader.\n\nThese are all in PDF format unless otherwise stated below.\n\n\nABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind (with Barry Sanders)\n\nCelebration of Awareness: A Call for Institutional Revolution\n\nDeschooling Socity (EPUB, MOBI)\n\nDisabling Professions (essays by Ivan Illich, Irving Kenneth Zola, John McKnight, Jonathan Caplan, Harley Shaiken)\n\nEnergy and Equity\n\nGender\n\nH2O and the Waters of Forgetfulness\n\nImprisoned in the Global Classroom\n\nIn the Mirror of the Past: Lectures and Addresses, 1978-1990 (EPUB, PDF)\n\nIn the Vineyard of the Text: A Commentary to Hugh's Didascalicon\n\nMedical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health\n\nThe Right to Useful Unemployment and Its Professional Enemies\n\nShadow Work\n\nTools for Conviviality\n\nToward a History of Needs\n\n\nabout Illich:\n\nThe Challenges of Ivan Illich - Lee Hoinacki &amp; Carl Mitcham, eds.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b44f5f4657f996533d5b7b58ecc51beb5c939da3","amp;dn":"Ivan+Illich+-+Social+Criticism+%2816+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b44f5f4657f996533d5b7b58ecc51beb5c939da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,79,95,70,87,249,150,83,61,91,123,88,236,197,27,235,92,147,157,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
