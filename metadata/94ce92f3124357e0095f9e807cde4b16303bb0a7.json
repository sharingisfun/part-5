Dinah Bellman is a young blind girl with minor psychic powers. Fifth-grade teacher Laurel Stevenson takes to watching over Dinah. Nick Hopewell is from England. Don Gaffney, a retired tool-and-die engineer. There is Rudy Warwick, a businessman. Albert Kaussner is a talented Jewish teen violinist. Bethany Simms is a teenager with drug problems. Rounding out the group is Bob Jenkins, a mystery author and Craig Toomy, an irritable investment banker on the verge of a psychotic breakdown. They realize only those sleeping are now left on the plane. Engle takes control and lands the plane in Bangor, Maine.\n\nThe airport is abandoned with no signs of life. There are no odors or electricity. Food and drinks are tasteless and fire simply sputters out. They soon hear 'radio static' in the distance. Craig believes it is 'Langoliers', monsters he had heard about as a child who go after those who waste time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videodetective.com/titledetails.aspx?PublishedID=803273&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videodetective.com/titledetails.aspx?PublishedID=803273&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPatricia Wettig ...
