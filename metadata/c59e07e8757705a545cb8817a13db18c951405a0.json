The group was formed in its current hometown of Chicago, Illinois originally consisting of three sisters.\n\nThe Emotions had gone through a number of record label changes before really hitting it big with their collaboration with Issac Hayes and then even bigger success with Maurice White of Earth Wind and Fire fame.\n\nWhile their last album was in the mid to later nineties (Boogie wonderland with Earth Wind and Fire), they still continue to perform and make appearances today. \n\nIncluded in this torrent I believe is every EMOTIONS album ever...I hope you all enjoy. Please keep the music alive by seeding forever, or as long as possible. Thank you\n\nAlbums Include:\n\n1969 Emotions - So I Can Love you\n1970 Emotions - Untouched\n1976 Emotions - Flowers\n1977 Emotions - Rejoice\n1977 Emotions - Sunshine\n1978 Emotions - Sunbeam\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59e07e8757705a545cb8817a13db18c951405a0","amp;dn":"THE+EMOTIONS+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59e07e8757705a545cb8817a13db18c951405a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,158,7,232,117,119,5,165,69,203,136,23,161,61,177,140,149,20,5,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
