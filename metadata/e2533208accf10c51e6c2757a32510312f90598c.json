Good candidates for aging are high-alcohol brews, bottle-conditioned beers with yeast in the bottle, barleywines, lambics, and winter ales. Patrick Dawson explains how to identify a cellar-worthy beer, how to plan and set up a beer cellar, what to look for when tasting vintage beers, and the fascinating science behind the aging process. He also includes a comprehensive buying guide to help you select already-aged beers (from the readily available to the tantalizingly rare) to enjoy as your own collection is aging.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my other Brewing Books, Zymurgy and BYO torrents\n                                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&lt;/a&gt;\t(NOTE: If TPB keeps changing domains (ie... .org to .sx to .se), you will have to change it yourselves to see my other torrents)\t \n\n\n***************************************\n\t\t\t\nAlways looking for new brewing books digital or otherwise.
