I do not have the Symphobia 1 library, so it's completely impossible for me to test this. I'm not sure what exactly you are supposed to do with these files either, but I'm sure one of the people in the comments will know (hint hint ;) ).\n\n\n\nTorrent Contents:\n==================\nInstaller (by SPiRIT)\nKontakt instrument files (.nk*)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e6b25e831626181fba0656d1507847282dbcb4","amp;dn":"Project+SAM+-+Symphobia+%28Installer+and+Instruments%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e6b25e831626181fba0656d1507847282dbcb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,230,178,94,131,22,38,24,31,186,6,86,209,80,120,71,40,45,188,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
