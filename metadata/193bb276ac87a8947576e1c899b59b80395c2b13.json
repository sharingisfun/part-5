Most of the earth's citizens live\r\nin poverty, on the edge of starvation, and with little technology and medical\r\ncare. The rich and powerful live on Elysium â€” a gigantic, terraformed space\r\nhabitat located in Earth's orbit. Elysium is technologically advanced; such\r\ntechnology includes Med-Bays: medical machines that can cure all diseases,\r\nreverse the aging process and regenerate new body parts. A long-running feud\r\nexists between the wealthy residents of Elysium and the citizens of Earth, who\r\nwant Elysian technology to cure their medical ailments.\r\n\r\nMax Da Costa (Matt Damon) a former car thief on parole lives in the ruins of\r\nLos Angeles, and works at an assembly line for Armadyne Corp, a company run by\r\nJohn Carlyle (William Fichtner) who originally designed Elysium, and now\r\nsupplies its weaponry as well as the robots that police Earth. During an\r\nindustrial accident at the factory, Max is trapped in a chamber and is hit by\r\na lethal dose of radiation. After being rescued he is informed that he has\r\nfive days to live before succumbing to radiation poisoning. Desperate for a\r\ncure, he and his friend Julio (Diego Luna) seek help from a human smuggler named\r\nSpider (Wagner Moura) to get him to Elysium; his only chance for survival is\r\nusing a Med-Bay.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $115,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $29,807,393 (USA) (9 August 2013)\r\nGross: $93,050,117 (USA) (22 November 2013)\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/63967040261541563672.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/28329210587887886582.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/80502569487315395189.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/76054879166504849466.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/38818826224668816553.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/10888941249630552953.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535108/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 8.82 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 11.5 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 01:49:35\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS\r\nAudio Bit rate: 1509 Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / Bit depth 24 bits\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels: 6 channels 5.1\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:193bb276ac87a8947576e1c899b59b80395c2b13","amp;dn":"Elysium+-+%5B2013%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"193bb276ac87a8947576e1c899b59b80395c2b13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,59,178,118,172,135,168,148,117,118,225,200,153,181,155,128,57,92,43,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
