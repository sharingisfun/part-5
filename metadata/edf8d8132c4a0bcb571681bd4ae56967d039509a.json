Her gritty and growling performances beat down doors everywhere, looking back to the double-barreled attack of gospel fervor and sexual abandon that had originally formed soul in the early '50s. Divorced from Ike in the mid-'70s, she recorded only occasionally later in the decade but resurfaced in the mid-'80s with a series of hit singles and movie appearances; her high-profile status was assured well into the '90s.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nDisc 1\n01.What's Love Got To Do With It\n02.Nutbush City Limits\n03.Let's Stay Together\n04.The Acid Queen (1994 Digital Remaster)\n05.River Deep, Mountain High\n06.Private Dancer (Single Edit)\n07.Help!\n08.Tonight\n09.Better Be Good To Me\n10.Show Some Respect\n11.I Can't Stand The Rain\n12.It's Only Love\n13.I Want To Take You Higher\n14.Get Back\n15.Come Together\n16.Proud Mary\n\nDisc 2\n01.The Best\n02.I Don't Wanna Lose You\n03.We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\n04.One Of The Living\n05.Addicted To Love (Live)\n06.Typical Male\n07.What You Get Is What You See\n08.Tearing Us Apart\n09.Steamy Windows\n10.Two People\n11.Break Every Rule\n12.Look Me In The Heart\n13.Be Tender With Me Baby\n14.Love Thing\n15.Way Of The World\n16.Nutbush City Limits (The 90's Version)\n\nDisc 3\n01.I Don't Wanna Fight (Single Edit)\n02.It Takes Two\n03.Goldeneye\n04.I Want You Near Me\n05.Why Must We Wait Until Tonight (7&quot; Edit)\n06.Whatever You Want\n07.On Silent Wings (Single Edit)\n08.Missing You\n09.Something Beautiful Remains\n10.In Your Wildest Dreams\n11.When The Heartache Is Over\n12.Whatever You Need (Edit)\n13.Open Arms\n14.It Would Be A Crime\n15.I'm Ready\n16.Cose Della Vita\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf8d8132c4a0bcb571681bd4ae56967d039509a","amp;dn":"Tina+Turner+-+The+Platinum+Collection+%282009%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf8d8132c4a0bcb571681bd4ae56967d039509a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,248,216,19,44,74,11,203,87,22,129,189,74,229,105,103,208,57,80,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
