A relatively overlooked type of risk until it caused major unexpected losses during the financial crisis of 2007 through 2009, correlation risk has become a major focus of the risk management departments in major financial institutions, particularly since Basel III specifically addressed correlation risk with new regulations. This offers a rigorous explanation of the topic, revealing new and updated approaches to modelling and risk managing correlation risk.\n\n-Offers comprehensive coverage of a topic of increasing importance in the financial world\n-Includes the Basel III correlation framework\n-Features interactive models in Excel/VBA, an accompanying website with further materials, and problems and questions at the end of each chapter\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface xiii\n\nAcknowledgments xvii\n\nAbout the Author xix\n\nCHAPTER 1\nSome Correlation Basics: Properties, Motivation, Terminology 1\n\n1.1 What Are Financial Correlations? 1\n\n1.2 What Is Financial Correlation Risk? 2\n\n1.3 Motivation: Correlations and Correlation Risk Are Everywhere in Finance 5\n\n1.4 How Does Correlation Risk Fit into the Broader Picture of Risks in Finance? 24\n\n1.5 A Word on Terminology 33\n\n1.6 Summary 34\n\nAppendix 1A: Dependence and Correlation 35\n\nDependence 35\n\nCorrelation 36\n\nIndependence and Uncorrelatedness 37\n\nAppendix 1B: On Percentage and Logarithmic Changes 38\n\nPractice Questions and Problems 39\n\nReferences and Suggested Readings 40\n\nCHAPTER 2\nEmpirical Properties of Correlation: How Do Correlations Behave in the Real World? 43\n\n2.1 How Do Equity Correlations Behave in a Recession, Normal Economic Period, or Strong Expansion? 43\n\n2.2 Do Equity Correlations Exhibit Mean Reversion? 46\n\n2.3 Do Equity Correlations Exhibit Autocorrelation? 50\n\n2.4 How Are Equity Correlations Distributed? 51\n\n2.5 Is Equity Correlation Volatility an Indicator for Future Recessions? 52\n\n2.6 Properties of Bond Correlations and Default Probability Correlations 53\n\n2.7 Summary 54\n\nPractice Questions and Problems 55\n\nReferences and Suggested Readings 55\n\nCHAPTER 3\nStatistical Correlation ModelsÃ¢â‚¬â€Can We Apply Them to Finance? 57\n\n3.1 AWord on Financial Models 57\n\n3.2 Statistical Correlation Measures 60\n\n3.3 Should We Apply SpearmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rank Correlation and KendallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s t in Finance? 65\n\n3.4 Summary 66\n\nPractice Questions and Problems 67\n\nReferences and Suggested Readings 68\n\nCHAPTER 4\nFinancial Correlation ModelingÃ¢â‚¬â€Bottom-Up Approaches 69\n\n4.1 Correlating Brownian Motions (Heston 1993) 69\n\n4.2 The Binomial CorrelationMeasure 72\n\n4.3 Copula Correlations 74\n\n4.4 Contagion Correlation Models 88\n\n4.5 Summary 90\n\nAppendix 4A: Cholesky Decomposition 91\n\nExample: Cholesky Decomposition for Three Assets 92\n\nAppendix 4B: A Short Proof of the Gaussian Default\n\nTime Copula 93\n\nPractice Questions and Problems 93\n\nReferences and Suggested Readings 94\n\nCHAPTER 5\nValuing CDOs with the Gaussian CopulaÃ¢â‚¬â€What Went Wrong? 101\n\n5.1 CDO BasicsÃ¢â‚¬â€What Is a CDO?
