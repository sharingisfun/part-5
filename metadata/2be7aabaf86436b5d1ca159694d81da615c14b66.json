Allende, whose works sometimes contain aspects of the &quot;magic realist&quot; tradition, is famous for novels such as The House of the Spirits (La casa de los espÃƒÂ­ritus, 1982) and City of the Beasts (La ciudad de las bestias, 2002), which have been commercially successful. Allende has been called &quot;the world's most widely read Spanish-language author&quot;. In 2004, Allende was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 2010, she received Chile's National Literature Prize. President Barack Obama awarded her the 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\n\nAllende's novels are often based upon her personal experience and pay homage to the lives of women, while weaving together elements of myth and realism. She has lectured and toured many American colleges to teach literature. Fluent in English as a second language, Allende was granted American citizenship in 1993, having lived in California with her American husband since 1989","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2be7aabaf86436b5d1ca159694d81da615c14b66","amp;dn":"Isabel+Allende+-+14+Novels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2be7aabaf86436b5d1ca159694d81da615c14b66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,231,170,186,248,100,54,181,209,202,21,150,148,216,29,166,21,193,75,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
