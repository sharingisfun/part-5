It is a free program that allows you to take video and audio files and convert them into MKV files on the fly, making it a very quick conversion.\n\nOpen MKVMerge on your computer, and you will be greeted by its home menu. Click the &quot;Add&quot; button that is near the top of the program, and a new window will appear giving you access to your computer's files. Locate your MP4 video files and select them. Press &quot;Open,&quot; and it will load into MKVMerge.\n\nPress the &quot;Browse&quot; button at the bottom of the program, and a window will appear. Locate a place on your computer to save the new MKV file after it is created. Once you have found a place, click &quot;Save&quot; to save the location. Click the &quot;Start Muxing&quot; button at the bottom of the program and your MKV file will be created. Depending on the size of the file, it could take a few minutes. Once it is finished locate the MKV file after the program congratulates you on the conversion and play it as you would any other video file.\n\nTo ensure that you can get proper MKV playback after the mkv conversion be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback.
