But Waller made an indelible enough impression for Satchmo to record the tribute album Satch Plays Fats: The Music of Fats Waller in 1955, when such ideas were new. The nine tracks feature Armstrong ably supported by his All-Stars on such classics as &quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; &quot;Squeeze Me,&quot; and &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'.&quot; The mid-'50s was a fertile time for Armstrong, and this makes for a stellar package. [Some reissues deliver over twice the tracks of the original LP issue, with four edited alternate takes from the same session, plus seven more tracks of Waller material recorded by Armstrong in the 1920s and '30s.]\n\n\nTracks:\n1.
