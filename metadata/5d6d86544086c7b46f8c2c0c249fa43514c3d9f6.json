So to combat this crazy pricing, I've decided to upload a personal copy of mine complete with full artwork. So you can make it look just like the real thing and annoy the price gougers to boot ;)\n\nCD was ripped using Exact Audio Copy in high quality MP3 format. If I get enough requests, I will try to upload it in different formats.\n\nCD Description:\nWhen I Met You is a 2 Many DJs-style mix by Australia's The Avalanches.
