The pages of this book are transcripts of the testimony of mute witnesses, the rocks, in the court of celestial traffic. They testify by their own appearance and by the encased contents of dead bodies, fossilized skeletons. Myriads upon myriads of living creatures came to life on this ball of rock suspended in nothing and returned to dust. Many died a natural death, many were killed in wars between races and species, and many were entombed alive during great paroxysms of nature in which land and sea contested in destruction. Whole tribes of fish that had filled the oceans suddenly ceased to exist; of entire species and even genera of land animals not a single survivor was left. [..]&quot; \n\n    &quot;I had intended, after piecing together the history of these earlier global upheavals, to present geological and paleontological material to support the testimony of man. But the reception of Worlds in Collision by certain scientific groups persuaded me, before reviving the pageant of earlier catastrophes, to present at least some of the evidence of the rocks, which is as insistent as that carried down to our times by written records and by word of mouth.[..]&quot; \n\n    &quot;I present here some pages from the book of nature. I have excluded from them all references to ancient literature, traditions, and folklore; and this I have done with intent, so that careless critics cannot decry the entire work as &quot;tales and legends.&quot; Stones and bones are the only witnesss.&quot;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImmanuel Velikovsky - Worlds in Collision &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4999668&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4999668&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy public URL: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy RSS feed: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34af1531fa954f97f2a7d8a6c06b501b135656f7","amp;dn":"Immanuel+Velikovsky+-+Earth+in+Upheaval+-+Ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34af1531fa954f97f2a7d8a6c06b501b135656f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,175,21,49,250,149,79,151,242,167,216,166,192,107,80,27,19,86,86,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
