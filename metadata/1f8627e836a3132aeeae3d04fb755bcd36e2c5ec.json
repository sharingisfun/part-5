It is an underground movement of secret freedom fighters, each acting individually and independently to ignore, evade, resist and thwart the increasingly heavy hand of government power. Invisible resisters do not join protest groups, stand on street corners making speeches or run with a mob throwing rocks at police vehicles. Rather, they make up a collective silent insurgency that tyrants won't be able to put down because they won't be able to find it. Government enforcers will fruitlessly look for organizations with no members, commanders who aren't there, secret headquarters that don't exist and couriers that carry no messages. Invisible Resistance to Tyranny is both a manifesto and manual for everyday citizens who are alarmed by the never-ending encroachment upon the individual freedoms recognized by the Bill of Rights and who want to do something about it now before it comes down to a choice between violent revolution and total submission. It outlines a progressive program of resistance that anyone can undertake without having to protest in the streets, go on hunger strikes or take up arms. It tells how to:\nbe a &quot;bad&quot; citizen while still being a good neighbor.\nidentify and nurture sympathizers and build a network of invisible resisters.\nconfront and convert &quot;government supremacists&quot; to your side.\ndisrespect politicians and bureaucrats without drawing attention to yourself.\nactively resist within today's system through such avenues as taxes, guns, juries and schools.\nIt then provides ideas for the many paths of invisible resistance to tyranny - intelligence collection and dissemination, propaganda, support for active operations and, if it should ever come down to it, direct operations against a totalitarian regime.\n\nPaperback: 152 pages\nPublisher: Paladin Press; 1st edition (March 1, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1581603088\nISBN-13: 978-1581603088\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Resistance-Tyranny-Insurgency-Increasingly/dp/1581603088/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372469517&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Invisible+Resistance+To+Tyranny%3A+How+to+Lead+a+Secret+Life+of+Insurgency+in+an+Increasingly+Unfree+World&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Resistance-Tyranny-Insurgency-Increasingly/dp/1581603088/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372469517&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Invisible+Resistance+To+Tyranny%3A+How+to+Lead+a+Secret+Life+of+Insurgency+in+an+Increasingly+Unfree+World&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nanAHaaei&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nanAHaaei&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f8627e836a3132aeeae3d04fb755bcd36e2c5ec","amp;dn":"Invisible+Resistance+To+Tyranny%3A+How+to+Lead+a+Secret+Life+of+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f8627e836a3132aeeae3d04fb755bcd36e2c5ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,134,39,232,54,163,19,42,238,174,61,4,251,117,91,205,54,226,197,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
