Together with reconstructions, key interviews and archive material these programmes examine the crime and the criminal, revealing how the fall-out from the cases led to significant changes in British law.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Harold Shipman \nDr Harold Shipman is one of the World's biggest serial killers. In 2000 he was convicted of murdering 215 patients by lethal injection. For over 20 years this general practitioner worked under the guise of a kind, caring man of the community. Whilst fooling his family, colleagues and patients he preyed on those who trusted them the most and killed them with an injection of diamorphine. Such a trusted pillar of the community, Shipman, went unquestioned for years killing men and women in the small town of Hyde, in the UK. His cover was eventually blown when he tried to forge one victims will. The true devastation unravelled revealing the doctor to be one of the world's biggest single serial killers of all time. Shipman never revealed his motive and committed suicide in prison in 2004. This film documents Shipman's horrendous crimes told by the people who were affected by his crimes. Danny Mellor's mother was murdered by the GP. Danny and other relatives were shocked. She was in good health just days before. Lesley Creasey's Auntie was killed by Shipman after a routine visit to her house. She appeared fit and well to neighbours just hours before. Dr Raj Patel worked across the road from Shipman countersigning death certificates for years. His detective work along with his colleagues helped bring the murderer to justice. Debbie Massey is an undertaker who worked with Shipman. Her suspicions helped to raise the alarm.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/266/crimesthatshookbritainsz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/266/crimesthatshookbritainsz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/1790/crimesthatshookbritains.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1979 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 47mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crimes-that-shook-britain-the-russell-murders-825294&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crimes-that-shook-britain-the-russell-murders-825294&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a81e121b88273be450e1c0a7cfdb59d3f12e46","amp;dn":"History+Ch+Crimes+That+Shook+Britain+3of6+Harold+Shipman+XviD+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a81e121b88273be450e1c0a7cfdb59d3f12e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,168,30,18,27,136,39,59,228,80,225,192,167,207,219,89,211,241,46,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
