Tools that may cost extra in other professional 3D applications are part of the product package, including 999 free cross-platform render nodes, support for Windows and Mac UB 64 and 32-bit operating systems, free technical support and more. LightWave is enjoyed worldwide, as a complete 3D production solution for feature film and television visual effects, broadcast design, print graphics, visualization, game development, and Web. LightWave is responsible for more artists winning Emmy Awards than any other 3D application.\n\nMajor Studios and Post-Production Houses spend years assembling their custom pipelines, often at great expense and requiring large numbers of technical staff to maintain. Those complex pipelines are perfect for companies with hundreds of employees, but can be overkill for the majority of studios around the world with 40 employees or less.\n\nLightWave fits seamlessly into large multi-software pipelines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with its powerful interchange tools including FBX, ZBrush GoZ, Collada, Unity Game Engine Support, and Autodesk Geometry Cache. Unlike other software packages, LightWave offers artists and studios a complete end-to-end solution right out of the box. Robust polygonal and subdivision surface modeling, unique. Interchangeable layered and nodal texturing, along with powerful dedicated node material shaders. Powerful animation and rigging tools. Eye-popping volumetric and dynamic effects systems. A production proven, award-winning Global Illumination render engine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ built in. You decide what workflow or pipeline suits you best and LightWave puts all of the tools in your hands.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4061c7b2c0da89e011a1b8135c58e22f46e643","amp;dn":"NEWTEK+LIGHTWAVE+3D+11.6.2+MAC+OSX+XFORCE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4061c7b2c0da89e011a1b8135c58e22f46e643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,64,97,199,178,192,218,137,224,17,161,184,19,92,88,226,47,70,230,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
