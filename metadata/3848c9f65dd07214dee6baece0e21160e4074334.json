The Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have widely different views of Jesus.\n\nThe Judaism view considers Jesus a Jewish Rabbi, but rejects his messiahship. Also, most Jews consider him an imposter and one of many false messiahs who appeared throughout history.\n\nChristian views of Jesus center on the belief that Jesus is divine, is the Messiah whose coming was prophesied in the Old Testament, and that he was resurrected after his crucifixion. Christians predominantly believe that Jesus is the &quot;Son of God&quot;. While the doctrine of the Trinity is widely accepted by most Christians, several Christian groups reject the doctrine of the Trinity as non-scriptural, wholly or partly.\n\nThe Islamic view considers Jesus as a Prophet from God. All prophets are wise and pious humans chosen by God to carry His message to other people. Therefore, Jesus is neither divine nor the Son of God, but he is one of the six great prophets.\n\nThis upload contains 47 titles as follows:\n\n - 27  titles in the main directory that examine the different views of Jesus as presented in the writings circulating in the West.
