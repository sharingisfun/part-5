Genia SchÃƒÂ¶nbaumsfeld closes this gap and offers new readings of Kierkegaard's and Wittgenstein's conceptions of philosophy and religious belief.\n\nChapter one documents Kierkegaard's influence on Wittgenstein, while chapters two and three provide trenchant criticisms of two prominent attempts to compare the two thinkers, those by D. Z. Phillips and James Conant. In chapter four, SchÃƒÂ¶nbaumsfeld develops Kierkegaard's and Wittgenstein's concerted criticisms of the &quot;spaceship view&quot; of religion and defends it against the common charges of &quot;fideism&quot; and &quot;irrationalism&quot;.\n\nAs well as contributing to contemporary debate about how to read Kierkegaard's and Wittgenstein's work, A Confusion of the Spheres addresses issues which not only concern scholars of Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard, but anyone interested in the philosophy of religion, or the ethical aspects of philosophical practice as such.&quot;\n\nThis torrent contains the original PDF, a scanned copy.
