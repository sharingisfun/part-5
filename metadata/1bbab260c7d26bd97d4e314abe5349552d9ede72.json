He was commander-in-chief of the greatest military power the world had known, and yet a man whose paralysis from polio made him powerless to accomplish even the most minor physical tasks. Few Americans knew the extent of his disability.\n\nIn this intimate biography set against the epic of World War Two, Reynolds reveals how Roosevelt was burdened by secrets about his failing health and strained marriage that, if exposed, could have destroyed his presidency. Enigmatic, secretive and with a complicated love life, America's wheelchair president was racing to shape the future before the past caught up with him.\n\nWeaving together the conduct of the war in Europe and the Pacific, the high politics of Roosevelt's diplomacy with Stalin and Churchill, and the entangled stories of the women who sustained the president in his last year, Reynolds explores the impact of Roosevelt's growing frailty on the war's endgame and the tainted peace that followed.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;347c5d535c7478001a05&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3089Kbps)\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.41 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 89 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.04 GB\nSource: HDTV\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bbab260c7d26bd97d4e314abe5349552d9ede72","amp;dn":"World.War.Two.1945.and.the.Wheelchair.President.720p.HDTV.x264-M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bbab260c7d26bd97d4e314abe5349552d9ede72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,186,178,96,199,210,107,217,125,78,49,74,190,83,73,85,45,158,222,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
