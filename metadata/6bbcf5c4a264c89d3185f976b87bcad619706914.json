The opening track, Billy Strayhorn's &quot;Chelsea Bridge,&quot; is lush and emotional and truly sets the tone for this album. With Jimmy Rowles on piano (his intro on &quot;Sunday&quot; sounds like a ragtimer like Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith just pushed him off the stool before the band came in), Mel Lewis on drums, and always superb Leroy Vinnegar on bass present and accounted for, the rhythm section is superbly swinging with just the right amount of bop lines and chords in the mix to spice things up. The ghost of Duke Ellington hovers over every note on this record (Billy Strayhorn was one of his main arrangers), and that is a very good thing indeed. There's a beautiful understated quality to the music on this session that makes it the perfect &quot;relaxing around the house on a rainy day&quot; disc to pop in the player. File this one under cool, very smooth, and supple.\n\nTracklist\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.&quot;In a Mellow Tone&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:20\n2.&quot;In a Mellow Tone (alternate take)&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n3.&quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:22\n4.&quot;Chelsea Bridge (original LP master take)&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:39\n5.&quot;Chelsea Bridge (alterate take)&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n6.&quot;Go Home (alternate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:01\n7.&quot;Go Home (original LP master take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:54\n8.&quot;Who's Got Rhythm?(original LP master take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:26\n9.&quot;For Bessie&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:38\n10.&quot;Go Home&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:44\n11.&quot;Go Home&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:30\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n1.&quot;Fajista (alternate take)&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n2.&quot;Fajista (alternate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:21\n3.&quot;Fajista (alternate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:37\n4.&quot;Fajista&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:58\n5.&quot;Tell Me When&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n6.&quot;Tell Me When (alternate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n7.&quot;Blues in B Flat (alternate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n8.&quot;Blues in B Flat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:38\n9.&quot;Blues in B Flat (alternate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:23\n10.&quot;The Catwalk (alternate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n11.&quot;The Catwalk (alternate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n12.&quot;The Catwalk (original LP master take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:13\n13.&quot;The Catwalk (alterate take)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:19\n14.&quot;Sunday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:32\n15.&quot;Sunday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:21\n\n\nPersonel\n[b]Mel Lewis Drums \nGerry Mulligan Sax (Baritone) \nJimmy Rowles Piano \nLeroy Vinnegar Bass \nBen Webster , Sax (Tenor)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bbcf5c4a264c89d3185f976b87bcad619706914","amp;dn":"Gerry+Mulligan+and+Ben+Webster+The+Complete+Gerry+Mulligan+Meets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bbcf5c4a264c89d3185f976b87bcad619706914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,188,245,196,162,100,200,157,49,133,249,118,184,123,202,214,25,112,105,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
