Before you even press play, you've understood three things about Dead Can Dance's first album in 16 years: it's erudite, portentous in its introspection, and finds a band whose back catalogue is a kind of musical world tour swimming around in the Aegean sea.\nIf Anastasis marks a return to the past, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more notable for marking the return of Dead Can Dance. Considering the bottomless well of territorial and spiritual inspiration the duo draw from, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no telling how far they could take this resurrection.\n\nDead Can Dance are:Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry\n\nTrack list :\n\n1. Children Of The Sun [7:33]\n2. Anabasis [6:51]\n3. Agape [6:54]\n4. Amnesia [6:37]\n5. Kiko [8:02]\n6. Opium [5:45]\n7. Return Of The She-King [7:51]\n8.
