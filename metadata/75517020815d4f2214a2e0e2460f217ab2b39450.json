With this book, you will find a true C++ text, rather than a book translated from Java. Both the programming code and the appropriate concepts have been rewritten.\n\nDATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IN C++ helps you develop a wide spectrum of valuable skills, ranging from sound algorithm and data structure design, to effective application of analysis techniques, to clean and efficient implementation and coding of design in C++. The authors' highly visual, applied approach and extensive suite of Web-based learning tools give you the opportunity to see visual justifications of key analytic concepts, learn about the most recent advances in the field, and actually do program design using data structures.\n\nFEATURES\nPresents a consistent object-oriented perspective.\nDesign patterns provide clear approaches for developing programs.\n&quot;Visual Proofs&quot; help you better understand complex analytic concepts.\nAnimations on the text's Web site visually illustrate data structures and algorithms.\nExercises offer numerous opportunities for hands-on learning at various level of rigor.\nThe author's exceptionally clear writing style helps you understand even the most difficult mathematical concepts.\nEmphasizes the practical application of the latest software engineering practices.\nWeb-based learning tools on the Companion Web Site www.wiley.com/college/goodrich include:\n- C++ code examples\n- Algorithm visualization tools that illustrate key concepts\n- Searchable database of additional exercises\n- A &quot;Hint Server&quot; that gives students help (but not answers) for problems in the text\n--This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 744 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 2 edition (February 22, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470383275\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470383278","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75517020815d4f2214a2e0e2460f217ab2b39450","amp;dn":"Data+Structures+and+Algorithms+in+C%2B%2B%2C2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75517020815d4f2214a2e0e2460f217ab2b39450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,81,112,32,129,93,79,34,20,162,224,226,70,15,33,122,178,179,148,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
