Some revisionists have tried to cast him as a sort of early blue-eyed soul figure, although he was probably more aligned with pop/rock, at first as the lead singer of the Belmonts, and then as a solo star. Drug problems slowed him down in the mid-'60s, yet he made some surprisingly interesting progressions into blues-rock and folk-rock as the decade wore on, culminating in a successful comeback in the late '60s, although he was unable to sustain its commercial and artistic momentum for long. \n\n\nGenre................: Oldies Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Repertoire\nIncluded.............: Covers, Lossless Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n\n01.The Wanderer\n02.A Teenager In Love\n03.Runaround Sue\n04.Where Or When\n05.Lonely Teenager\n06.I Wonder Why\n07.Lovers Who Wander\n08.No One Knows\n09.Little Diane\n10.Love Came To Me\n11.When You Wish Upon A Star\n12.Ruby Baby\n13.Donna The Prima Donna\n14.Drip Drop\n15.This Little Girl\n16.Sandy\n17.In The Still Of The Night\n18.Be Careful Of Stones That You Throw\n19.The Majestic\n20.Abraham, Martin And John\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15bf6bf0d4c31946fe129fd0054d16628460bcc4","amp;dn":"Dion+And+The+Belmonts+-+Greatest+Hits+%281999%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15bf6bf0d4c31946fe129fd0054d16628460bcc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,191,107,240,212,195,25,70,254,18,159,208,5,77,22,98,132,96,188,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
