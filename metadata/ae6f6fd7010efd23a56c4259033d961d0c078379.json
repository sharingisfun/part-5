They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste any time showing how much bigger and bolder they sound: the audacious opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Two CousinsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ pairs Charles Watson and Rebecca Taylor's twinned vocals with bright keyboards, adding a cheery tinge to plaintive concerns like Ã¢â‚¬Å“where your heart goes when you die.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They follow that with Ã¢â‚¬Å“If WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Still Alive,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is all call-and-response vocals and crashing rhythms that are anything but slow. Indeed, the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pop side really takes flight on Paradise, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the stomping Ã¢â‚¬Å“BeginnersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the full-on joyous Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Dog,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which boasts staccato guitars that recall the Walkmen at their boldest. Yet Watson and Taylor keep everything that made Yeah, So? such a special debut. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hackney MarshÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reaffirms how impressive the pairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harmonies are -- theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re complementary lead parts instead of a main and backing vocal -- with the intimacy of a live recording. Meanwhile, Watson gets close enough to break your heart on the cozy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Horses Jumping,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which moves from a simple acoustic ballad into something more expansive as he sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“good love is hard to regret/when you know it was real.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Though Slow Club can make rainy day music with the best of them, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always a silver lining to their songs, no matter how sad they get. A strangely reverent feel permeates the album, particularly the beautiful meditation on grief Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m WakingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the hidden title track, which feels like a more genuine version of Cults. Polished yet heartfelt, Paradise finds Slow Club shoring up their strengths and exploring new territory with equal confidence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae6f6fd7010efd23a56c4259033d961d0c078379","amp;dn":"Slow+Club+-+Paradise+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae6f6fd7010efd23a56c4259033d961d0c078379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,111,111,215,1,14,253,35,165,108,66,89,3,61,150,29,12,7,131,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
