Melvyn Grant, a long-time contributor to the band's artwork, created the cover art. \n\nThe album received largely favourable reviews from critics and peaked at No. 1 in 28 countries. This included the United Kingdom, where it became the band's fourth release to top the UK Albums Chart following 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and 1992's Fear of the Dark. On top of this, The Final Frontier also charted at No. 4 in the United States, marking their highest placement on the Billboard 200, in addition to gaining the band their first Grammy award in the Best Metal Performance category for the song &quot;El Dorado&quot;, released as a free download on 8 June 2010.\n\nEMI released the album in most of the world, while in the United States and Canada it was released jointly by Universal Music Enterprises and Sony Music Entertainment Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the successor to the Sanctuary Records/Columbia Records joint venture that had previously controlled the Iron Maiden catalogue in North America.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Satellite 15...
