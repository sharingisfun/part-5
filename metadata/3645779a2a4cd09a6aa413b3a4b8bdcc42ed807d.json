Daft Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3645779a2a4cd09a6aa413b3a4b8bdcc42ed807d","amp;dn":"Daft+Punk+Random+Access+Memories+%5BStream%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3645779a2a4cd09a6aa413b3a4b8bdcc42ed807d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,69,119,154,42,76,208,154,106,164,19,179,164,184,189,204,66,237,128,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
