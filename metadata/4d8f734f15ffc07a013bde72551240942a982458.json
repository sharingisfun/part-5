Three years on, she opens this fourth album with IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Love to Kill You: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d love to kill you as you eat / The pleasure would taste so sweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s said that The House may shock fans whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve followed her since her 2003 breakthrough, and such lyrical wickedness might imply sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been through quite the stylistic sea change.\n\nAs if. The House is as box-ticking of design as even the most fair-weather of fans should expect from an artist whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never pushed at any creative envelope. At their worst these arrangements are lazy to the point of absolute stupor, as lively as a well-fed fatso snoozing in front of the QueenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Christmas speech. This should allow MeluaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice to shine through, but she can sound racked by tracheal rigor mortis, a whisper escaping where a little more of the wow factor that first attracted the ears of Dramatico boss Mike Batt would have improved proceedings.\n\nBatt, for the first time on a Melua album, makes no appearance (save for a single co-write) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in his place William Orbit produces, and former Robbie Williams collaborator Guy Chambers contributes to several songs. This new line-up hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t led to a considerable shift of dynamic, many songs contentedly shuffling at a mid-tempo pace. This is meant as no slight: Melua is the kind of artist who responds to demand, rather than one who writes to challenge her audience. As such The House is largely a success ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ those boxes, ticked. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disappointing that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not edged that little further from her comfort zone given the promise of surprises.\n\nHighlights are apparent, though. The Flood, the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lead single, is a polished arrangement that reins in the temptation for bombast and is better for its restraint. Red Balloons, a co-write with Polly Scattergood, is so delicate the listener might want to hold their breath for its duration, for fear that exhaling would shatter its frail form. And when MeluaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals convey real intimacy and vulnerability, such as on the closing title-track, she engages the listener with a rarefied grace.\n\nWhen Melua reveals this sensitive side sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s amongst the best artists in her easy-on-the-ear field, and she could yet surpass several of her own idols. But The House contains enough forgettable filler to suggest sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s some way off delivering a career-defining canon classic.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/03/katie-melua/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/03/katie-melua/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8f734f15ffc07a013bde72551240942a982458","amp;dn":"Katie+Melua...The+House%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8f734f15ffc07a013bde72551240942a982458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,143,115,79,21,255,192,122,1,59,222,114,85,18,64,148,42,152,36,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
