Get the results you need with an intuitive interface, fast background encoding, and customizable presets. Creative Cloud includes the complete Adobe toolset for video editing, graphic design, and audio mixing, and for publishing content across browsers and devices.\n\nNEW Automated Image Processing - Create a customized output of media, including watermarks and timecode overlays, as well as image processing, such as LUTs, when rendering new content.\n\nNEW GPU Rendering - Work faster and take full advantage of your hardware with full GPU acceleration, now included in Adobe Media Encoder.\n\nMatch Source Settings - Create H.264 and MPEG-2 files faster. Automatically sync key properties with the Match Source Settings option to save time and get better exports. Tweak options like resolution and bandwidth while ensuring the integrity of attributes such as frames per second.\n\nwhat is new in version 8.0.1\n\n*Improved DCP color calibration: Improved color calibration from QuVIS for BT709 workflows. This will result in improvements in source color matching, color saturation, and increased detail in darker areas.\n\n*Moved user preferences and presets to new location: Preference and preset files are now located in your user profileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Documents folder, instead of a folder hidden by the operating system. All preferences and presets from Adobe Media Encoder CC 2014 (8.0) will be automatically moved to the new location. Premiere Pro CC 2014 and Prelude CC 2014 will continue to see and make available your encoding presets.\n\n*4K support in H.264: A new 5.2 Level choice for H.264 provides full support for 4K frame sizes and frame rates.\n\n*New YouTube encoding presets: The encoding presets for YouTube have been completely rebuilt and simplified. The changes include\n- A new preset for 4K resolution (3840 x 2160).\n- All 360p presets have been removed.\n- The Frame Rate and TV Standard settings on all YouTube presets now use Match Source, so only a single preset is required for each frame size.\n- The Target and Max bitrate of the new presets are higher to better align to YouTubeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recommended settings for High Quality uploads.\n- 1-pass instead of 2-pass encoding, which reduces encoding times without a significant loss in quality. Note that YouTube automatically reÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½encodes all uploaded videos for optimized streaming, regardless of source codec. YouTube recommends H.264, which offers both high quality bitrates and reduced upload times.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n-Intel Core2 Duo or AMD Phenom II processor with 64-bit support\n-Microsoft Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 (64 bit) or Windows 8 (64 bit)\n-4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)\n-4 GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices)\n-Additional disk space required for preview files and other working files (10 GB recommended)\n-1280 x 800 display\n-7200 RPM or faster hard drive (multiple fast disk drives configured for RAID 0 recommended)\n-Sound card compatible with ASIO protocol or Microsoft Windows Driver Model\n-QuickTime 7.6.6 software required for QuickTime features\n-Optional: Adobe-certifi ed GPU card for GPU-accelerated performance\n \nLanguages : English, Russian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8550347b565dec5b8308857df883bda004a9d01","amp;dn":"Adobe+Media+Encoder+CC+2014.0.1+8.0.1.48+RePack+by+D%21akov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8550347b565dec5b8308857df883bda004a9d01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,85,3,71,181,101,222,197,184,48,136,87,223,136,59,218,0,74,157,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
