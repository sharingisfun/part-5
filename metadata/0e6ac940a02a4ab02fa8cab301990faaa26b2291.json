It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.[/b]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nm6EriX.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e6ac940a02a4ab02fa8cab301990faaa26b2291","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.2005.S08E08.HDTV.x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e6ac940a02a4ab02fa8cab301990faaa26b2291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,106,201,64,160,42,74,176,47,168,202,179,1,153,15,170,162,107,34,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
