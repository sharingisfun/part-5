By the time Britpop became an actual going concern, Suede were simply grandfathered in; and when the whole thing spittered to its post-Oasis peak, Suede were considered washed up. But in 1993, they were the creators of the fastest-selling debut LP in UK history and had been anointed as saviors of British indie before their debut single, &quot;The Drowners&quot;, even hit the shops. This made them a natural for the British press to create ideas around, and so when Select argued for a return to wit, artifice, glamor, and British art school traditions, Suede were easy avatars for those hopes.\nWit, artifice, and glamor may have been foreign to bands like Oasis or Cast or Ocean Colour Scene, but for many in 1993 they were welcome respites from a hangover of faceless, egoless electronic producers and gruff, dour American arena rock. On the relative margins of UK music, Tricky and PJ Harvey and the Tindersticks lurked-- and the Aueturs and Saint Etienne were also considered prototypical British hopes-- but Suede could articulate the desires of the outsider while broadcasting over Radio 1. Like Pulp, although perhaps neither band would be into the comparison, Suede were a more acceptable and easy to grasp Big New Thing. And, also like Pulp, they were comfortable creating complex pop songs about human relationships-- fluid with notions of sexuality and openly pursuant of lust and animal drives in an demure indie world that favors flowers and letters. Try to imagine, for example, Jarvis Cocker or Brett Anderson wooing someone by making them a mixtape?\nBy Scott Plagenhoef\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Alternative rock, Britpop, glam rock\nQuality: FLAC\nTracklist:\n\nCd 1\n01 - Animal Nitrate.mp3\n02 - Beautiful Ones.mp3\n03 - Trash.mp3\n04 - Filmstar.mp3\n05 - Metal Mickey.mp3\n06 - New Generation.mp3\n07 - So Young.mp3\n08 - The Wild Ones.mp3\n09 - The Drowners.mp3\n10 - Stay Together.mp3\n11 - Lazy.mp3\n12 - Everything Will Flow.mp3\n13 - We Are the Pigs.mp3\n14 - Can't Get Enough.mp3\n15 - Electricity.mp3\n16 - Obsessions.mp3\n17 - She's in Fashion.mp3\n18 - Saturday Night.mp3\n\nCD 2\n01 - Pantomime Horse.mp3\n02 - My Insatiable One.mp3\n03 - Killing of a Flashboy.mp3\n04 - This Hollywood Life.mp3\n05 - Europe Is Our Playground.mp3\n06 - My Dark Star.mp3\n07 - Sleeping Pills.mp3\n08 - By the Sea.mp3\n09 - She.mp3\n10 - Heroine.mp3\n11 - The Living Dead.mp3\n12 - To the Birds.mp3\n13 - The BIg Time.mp3\n14 - The 2 of Us.mp3\n15 - The Asphalt World.mp3\n16 - Still Life.mp3\n17 - The Next Life.mp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5929d83305bbdf904710dd6631909b7608028654","amp;dn":"%282010%29+Suede+-+The+Best+Of+%5BFLAC%2B.cue%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5929d83305bbdf904710dd6631909b7608028654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,41,216,51,5,187,223,144,71,16,221,102,49,144,155,118,8,2,134,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
