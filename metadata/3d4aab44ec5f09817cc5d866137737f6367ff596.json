Promotional info/publisher's summary - &quot;Mark Blake draws on his own interviews with band members as well as the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends, road crew, musical contemporaries, former housemates, and university colleagues to produce a riveting history of one of the biggest rock bands of all time. We follow Pink Floyd from the early psychedelic nights at UFO, to the stadium-rock and concept-album zenith of the seventies, to the acrimonious schisms of the late Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s. Along the way there are fascinating new revelations about Syd BarrettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chaotic life at the time of Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s painstaking and Byzantine recording sessions at Abbey Road, and the fractious negotiations to bring about their fragile, tantalizing reunion in Hyde Park.\nMeticulous, exacting, and ambitious as any Pink Floyd album, Comfortably Numb is the definitive account of this most adventurousÃ¢â‚¬â€and most EnglishÃ¢â‚¬â€rock band.&quot;\n\nReview snippet from Pop Matters - &quot;With Comfortably Numb: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd, author Mark Blake peels back the layers of mystery around the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history with a supple, readable biography, replacing much hearsay and apocrypha with details and facts conveyed with the skepticism of a journalist and the passion of a fan.\n\nBlake, a former editor with BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Q Magazine and longtime contributor to Mojo, is especially good at exploring the clash and union of the personalities that formed Ã¢â‚¬Å“the FloydÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in all its permutations. He focuses on the two primary forces pivotal to its early and later creative fortunes: bass player and songwriter Roger Waters, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mercurial philosopher, the legendarily difficult architect of the FloydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ascension as a pop-cultural force; and Roger (Syd) Barrett, artist, singer and songwriter, the visionary Icarus whose psychological breakdown changed the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view of itself, its music and the way the world viewed Pink Floyd.&quot; - Michael E.
