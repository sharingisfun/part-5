Hobbes's central argumentÃ¢â‚¬â€that human beings are first and foremost concerned with their own fears and desires, and that they must relinquish basic freedoms in order to maintain a peaceful societyÃ¢â‚¬â€has found new adherents and critics in every generation. This new edition, which uses modern text and relies on large-sheet copies from the 1651 Head version, includes interpretive essays by four leading Hobbes scholars: John Dunn, David Dyzenhaus, Elisabeth Ellis, and Bryan Garsten. Taken together with Ian ShapiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wide-ranging introduction, they provide fresh and varied interpretations of Leviathan for our time.\nGenre: Nonfiction, general","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bfc543de8bcbb8653c0a69f1439c36dbb284fd3","amp;dn":"Leviathan_+Or+The+Matter%2C+Forme+-+Thomas+Hobbes.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bfc543de8bcbb8653c0a69f1439c36dbb284fd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,252,84,61,232,188,187,134,83,192,166,159,20,57,195,109,187,40,79,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
