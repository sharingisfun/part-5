Once they adopted their chosen group name, they dropped their own surnames and became Scott, Gary and John Walker. Unable to make it in their American homeland, they relocated to England, where they became successful all over Europe, although they had far more hits in the UK than anywhere else. They sang pop ballads superbly, though they could pick up the tempo enough to provide variation. \n\nTheir biggest hits were Make it easy on yourself (a Bacharach-David song) and The sun ain't gonna shine anymore (a Four seasons song, never released as a single by them). Both those songs were number one hits in the UK, also reaching the top twenty in America. My ship is coming in, a number three UK hit provided their only other (minor) American hit. \n\nOf their other UK hits, the biggest were No regrets (7), Another tear falls (12), You don't have to tell me (13) and a Scott solo, Lights of \nCincinatti (13),\n\n\nTrack Listings \n\n  \n[01] No Regrets \t\t\t\t- The Walker Brothers \t[05:39]\n[02] Make it Easy on Yourself \t\t- The Walker Brothers \t[03:11]\n[03] The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore \t- The Walker Brothers \t[03:00]\n[04] My Ship is Coming In   \t\t- The Walker Brothers \t[02:54]\n[05] Joanna \t\t\t\t- Scott Walker \t\t[03:49]\n[06] Lights of Cincinatti \t\t\t- Scott Walker \t\t[03:19]\n[07] Another Tear Falls \t\t\t- The Walker Brothers \t[02:24]\n[08] Boy Child \t\t\t\t- Scott Walker \t\t[03:34]\n[09] Montague Terrace in Blue \t\t- Scott Walker \t\t[03:26]\n[10] Jackie \t\t\t\t- Scott Walker \t\t[03:20]\n[11] Stay With Me Baby \t\t\t- The Walker Brothers \t[03:16]\n[12] If You Go Away \t\t\t- Scott Walker \t\t[03:56]\n[13] First Love Never Dies  \t\t- The Walker Brothers\t[04:35]\n[14] Love Her \t\t\t\t- The Walker Brothers\t[03:21]\n[15] Walking in the Rain \t\t\t- The Walker Brothers\t[03:25]\n[16] (Baby) You Dont Have to Tell Me \t- The Walker Brothers \t[02:38]\n[17] Deadlier than the Male \t\t- The Walker Brothers \t[02:28]\n[18] We're All Alone \t\t\t- The Walker Brothers \t[04:31]\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:03m:13s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 150mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v7.1.1.5 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 1192\n\nRecords Company    \t- Polygram\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.scottwalker.org.uk \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\nAny Errors In Torrents Or Music Files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Leave A Comment On My Most Recent Torrent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ad670e307adeac9a40dc8435cd005c1873fd675","amp;dn":"%5B1992%5D+The+Best+Of+1965-1976+-+Scott+Walker+%26+The+Walker+Brother","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ad670e307adeac9a40dc8435cd005c1873fd675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,214,112,227,7,173,234,201,164,13,200,67,92,208,5,193,135,63,214,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
