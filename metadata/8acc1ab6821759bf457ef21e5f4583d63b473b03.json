Maybe that was the reason it worked, \n\nthe others being too fast and stopped at the first \n\nsign of lack of continuity or glitch.\n\n\n\n\nI am sharing it in case you also need it when you \n\nchange from the pesky mkvs to the more common \n\nXVID avis I prefer.\n\n\n\nI can seed only for a short time, please seed to keep \n\nit alive.
