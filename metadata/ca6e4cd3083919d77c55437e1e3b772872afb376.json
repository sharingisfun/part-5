Ginsberg is best \n\nknown for the poem Howl (1956), \n\ncelebrating his friends of the Beat \n\nGeneration and attacking what he saw as \n\nthe destructive forces of materialism and \n\nconformity in the United States at the \n\ntime.\n\nGinsberg&amp;#039;s principal work, &quot;Howl&quot;, is \n\nwell-known for its opening line: &quot;I saw \n\nthe best minds of my generation destroyed \n\nby madness, starving hysterical naked....&quot; \n\n&quot;Howl&quot; was considered scandalous at the \n\ntime of its publication, because of the \n\nrawness of its language, which is \n\nfrequently explicit. Shortly after its \n\n1956 publication by San Francisco&amp;#039;s City \n\nLights Bookstore, it was banned for \n\nobscenity. The ban became a cause cÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨bre \n\namong defenders of the First Amendment, \n\nand was later lifted after Judge Clayton \n\nW. Horn declared the poem to possess \n\nredeeming social importance.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsber&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsber&lt;/a&gt;\n\ng\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allenginsberg.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allenginsberg.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRipped by Big Brother\nAll CDs ripped at 192k unless noted\nFirst posted on www.thepiratebay.se\n\nTeam 1984 \nYour best source for:\n    Rare/Out of Print music\n    Audio/Video Bootlegs\n    Old/Out of Print Software\n    Counter-culture books/text\n    Off the beaten path movies\n    Weird Porn\n    Anything else that we dig..\n\nTeam 1984 doesn&amp;#039;t do mainstream\n          doesn&amp;#039;t follow the herd\n          are just some stoned hippies\n                     with attitude\n\nWant to be a member of Team 1984?\nSimple, \n    Just include this NFO\n             and\n    Don&amp;#039;t up anything lame/mainstream\n\nHails to:\n   freakyflicks, Fat Fuck Frank, sickboy88\n   splattergod, ChrisGoes, Bob Dylan\n\nFuck Off to:\n    RIAA, MPAA, Viacom, Metallica\n              ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6e4cd3083919d77c55437e1e3b772872afb376","amp;dn":"Allen+Ginsberg%5C%27s+%5C%22Howl%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6e4cd3083919d77c55437e1e3b772872afb376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,110,76,211,8,57,25,215,124,85,67,126,30,59,119,40,114,175,179,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
