Powerful, noisy and smoky on engine start-up, the DC-6B was flown all over the world and opened up air travel on every continent. Originally designed in 1944 as the XC-112 military transport aircraft, the DC-6B was reworked into a civilian aircraft in order to compete with LockheedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Constellation. The aircraft was a true success story, with some of the 700 aircraft that were built still in service today, predominantly in cargo roles.\n\nThe DC-6B was also used heavily by the United States Air Force and Navy, known as the C-118B or VC-118 in military service, even serving as Air Force One.\n\nDeveloped by the classic airliner experts at Aeroplane Heaven, DC-6B Legends of Flight was built exclusively for Flight Simulator X. Fully functional virtual cockpits, detailed passenger cabins and numerous exterior animations make this a true legend of flight!\n\n    Highly detailed exterior model featuring boarding stairs, service vehicles and other advanced animations\n    High-quality interactive 3D virtual cockpit (VC)\n    Highly detailed authentic liveries\n    High quality sound set\n    Accurate flight dynamics, based on real-world data and tested by real-world pilots\n\n\n\nPlease visit my thread in the Suprbay forums.
