We will look at the process of setting up the lighting for the day time scene, and then shift our parameters to create a night effects.\n\nBy the end of the training, you should be able to generate a fast lighting solution which you can later tweak to achieve the effect and mood that you or your client wants\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22a098ff9a3e0184c2454c702445c814c5f12d0c","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Rendering+Interiors+in+3DS+Max+and+Maxwell+Rend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22a098ff9a3e0184c2454c702445c814c5f12d0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,160,152,255,154,62,1,132,194,69,76,112,36,69,200,20,197,241,45,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
