The same basic elements are still here: a breathtakingly cocky attitude (he repeatedly insists that heÃƒÂ¢??s on the same level as Jay-Z, Biggie, Nas, and 2Pac); versatile production by Just Blaze, Will.I.Am, Kanye West, Scott Storch, and others that should play well in the car, clubs, and earbuds; and an unabashed celebration of regionalism that may please those on the West Coast (though who knows how it will play elsewhere). The problem however is that DoctorÃƒÂ¢??s Advocate feels more like &quot;The Documentary: Part 2&quot; than a new effort. Though The GameÃƒÂ¢??s flow is sharper and more sophisticated, he still spends far too much time celebrating his greatness vis-a-vis other people, playing out this style to the point of gimmickry. ThatÃƒÂ¢??s not to say there arenÃƒÂ¢??t great moments. &quot;Compton&quot; is a rugged celebration of LAÃƒÂ¢??s most notorious ÃƒÂ¢??hood, thereÃƒÂ¢??s some clever double entendre with &quot;ItÃƒÂ¢??s Okay (One Blood),&quot; and &quot;Scream On ÃƒÂ¢??Em&quot; is as chaotic and aggressive as the name suggests. ItÃƒÂ¢??s just that you wish The Game (at the tender age of 26) would learn to navel gaze less about his legacy and spend more time proving why heÃƒÂ¢??s earned such a lofty self-perception. --Oliver Wang\n\n\n\n1. lookin at you\n2. da s***\n3. it&amp;#039;s okay (one blood)\n4. compton\n5. remedy\n6. let&amp;#039;s ride\n7. too much\n8. wouldn&amp;#039;t get far\n9. scream on em\n10. one night\n11. doctor&amp;#039;s advocate\n12. ol&amp;#039; english\n13. california vacation\n14. bang\n15. around the world\n16. why you hate the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eeb876c097bccafd9d6a4c5e6c59e806a72177b","amp;dn":"The+Game+-+Doctor%5C%27s+Advocate+%5BRoman_Gie%5D+192kbit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eeb876c097bccafd9d6a4c5e6c59e806a72177b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,235,135,108,9,123,204,175,217,214,164,197,230,197,158,128,106,114,23,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
