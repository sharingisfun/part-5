With her memory gone, her only hope of survival is to trust the instructions left in her pocket by her former self. She quickly learns that she is a Rook, a high-level operative in a secret agency that protects the world from supernatural threats. But there is a mole inside the organization - and this person wants her dead.\nAs Myfanwy battles to save herself, she encounters a person with four bodies, a woman who can enter her dreams, children transformed into deadly fighters, and an unimaginably vast conspiracy.\n\nSuspenseful and hilarious, &quot;The Rook&quot; is an outrageously inventive debut for listeners who like their espionage with a dollop of purple slime.\n\n\n\nRead by Susan Duerden\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\nLength: 17 hrs and 51 mins\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:03-01-12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d1468456ec11dd7aab595964cb9ab234ed35f73","amp;dn":"Daniel+O%27Malley+-+The+Rook+%28The+Checquy+Files+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d1468456ec11dd7aab595964cb9ab234ed35f73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,20,104,69,110,193,29,215,170,181,149,150,76,185,171,35,78,211,95,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
