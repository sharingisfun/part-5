What is x264? \n\n\nx264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!\n\n02. What is a .mkv file? \n\n\nMKV means \\&quot;matroska video\\&quot; and it is a \\&quot;extensible open standard Audio/Video container\\&quot; (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several videostreams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a42c621f166a3e20894c8d1b5e07b7aed34474b","amp;dn":"Fringe+Season+2+-+HDTV+-+x264+-+MKV+by+RiddlerA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a42c621f166a3e20894c8d1b5e07b7aed34474b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,66,198,33,241,102,163,226,8,148,200,209,181,224,123,122,237,52,71,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
