Written by the great fourteenth-century Arab scholar Ibn KhaldÃƒÂ»n (d. 1406), this monumental work laid down the foundations of several fields of knowledge, including philosophy of history, sociology, ethnography, and economics. The first complete English translation, by the eminent Islamicist and interpreter of Arabic literature Franz Rosenthal, was published in three volumes in 1958 as part of the Bollingen Series and received immediate acclaim in America and abroad. A one-volume abridged version of RosenthalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterful translation was first published in 1969.\n\nThis new edition of the abridged version, with the addition of a key section of RosenthalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own introduction to the three-volume edition, and with a new introduction by Bruce B. Lawrence, will reintroduce this seminal work to twenty-first-century students and scholars of Islam and of medieval and ancient history.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d6878058f1a909366376cd5feaadf395916244","amp;dn":"The+Muqaddimah+%26ndash%3B+Ibn+Khaldun++++++%5BFormatted+and+Bookmarke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d6878058f1a909366376cd5feaadf395916244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,214,135,128,88,241,169,9,54,99,118,205,95,234,173,243,149,145,98,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
