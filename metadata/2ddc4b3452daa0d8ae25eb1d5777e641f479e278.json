The album is a collection of unused tracks from various sessions during Led Zeppelin's twelve-year career. It was released two years after the group had officially disbanded following the death of drummer John Bonham. The word coda, meaning a passage that ends a musical piece following the main body, was therefore chosen as the title.\n\nOverview\n\nJimmy Page explained that part of the reasoning for the album's release related to the popularity of unofficial Led Zeppelin recordings which continued to be circulated by fans:\n\n    &quot;Coda was released, basically, because there was so much bootleg stuff out. We thought, &quot;Well, if there's that much interest, then we may as well put the rest of our studio stuff out&quot;.\n\nJohn Paul Jones recalled:\n\n    &quot;They were good tracks. A lot of it was recorded around the time punk was really happening... basically there wasn't a lot of Zeppelin tracks that didn't go out. We used everything.[2]\n\nAccording to the Led Zeppelin biography Hammer of the Gods, the band also owed Atlantic Records one more album from the five-album deal that created Swan Song Records in 1974. As such, Coda can be seen as a contractual fulfilment.\n\n&quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot; opens the album and, according to the album notes, was recorded at Morgan Studios in June 1969. It was later acknowledged to have come from a January 1970 concert at the Royal Albert Hall, with the guitar parts overdubbed and the original guitar part removedÃ¢â‚¬â€this can be heard in the original Royal Albert Hall show on 9 January 1970. This song was used to open a number of concerts on their 1969 tours and was originally intended to be recorded for inclusion in Led Zeppelin II.\n\n&quot;Poor Tom&quot; is from sessions for Led Zeppelin III, having been recorded at Olympic Studios in June 1970.\n\n&quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot; is taken from the same concert as &quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot; but was listed as a rehearsal in the original liner notes. The recording was edited to remove the overall &quot;live&quot; feel: the crowd noise as well as the beginning and ending of the song were deleted. Crowd tracks were muted on the multitrack mixdown on this recording as with &quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot;.\n\n\n\nThe album cover was designed by Hipgnosis, the fifth album cover the design group designed for Led Zeppelin. It was also the last album cover the group ever designed before disbanding in 1983. The main four letters CODA are from an alphabet, typeface design called &quot;Neon&quot; designed by Bernard Allum in 1978.\n\n2015 reissue\n\nA remastered version of Coda, along with Presence and In Through the Out Door will be reissued on 31 July 2015.\nTrack listing\n\nCoda\t\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n\n1. \t&quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot; (live on 9 January 1970 in London, The United Kingdom) (edit, remix with guitar overdubs, live audience eliminated) \tJames A.
