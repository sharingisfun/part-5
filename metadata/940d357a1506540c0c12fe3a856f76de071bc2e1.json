Here, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost behavioral scientists tackles this age-old question. He shows that there are many ways of achieving happiness; for example, there is the inherent happiness that comes with the love of a child; the competitive happiness of triumphing over your opponents; the sensual happiness of the hedonist. Rather than preaching a particular behavior or way of life, Morris provides knowledge that we can use, if we wish, to make ourselves happier.\n\nISBN 1904435289 \nISBN13: 9781904435280","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940d357a1506540c0c12fe3a856f76de071bc2e1","amp;dn":"Desmond+Morris+-+2004+-+The+Nature+of+Happiness+%28176%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940d357a1506540c0c12fe3a856f76de071bc2e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,13,53,122,21,6,84,12,12,18,254,58,133,111,118,222,7,27,194,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
