Let&amp;#039;s face it, virtual guitars sounded shit!\nUntil now...\nUsing multisamples is one thing, but for the ultimate realism you need to be able to imitate the PLAYING of the real thing. This involves much more than adding pitch bend info, fret noise and velocity switching.\nMusiclab&amp;#039;s RealStrat is based on a large set of Fender Stratocaster samples, but the real magic comes from the way it uses them. A competent player of this VSTi can get all manner of realistic sounds from it, by utilising his/her left hand to alter the style of playing from one note to the next.\nThis allows the most accurate imitation of the electric guitar so far.\nJust check these videos for example:\n\nNow I can&amp;#039;t promise you&amp;#039;ll be playing like that any time soon, but even a beginner can tease out some realistic riffs and chord progressions with a little time and practice. The vast array of MIDI patterns included means you can get straight into creating usable backing tracks, while people with a working knowledge of guitar playing will soon to get to grips with playing solos.\n\nIncluded in this torrent is a rip of the CD, PowerISO with which to mount it, a simple crack, and full installation instructions. \n \nRoute this VSTi into an Amp Simulator, and you&amp;#039;ll be rocking out without needing to know a headstock from a humbucker.\n\n--\nArty - &quot;We really want to see those fingers!&quot;\n11th February 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ffdfd82064eefd1a83154edacb0ed1078f1e4b","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+50-MusicLab+RealStrat+Guitar+VSTi+DXi%2BCrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06ffdfd82064eefd1a83154edacb0ed1078f1e4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,255,223,216,32,100,238,253,26,131,21,78,218,203,14,209,7,143,30,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
