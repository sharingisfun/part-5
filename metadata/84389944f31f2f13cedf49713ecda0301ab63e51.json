Named after the musical term for the measurement of time by an instrument, Mount started Metronomy in 1999 as a side project to the other bands he played with, using an old computer that his father gave him to record songs. Metronomy's first full-band lineup also included keyboardist/saxophonist Oscar Cash and keyboardist/bassist Gabriel Stebbing. Prior to Metronomy, Mount and Stebbing played together in bands such as the Upsides, a pop group the pair described as &quot;the original Busted,&quot; and the Customers, with whom they played in university.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84389944f31f2f13cedf49713ecda0301ab63e51","amp;dn":"Metronomy+-+Love+Letters+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84389944f31f2f13cedf49713ecda0301ab63e51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,56,153,68,243,31,47,19,206,223,73,113,62,205,160,48,26,182,62,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
