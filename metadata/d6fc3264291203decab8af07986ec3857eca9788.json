It was released on June 28 of 2013 in Europe, July 1st in the United Kingdom and July 9 in North America through Nuclear Blast.\n\nProduced by Morten Veland, it was mastered and mixed by Endre Kirkesola at Dub Studios in Norway. The cover art is by artist Anne Stokes, and was discovered by Veland by chance via the Internet.Writing and recording\n\nAilyn joined a Norwegian choir in 2012 to get some training and also inspiration for the upcoming release.According to Morten, the writing process took two years. He began writing for the album before the release of their previous one.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \tThe entire band and all the people we are working with are absolutely ecstatic about it! This album takes SIRENIA to the next level and brings many new sides of us to the table. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s typical tried and tested SIRENIA stuff but also approaches that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never heard from us before. I think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never felt so good about an album throughout my entire career. I mean, I love them all, but this one is something special. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the result of two and a half years of blood, sweat and tears. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve literally put my heart and soul into this record, so I am very curious to see what our fans as well as the press will think about it!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nPromotion\n\nOn May 7 of 2013, Sirenia released a studio trailer for their album via Facebook.
