From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity, there was a span of hardly more than twenty-five years. What began as merely an interesting speculative problem in physics grew into the Manhattan Project, and then into the bomb, with frightening rapidity, while scientists known only to their peersÃ¢â‚¬â€Szilard, Teller, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Meitner, Fermi, Lawrence, and von NeumannÃ¢â‚¬â€stepped from their ivory towers into the limelight.\nRichard Rhodes gives the definitive story of manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most awesome discovery and invention. Told in rich human, political, and scientific detail, The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a narrative tour de force and a document with literary power commensurate with its subject.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\nIf the first 270 pages of this book had been published separately, they would have made up a lively, insightful, beautifully written history of theoretical physics and the men and women who plumbed the mysteries of the atom. Along with the following 600 pages, they become a sweeping epic, filled with terror and pity, of the ultimate scientific quest: the development of the ultimate weapon. Rhodes is a peerless explainer of difficult concepts; he is even better at chronicling the personalities who made the discoveries that led to the Bomb. Niels Bohr dominates the first half of the book as J. Robert Oppenheimer does the second; both men were gifted philosophers of science as well as brilliant physicists. The central irony of this book, which won a National Book Critics Circle Award, is that the greatest minds of the century contributed to the greatest destructive force in history. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\nFrom Library Journal\nThis is a massive work dealing with the history of the people and the science that preceded and then made possible the development of the atomic bomb. Heavily biographical, the book provides portraits of the many players from Szilard and Einstein to Oppenheimer. Rhodes includes detailed explanations of the various scientific discoveries beginning in the late 19th century which culminated in the Manhattan Project. The book is heavily documented and includes a 13-page bibliography. This is a definitive work, well written, with a gripping story. It is not an easy book to read, but it is well worth the effort.

Mr. Rhodes has done a beautiful job, and I don't see how anyone can ever top it.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œLuis W. Alvarez, Nobel Laureate for Physics, 1968\n\n&quot;... what I read already impressed me with the author's knowledge of much of the history of the science which led to the development of nuclear energy and nuclear bombs and of the personalities which contributed in the U.S. to the development of these. I was particularly impressed by his realization of the importance of Leo Szilard's contributions which are almost always underestimated but which he fully realizes and perhaps even overestimates. I hope the book will find a wide readership.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œEugene P. Wigner, Nobel Laureate for Physics, 1963\n\n&quot;I found The Making of the Atomic Bomb well written, interesting and one of the best in the great family of books on the subject. It is fascinating as a novel, and I have learned from it many things I did not know. Mr. Rhodes has done his homework conscientiously and intelligently&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œEmilio SegrÃƒÂ¨, Nobel Laureate for Physics, 1959\n\n&quot;Mr. Rhodes gives careful attention to the role which chemists played in developing the bomb. the Making of the Atomic Bomb strikes me as the most complete account of the Manhattan Project to date.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œGlenn T. Seaborg, Nobel Laureate for Chemistry, 1951\n\n&quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb is an epic worthy of Milton. Nowhere else have I seen the whole story put down with such elegance and gusto and in such revealing detail and simple language which carries the reader through wonderful and profound scientific discoveries and their application.\nThe great figures of the age, scientific, military, and political, come to life when confronted with the fateful and awesome decisions which faced them in this agonizing century. This great book dealing with the most profound problems of the 20th century can help us to apprehend the opportunities and pitfalls that face the world int he 21st.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œI. I. Rabi, Nobel Laureate for Physics, 1944\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nRichard Rhodes is the author of numerous books and the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award.
