Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at july, 25 2009 - 14.40 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:227748a375b18eff2c93c5ced8181256872158b5","amp;dn":"NCH+WavePad+Sound+Editor+Master%5C%27s+Edition+4.24+%2B+Keygen+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"227748a375b18eff2c93c5ced8181256872158b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,119,72,163,117,177,142,255,44,147,197,206,216,24,18,86,135,33,88,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
