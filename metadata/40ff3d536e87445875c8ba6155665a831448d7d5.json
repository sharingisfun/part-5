Sharpened as the BD looks little dull. Separate OP,ED encoded with CRF 16 placebo+ preset, with more detail enhancement. \r\nEnglish AC-3 track kept intact and the Japanese track encoded into AAC LC TrueVBR â‰¥ Q91 using Apple AAC Encoder (QAAC/CoreAudioToolbox). \r\nAudio in OP,ED are lossless, FLAC. Separate OP,ED are included just for fun, with higher A/V quality. Each episode has it's own OP,ED... \r\nOrdered Chapters (OC) with Segment Linking was NOT used :) \r\nFor the previous 720p release, subtitles were slightly modified. Fixed some issues with timing and signs I found randomly. Didn't had resource related time to go through each and every line though! :( \r\nAnd for this 1080p release, couple of small changes has been done. \r\nFor ppl who hate LTFinnegan (there are many) AND prefer simple fonts (not many), an extra track added with a different dialogue font :) \r\n \r\nOverall, the source video looks better than this. But in most cases, the difference is marginal or like apples/oranges. You compare/decide. \r\nThe source has Micro level details. In this release some micro details are lost due to the nature of HEVC (con), but this has Macro level sharpness (pro :)  \nhttp://compare.bakashots.me/compare.php?setId=2061  \nhttp://diff.pics/sZ13WTOrl0QT \r\n \r\n- \r\n\r\n \r\n720p  \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Log+Horizon+720p+KoTuWa  \nhttp://torrentz.in/anyA?f=Log+Horizon+720p+KoTuWa \r\n \r\nRelated  \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Log+Horizon+KoTuWa  \nhttp://torrentz.in/anyA?f=Log+Horizon+KoTuWa \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAll in One Place :] \r\r\n\r\n  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/4BmPkK3.png  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/5uqf5k2.png \r\n\r\nRelease Group [AnimeRG] \r \nhttp://google.com/#q=AnimeRG \r\n\r\n\r\nSee also  \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kotuwa  \nhttp://kat.cr/user/kotuwa/uploads \r\n \r\n \r\nGreetings: Aibowan!... à¶¢à¶º à·€à·šà·€à·!... à¶†à¶ºà·”à¶¶à· à·€à·šà·€à·!.. \r\nDon't forget to leave a Comment and give your feedback!.. :]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40ff3d536e87445875c8ba6155665a831448d7d5","amp;dn":"%5BAnimeRG%5D+Log+Horizon+S1+%281080p%29+BluRay+Dual+Audio+HEVC+%5BKoTuWa%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40ff3d536e87445875c8ba6155665a831448d7d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,255,61,83,110,135,68,88,117,200,186,97,85,102,90,131,20,72,215,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
