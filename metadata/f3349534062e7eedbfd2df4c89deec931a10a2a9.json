Their debut LP Whore of Bethlehem was released in September 2006, and they embarked on a European tour in spring 2007 with Black Witchery. A live split of this tour was released as Desecration &amp; Sodomy in 2008.\n\nTheir latest album, titled The Apocalyptic Triumphator was released January 2015.\n\nReview:\nimage\nQuote:\nA mere six years since their latest full length album, FinlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masters of bestial and primal black/death metal return with the their third full length album, the aptly titled The Apocalyptic Triumphator. Archgoat has been one of the most consistent bands in the niche, never faltering or wavering in their devotion to the rebel angel or their commitment to playing ferocious metal. Formed in 1989, Archgoat released a pair of demos before unleashing their debut EP, Angelcunt (Tales of Desecration), in 1993; initially splitting up that same year. Eleven years later, the band reformed and picked up exactly where they left off. Since their reformation the band released two devastating full length albums, Whore of Bethlehem (2006) and The Light-Devouring Darkness (2009), amid a slew of splits and EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Returning with their first full length is six years, The Apocalyptic Triumphator, Archgoat sets out to destroy all that is holy with a January 2015 release through Debemur Morti Productions.\n\nWith founding members Ritual Butcherer on guitars and Lord Angelslayer on bass and vocals joined once again by long-time drummer Sinisterror, The Apocalyptic Triumphator takes you through twelve tracks of primal, blasting blackness that Archgoat has been peddling since their formation. Archgoat brings two parts to their latest offering, with each side of the album containing a different path, The Right Hand Path or The Left Hand Path, each containing an intro track. Obviously this was designed with the intention of starting each side of the vinyl release, but, still, the album is also getting a CD version. The production is purposely murky, providing another element of savage darkness that suits ArchgoatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style so well. Those familiar with the band should find no surprises within.\n\nTowards the beginning of the album, tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nuns, Cunts and DarknessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Luciferian TheophanyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ show the band surging with a slower attack, full of simplistic yet heavy, crushing riffs and Lord AngelslayerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gravelly, guttural growls from the abyss. At the other end of the spectrum, songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Congregation of CircumcisedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Profanator of the 1st CommandmentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bring savage, fast paced riffing and primal blasting drums. Archgoat has a knack for writing well paced albums, full of a wide range of tempos, and The Apocalyptic Triumphator doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disappoint. Unlike some of their contemporaries, Archgoat is not content to just blast and destroy or writhe in plodding darkness, although they do both of those things exceedingly well. Seamlessly weaving the primordial swagger of proto black metal with the crushing heaviness of the Ross Bay scene and some of the most gravel-laden, demonic bellows ever recorded, Archgoat excel at crafting dark and evil music, plain and simple.\n\nThe Apocalyptic Triumphator fits perfectly next the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous material. Frankly, they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done anything differently than before, but perhaps thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why it works so well. Alongside Beherit, Blasphemy and Black Witchery, Archgoat helped to craft that caustic combination of black and death metal that many often refer to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“war metalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or some similar nonsense. There is no reason that fans of any bands mentioned in this review should not go find this now. Paraphrasing the band; the black crusade continues against the religion of the weak. The Apocalyptic Triumphator shows why Archgoat gets the respect in the scene that they do; primal, savage and black as pitch. By doing what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always done Archgoat has struck blackened gold once again.\n\nMembers:\nimage\nLord Angelslayer Bass, Vocals\nRitual Butcherer Guitars\nSinisterror Drums\n\n\n\nBand Discography:\n\nJesus Spawn - Demo - 1991\nPenis Perversor - Demo - 1993\nAngelcunt (Tales of Desecration) - EP - 1993\nMesse des Morts / Angelcunt - Split - 1999\nAngelslaying Black Fucking Metal - EP - 2005\nWhore of Bethlehem - Full-length - 2006\nDesecration &amp; Sodomy - Split - 2008\nThe Light-Devouring Darkness - Full-length - 2009\nThe Aeon of the Angelslaying Darkness - Compilation - 2010\nHeavenly Vulva (Christ's Last Rites) - EP - 2011\nReh &amp; Live 1990 / Jesus Spawn - Split - 2013\nAngelslaying Christbeheading Black Fucking Metal - Split - 2013 -\nBrazilian Ritual Second Attack - Split video - 2014 -\nThe Apocalyptic Triumphator - Full-length - 2015\n\n\n01.
