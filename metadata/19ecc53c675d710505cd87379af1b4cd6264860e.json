Ian Richardson\\&amp;#039;s Lear-like depiction of the mad earl of a remote, vast, ritual-obsessed building is matched by the brutal pragmatism of Celia Imrie as his wife, the synchronised madness of Zoe Wanamaker and Lynsey Baxter as his twin sisters and the duplicitous charm of Jonathan Rhys-Meyer as Steerpike, the kitchen-boy determined to take over no matter how many deaths it costs. John Sessions is surprisingly touching as Prunesquallor, the family doctor who realises almost too late what Steerpike intends. \n\nFour one hour episodes plus &quot;The Making of Gormenghast&quot; (30 mins)\n\n&lt;pre&gt;\nVideo Codec      : XVID\nVideo Bitrate    : 137 kbps\nVideo Frame Rate : 25 fps\nVideo Frame Size : 704x400\nAudio Codec      : MP3\nAudio Bitrate    : 128 kbps CBR\n&amp;lt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ecc53c675d710505cd87379af1b4cd6264860e","amp;dn":"Gormenghast+DVDRip+%28XVID%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ecc53c675d710505cd87379af1b4cd6264860e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,236,197,60,103,93,113,5,5,205,135,55,154,241,180,205,98,100,134,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
