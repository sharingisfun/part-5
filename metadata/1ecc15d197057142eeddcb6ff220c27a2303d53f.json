Veterinarians, animal scientists, dog owners, trainers, consultants, and counsellors will find this book a benchmark reference and handbook concerning positive, humane management and control of dogs.\n\nReflecting the author's extensive work with dogs, this book promises thorough explanations of topics, and proven behavioural strategies that have been designed, tested, and used by the author. More than 50 figures and tables illustrate this unique and significant contribution to dog behaviour, training, and learning.\n\nVolume one covers origins and domestication, development of behavior, neurobiology of behavior and learning, sensory abilities, biological and dispositional constraints on learning, classical conditioning, instrumental learning, aversive control of behavior; learning and behavioral disturbances, and human-dog companionship.\n\n\n\nHandbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Volume Two, Etiology and Assessment of Behavior Problems\nSteve Lindsay\nISBN: 978-0-8138-2868-8\n328 pages\nOctober 2001, Wiley-Blackwell\n\nHandbook of Applied Dog Behaviour and Training, Volume two: Etiology and Assessment of Behaviour Problems is the definitive reference for dog trainers, behaviourists, breeders and veterinarians. Coupled with Volume one, this text provides theoretical and practical framework for understanding the development and treatment of dog behaviour problems.\n\nTopics covered include Fear, anxiety and phobias, Separation-related problems, Hyperactivity, and Dominance, territorial, and fear-related aggression.\n\nThe focus is to present and evaluate the relevant applied and scientific literature, and to highlight what remains to be learned, while the author introduces alternative ways for analysing and understanding the etiology of dog behaviour problems.\n\n\n\nHandbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Procedures and Protocols: Procedures and Protocols\nBy Steven R Lindsay\nPublished by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008\nISBN 047034413X, 9780470344132\n\nIn Volume 3, various themes introduced in Volumes 1 and 2 are expanded upon, especially causally significant social, biological, and behavioral influences that impact on the etiology of behavior problems and their treatment. Ethological observations, relevant behavioral and neurobiological research, and dog behavior clinical findings are reviewed and critiqued in detail. Many of the training concepts, procedures, and protocols described have not been previously published, making this book a unique contribution to dog behavior and training literature.\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Educators and students alike are constantly searching for the perfect balance of depth and breadth in a text, attempting to find the single source that will simplify their lives. Some texts are research dense but narrowly focused. Others cover a broad spectrum of topics in a given area but do not go into the related research in any depth.
