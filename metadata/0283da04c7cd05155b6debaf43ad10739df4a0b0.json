That's because this story-driven\nsingle-player game is played through the eyes of Cliff Calo, who's\nwatching his world unravel\n\nCliff is the spoiled son of a powerful media mogul who has stolen a yacht\nwith his friends determined to film the documentary of the century:\nexposing the truth about the Banoi outbreak to the public. Their plan:\ninfiltrate the archipelago's top-secret quarantined island of Narapela and\ndocument everything\n\nPlayers freely explore this all-new island, sneaking to avoid undead that\ncan hear and smell you. But even this island full of zombies isn't what it\nappears to be on the surface\n\nCliff struggles with his own sanity as the world around him begins to\nbecome increasingly unpredictable. Time distorts and folds in on itself;\nstrange messages appear and impossible events shatter reality. Oceans turn\nto blood, containers plummet from the clear sky... If Cliff had any\nthoughts about this being a routine documentary, he'd be &quot;dead&quot; wrong\n\nThe whole experience is vividly realized with comic-inspired visuals that\ncomplement Cliff's surreal situation, delivering on Dead Island's promise\nof a paradise gone to hell. In the case of Escape, it turns out to be a\nparticularly private hell\n\nInstallation Information:\n\n* Burn or mount\n* Install\n* Play the game ( make sure use the shortcut on desktop )\n\nNOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall\n\n/TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\nQUALITY, TRADITION AND PRIDE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0283da04c7cd05155b6debaf43ad10739df4a0b0","amp;dn":"Escape.Dead.Island-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0283da04c7cd05155b6debaf43ad10739df4a0b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,131,218,4,199,205,5,21,91,109,235,175,67,173,16,115,157,244,160,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
