But a sexy, determinedly single mom just might be the one to throw him off his game...\n\nFor years Mick has been taking full advantage of the life available to a pro athlete: fame, fortune, and a different girl in every city. But when he meets and beds confident, beautiful event planner Tara Lincoln, he wants much more than the typical one-night stand. Too bad Tara's not interested in getting to know football's most notorious playboy any better.\n\nAs the single mother of a teenage son, the last thing Tara needs is the jet-set lifestyle of Mick Riley; even though their steamy and passionate one-night stand was unforgettable. Tara's life is complicated enough without being thrust into the spotlight as Mick's latest girl du jour. Tara played the game of love once and lost big, and she doesn't intend to put herself out there again, especially with a heartbreaker like Mick.\n\nBut when Mick sets his mind to win, nothing will stop him. And he has the perfect play in mind.\n\nChanging The Game (Play by Play #2) by Jaci Burton (August 2nd 2011)\n\nMost people play by the rules. Gavin and Liz aren't most people....\n\nWin at any cost. That's always been the mantra of sports agent Liz Darnell. When she carries things too far and risks losing her number-one client, baseball pro Gavin Riley, Liz realizes that she'll have to work extra innings to win him back. It might not be too much of a stretch. She's had a thing for this player's moves since she first laid eyes on him, and by the looks of it, he wants her just as bad.\n\nGavin's more than readyÃ¢â‚¬â€especially when Liz is offering herself as part of the bargain. And as much of her as Gavin wants. For added thrills, he decides to throw a little curve ball Liz's way to see just how far she's truly willing to go to keep him as a client. But when love unexpectedly enters the playing field, neither Liz nor Gavin are ready for the biggest game-changer of them all.\n\nTaking a Shot (Play by Play #3) by Jaci Burton (March 6th 2012)\n\nIf you want to score, you have to get in the game... \n\nThe last thing Jenna Riley needs is more sports in her life. While her brothers are off being athletic superstars, she's stuck running the family's sports bar, whether she likes it or not. Then in walks pro hockey stud Tyler Anderson. As much as Jenna would like to go to the boards with him, she's vowed to never fall for a jock-even one as hot as Ty.\n\nTy, intrigued by the beautiful bar owner, becomes a regular. He senses that Jenna wants to do something more with her life. And as he gains her trust, the passion between them grows, as does Ty's insistence that Jenna should start living for herself. With his encouragement, Jenna starts to believe it, too...\n\nBut first, Jenna has to figure out what she wants, what she needs, who she loves, and if she has the passion and pride to take a shot at having it all-including Ty...\n\nPlaying to Win (Play by Play #4) by Jaci Burton (September 4th 2012)\n\nSomeoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to have to let down their guardÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nFootball star Cole Riley is notorious for doing as he pleasesÃ¢â‚¬â€on the field and off. He parties hard and fights harder, but if he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t clean up his act, his career is overÃ¢â‚¬â€so Cole reluctantly agrees to work with image makeover consultant Savannah Brooks. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not used to being told what to do, especially by some (admittedly hot) Southern belle. As for Savannah, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not convinced she can transform this cocky (and aggressively sexy) force of nature. But sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to give it her best shot.\n\nWhen the sparks start to fly, Savannah lays down the ground rules: no personal complications. If she can turn off the tingle she feels every time Cole gives her a hot stare with his gorgeous baby blues, he can turn off his desire as well. But for two people determined to have it all, a hands-off policy can only last so long before one of them yields.\n\nThrown by a Curve (Play by Play #5) by Jaci Burton (March 5th 2013)\n\nSports medicine specialist Alicia Riley has the job of her dreams, until she's assigned to star pitcher Garrett Scott. Undergoing shoulder rehab, it's make it or break it time for Garrett, and he needs to focus to get back on the mound in time for opening day. But close proximity and combustible chemistry is a dangerous combination, and both Alicia and Garrett have a lot to lose if this doesn't work.\n\nOne Sweet Ride (Play by Play #6) by Jaci Burton (June 4th 2013)\n\nRace car driver Gray Preston enjoys fast cars and an uncomplicated life, until political aide Evelyn Hill enters the picture and complicates the hell out of it with a request that he help out his estranged fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political campaign. Racing and politics donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mix, but Gray and EvelynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexual attraction sizzles like asphalt in August.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:938321f144b8654bd98a47eb3e6c6ab8bf2f817e","amp;dn":"Play+by+Play+Series+%281-6%29+by+Jaci+Burton+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"938321f144b8654bd98a47eb3e6c6ab8bf2f817e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,131,33,241,68,184,101,75,217,138,71,235,62,108,106,184,191,47,129,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
