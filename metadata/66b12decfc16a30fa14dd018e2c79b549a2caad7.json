It peaked at #30 in the UK Albums Chart. The album's sales were disappointing and reviews were mixed. The lead single from the album, &quot;Airhead&quot;, peaked at #53. Second and third singles, &quot;Hot Sauce&quot; and &quot;My Brain Is Like a Sieve&quot;, peaked at #80 and #89 respectively. In the U.S., the album peaked at #70.\n\nDolby has said in interviews that he believes the album's commercial failure was due to his change in musical direction, evident on the album. Expectations of songs in the mould of &quot;She Blinded Me With Science&quot; and &quot;Hyperactive!&quot; were met only by the album's second track, &quot;Airhead&quot;.
