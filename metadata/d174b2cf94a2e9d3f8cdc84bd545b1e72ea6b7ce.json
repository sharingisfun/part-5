Russell...writes with the kind of verve, freshness and personal engagement that lesser spirits would never have permitted themselves. This boldness, together with the astonishing breadth of his general historical knowledge, allows him to put philosophers into their social and cultural context... The result is exactly the kind of philosophy that most people would like to read, but which only Russell could possibly have written.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œRay Monk\n\n&quot;A survey of Western philosophy in relation to its environment, of such sweep and acuteness, alive in every nerve . . . a masterpiece of intellectual energy . . . the Socrates of our time.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œA. L. Rowse\n\n&quot;A great philosopher's lucid and magisterial look at the history of his own subject, wonderfully readable and enlightening.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ*The Observer*\n\n&quot;Bertrand Russell's remarkable book, is so far as I am aware, the first attempt to present a history of Western philosophy in relation to its social and economic background. As such, and also as a brilliantly written expose of changing philosophical doctrines, it should be widely read.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œSir Julian Huxley\n\n&quot;It is certain of a very wide audience, and is, in my opinion, just the kind of thing people ought to have to make them understand the past . . . It may be one of the most valuable books of our time.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œG. M. Trevelyan\n\nProduct Description\n\nNearly forty years since its first publication, A History of Western Philosophy remains unchallenged as the ultimate introduction to its subject, while claiming classic status in its own right. It is the bestselling philosophy book of the twentieth century and one of the most important philosophical works of all time. This compact and affordable paperback edition makes this comprehensive and brilliantly written text readily available for a new generation of readers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d174b2cf94a2e9d3f8cdc84bd545b1e72ea6b7ce","amp;dn":"Bertrand+Russell+-+History+of+Western+Philosophy+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d174b2cf94a2e9d3f8cdc84bd545b1e72ea6b7ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,116,178,207,148,162,233,211,248,205,200,75,213,69,177,231,46,166,183,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
