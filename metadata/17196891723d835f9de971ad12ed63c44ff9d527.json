Dire Straits' sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, and blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more &quot;rootsy&quot; influence that emerged from pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic. Dire Straits' biggest selling album, Brothers in Arms, has sold over 30 million copies, and was the first album to sell a million copies on CD.\n\nThey also became one of the world's most commercially successful bands, with worldwide album sales of over 120 million. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit AwardsÃ¢â‚¬â€winning Best British Group twice, two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other music awards. The band's songs include &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, &quot;Private Investigations&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, and &quot;Telegraph Road&quot;.\n\nAccording to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK albums chart, ranking fifth all-time. Their career spanned a combined total of 15 years. They originally split up in 1988, but reformed in 1991, and disbanded for good in 1995 when Mark Knopfler launched his career full-time as a solo artist. There were several changes in personnel over both periods, leaving Mark Knopfler and John Illsley as the only two original bandmates who had remained throughout the band's career.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits is the second greatest hits compilation by the British rock band Dire Straits, released on 10 November 1998 by Mercury Records internationally, and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The album was originally released, featuring liner notes by Robert Sandall, as both a one-disc edition and two-disc edition. The second disc contains live performances. The release is named after the band's 1978 hit single of the same name. The compilation was re-released together with a DVD in 2002. The DVD features the music videos of all the songs on the first disc, in addition to short interviews with Mark Knopfler about each song.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMembers:\n\n\nMark Knopfler: lead vocals, guitar (1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)\n\nJohn Illsley: bass guitar, backing vocals (1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)\n\nAlan Clark: keyboards (1980Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)\n\nGuy Fletcher: synthesizer, backing vocals (1984Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)\n\nDavid Knopfler: rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1980)\n\nPick Withers: drums, percussion (1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1982)\n\nTerry Williams: drums (1982Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1989)\n\nJack Sonni: rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1985Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1988)\n\nHal Lindes: rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1980Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1985)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17196891723d835f9de971ad12ed63c44ff9d527","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits%2FSultans+Of+Swing-The+Very+Best+Of+%5B1998%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17196891723d835f9de971ad12ed63c44ff9d527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,25,104,145,114,61,131,95,157,233,113,173,18,237,99,196,79,249,213,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
