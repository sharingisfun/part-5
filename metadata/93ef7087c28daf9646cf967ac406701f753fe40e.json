It     reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and makes a great server accelerator. It runs on most available operating systems, including Windows and is licensed under the GNU GPL.\n\n&quot;I think many people already know what Squid is :-) So I won't go into details here.&quot;\n\nThis is a windows version of the popular linux based proxy-caching server.You can get all other versions on squid site. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.squid-cache.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.squid-cache.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease see the below link.. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mmitpros.ning.com/group/smenetworking/forum/topics/3-in-1-proxy-installer-for&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mmitpros.ning.com/group/smenetworking/forum/topics/3-in-1-proxy-installer-for&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nQuotes\n\n&quot;Just to let you know I have created a installer for Squid, SquidGuard and SARG for using on Windows platform. It was initially done for company internal use for deloyment to other offices. But since is a compilation of several OpenSource tools I thought I might as well share for everyone else.&quot;\n\n\nInstall Notes: \n\n* Just run the .exe .This will install Squid/Squidguard and SARG in C:\\ directory. \n* Search this file c:\\squid\\etc\\squid.conf and modify it as you need and restart squid.\n\n... and you are done.\n\nThe installer creates desktop Folder called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œProxy 3 in 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which contains short cuts to basic manuals, maintenance and monitoring utilities for Proxy server.Use the manual to modify squid.conf.\n\n\nThis installer was made by:Kyi Thar.\nSquid-cache.org is a open source project. But you can always donate if you like.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93ef7087c28daf9646cf967ac406701f753fe40e","amp;dn":"Proxy+3+in+1+installer+for+Windows+%5Bsquid-proxy-server%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93ef7087c28daf9646cf967ac406701f753fe40e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,239,112,135,194,141,175,150,70,207,150,122,196,6,112,31,117,63,228,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
