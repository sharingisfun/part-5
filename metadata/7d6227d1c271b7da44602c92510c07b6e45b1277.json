The life of Booker T. Washington was the embodiment of the \nAmerican self-made man, and his autobiography gave voice for the first \ntime to a vast group that had to pull itself up from nothing. The \nwell-documented ordeals and observations of this humble and plainspoken \nschoolmaster reveal traces of Washington's other nature: the ambitious \nand tough-minded analyst. Here was a man who had to balance the demands \nof his fellow blacks with the constraints imposed on him by whites. \n\nHistorically acknowledged as one of America's most powerful and \npersuasive orators, Booker T. Washington consistently challenged the \nforces of racial prejudice at a time when such behavior from a black man \nwas unheard of. While he mollified white leaders by publicly agreeing \nwith their racist views of social parity, he also worked tirelessly to \nconvince blacks to work together as one people in order to improve their \nlives and the future of their race. \n\nThis story of Booker T. Washington's rise to distinction emphasizes that \na strong work ethic and excellence in whatever one is doing will be \nrewarded no matter what race or what position a person holds in life. As \nfar as Washington was concerned, slavery only made the black person \nstronger. He also argued that both blacks and whites would benefit more \nfrom giving blacks vocational training than from encouraging the &quot;craze \nfor Greek and Latin learning.&quot; While this set him at odds with other \nblack leaders of his time, it also set the groundwork for Washington's \nTuskegee Institute to be the best-funded black educational institution \nof its era. \n - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nUp from Slavery is the 1901 autobiography of Booker T. Washington \ndetailing his slow and steady rise from a slave child during the Civil \nWar, to the difficulties and obstacles he overcame to get an education \nat the new Hampton University, to his work establishing vocational \nschoolsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½most notably the Tuskegee Institute in AlabamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to help black \npeople and other disadvantaged minorities learn useful, marketable \nskills and work to pull themselves, as a race, up by the bootstraps. He \nreflects on the generosity of both teachers and philanthropists who \nhelped in educating blacks and native Americans. He describes his \nefforts to instill manners, breeding, health and a feeling of dignity to \nstudents. His educational philosophy stresses combining academic \nsubjects with learning a trade (something which is reminiscent of the \neducational theories of John Ruskin). Washington explained that the \nintegration of practical subjects is partly designed to reassure the \nwhite community as to the usefulness of educating black people.\n\nWashington was a somewhat controversial figure in his own lifetime, and \nW. E. B. Du Bois, for example, criticized some of his views. The book \nwas, however, a best-seller. While it is aimed at the general reader, \nV.S. Naipaul has commented that it appears to be sending out separate \nmessages to black and white readers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6227d1c271b7da44602c92510c07b6e45b1277","amp;dn":"UP+FROM+SLAVERY+-+Booker+T.+Washington.+Richard+Allen+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6227d1c271b7da44602c92510c07b6e45b1277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,98,39,209,194,113,183,218,68,96,44,146,81,12,7,182,228,91,18,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
