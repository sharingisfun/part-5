Woods, trans.) - Joseph and His Brothers (Everyman's Library, 2005). 1492 pages.\n\nNew scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate metadata and pagination, etc.\n\n\nThis will surely be the last Thomas Mann book I scan!\n\n\ndescription:\n\nThis remarkable new translation of the Nobel Prize-winner's great masterpiece is a major literary event.\n\nThomas Mann regarded his monumental retelling of the biblical story of Joseph as his magnum opus. He conceived of the four parts - The Stories of Jacob, Young Joseph, Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph the Provider - as a unified narrative, a &quot;mythological novel&quot; of Joseph's fall into slavery and his rise to be lord over Egypt. Deploying lavish, persuasive detail, Mann conjures for us the world of patriarchs and pharaohs, the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Palestine, and the universal force of human love in all its beauty, desperation, absurdity, and pain. The result is a brilliant amalgam of humor, emotion, psychological insight, and epic grandeur.\n\nNow the award-winning translator John E. Woods gives us a definitive new English version of Joseph and His Brothers that is worthy of MannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s achievement, revealing the novel's exuberant polyphony of ancient and modern voices, a rich music that is by turns elegant, coarse, and sublime.\n\n----\n\nfor more Thomas Mann, see workerbee's torrent here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10470319&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10470319&lt;/a&gt;\nThis torrent also has links to other Mann torrents, including my own previous scans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9fef08a786d35a3645e123f04ed58c8005176d","amp;dn":"Thomas+Mann+-+Joseph+and+His+Brothers+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9fef08a786d35a3645e123f04ed58c8005176d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,159,239,8,167,134,211,90,54,69,225,35,240,78,213,140,128,5,23,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
