With hindsight, these have come to be recognized as peak achievements of both the British folk-rock scene and the entire rock singer/songwriter genre. Sometimes compared to Van Morrison, Drake in fact resembled Donovan much more in his breathy vocals, strong melodies, and the acoustic-based orchestral sweep of his arrangements. His was a much darker vision than Donovan's, however, with disturbing themes of melancholy, failed romance, mortality, and depression lurking just beneath, or even well above, the surface. Ironically, Drake has achieved a far greater stature in the decades following his death, with an avid cult following that grows by the year.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f34ed6c400c0455eb7e6b55f68467aeecd8a0f","amp;dn":"Nick+Drake+-+A+Day+Gone+By...+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f34ed6c400c0455eb7e6b55f68467aeecd8a0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,243,78,214,196,0,192,69,94,183,230,181,95,104,70,122,238,205,138,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
