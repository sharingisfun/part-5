Nora, at first, recounts nothing that Effie really wants to hear--like who her real father was. Effie tells various versions of her life at college, where in fact she lives in a lethargic relationship with Bob, a student who never goes to lectures, seldom gets out of bed, and to whom Klingons are as real as Spaniards and Germans.\n\nBut as mother and daughter spin their tales, strange things are happening around them. Is Effie being followed? Is someone killing the old people? And where is the mysterious yellow dog?\n\nIn a brilliant comic narrative which explores the nonsensical power of language and meaning, Kate Atkinson has created another magical masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae67d45c99771defbf1781a75ff96b4f6fd8e2e1","amp;dn":"Emotionally+Weird+-+Kate+Atkinson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae67d45c99771defbf1781a75ff96b4f6fd8e2e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,103,212,92,153,119,29,239,191,23,129,167,95,249,107,79,111,216,226,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
