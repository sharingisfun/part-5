Spector produced many of their wall-of-sound draped, blue-eyed soul hits, giving the Southern California singing twosome a singularly dramatic and defining pop sound. As could be expected, Spector's totalitarian studio manner became too much, and the duo left Phillies for a seven-year stay at Verve; the hits did not flow as expected, but there were enough highlights to keep the group in the spotlight. Fortunately, this slim hits package combines some of the more memorable late-'60s and early-'70s Verve moments with several earlier Spector-produced classics like &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin',&quot; &quot;Unchained Melody,&quot; &quot;White Cliffs of Dover,&quot; &quot;Ebb Tide,&quot; and &quot;Just Once in My Life.&quot; Continuity is maintained between the Spector tracks and later hits such as &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; and &quot;See That Girl&quot; thanks to Righteous Brother Bill Medley's Spector-like production work while at Verve. And through all the bombast, there is a fine cover of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; and &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; to remind listeners of the group's impressive soul chops and doo wop beginnings. Maybe not as prime a hits package as Rhino's Anthology, but a bargain for those in need of a brief, but respectable roundup.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c712b12f197108c1954a89eb8a1ddf13f74ac0af","amp;dn":"The+Righteous+Brothers+-+Greatest+Hits+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c712b12f197108c1954a89eb8a1ddf13f74ac0af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,18,177,47,25,113,8,193,149,74,137,235,138,29,223,19,247,74,192,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
