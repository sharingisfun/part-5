He is famed for his spare and rigorous compositions and use of materials, notably concrete. In Ando's architecture the experience of space and nature - sunlight, sky and wind - is one of the main themes. Among his best-known buildings are the Wall House, the Rokko Housing Development, the Mount Rokko Chapel and the Museum of Literature in Himeji. This work covers all his important projects and buildings, including his most recent, such as the Japan Pavilion in Seville and the Vitra Seminar House in Weil/Basel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:555f37418a0fcd275fea1dff789b60d6d870aa4d","amp;dn":"Tadao+Ando+%28Studio+Paperbacks%29+By+Masao+Furuyama+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"555f37418a0fcd275fea1dff789b60d6d870aa4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,95,55,65,138,15,205,39,95,234,29,255,120,155,96,214,216,112,170,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
