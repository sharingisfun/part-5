The Future Weather EP is the follow-up to the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2008 debut album, Wagonwheel Blues, and their ex-guitarist Kurt VileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s star has certainly risen since that albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s release, but The War on DrugsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ blend of laid-back indie-pop and Americana is back for another shot at the brass ring regardless.\n\nThe mini-album is full of spaced-out wonder. Take, for example, the knee-slapping Americana of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaby Missiles,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a track reminiscent of WagonwheelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s highlight track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTaking The Farm.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Layered guitars, harmonica, and lead singer/songwriter Adam GranducielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s entrancing vocals all sound fuzz-pedaled out. Then thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the steady acoustic strum and electric guitar solos of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCominÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Through,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the surreal folk vibe of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPile Of Tires,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the slow-burning, 8-minute long album closer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe History Of Plastic,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a lament about being used and discarded like, you guessed it, a piece of plastic. If the dense and enchanting Future Weather is any indication of the forecast for the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next full-length, which is in the works, then fans have much to look forward to.\n\nRelease date: \n25.10.2010 \nQuality: \nVBR \nBuy on Amazon: \nMySpace: \n\nMusic label: \nSecretly Canadian \nCountry: \nUnited States\n\nTracklist:\n01 Come to the City #14\n02 Baby Missles\n03 CominÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Through\n04 A Pile of Tires\n05 CominÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Around\n06 Brothers\n07 Missles Reprise\n08 The History of Plastic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec253a3539908429f15869077ba8fef40448d612","amp;dn":"The+War+On+Drugs+-+Future+Weather+%5B2010%5D+%5B256kbps%5D+HoTT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec253a3539908429f15869077ba8fef40448d612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,37,58,53,57,144,132,41,241,88,105,7,123,168,254,244,4,72,214,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
