A must for both the aspiring and seasoned artist. Uniquely geared to the work of theatre and film artists, this book, for the first time, sets out clearly and concisely the ideas, principles, and character typology of various psychological schools from Freudian, Kleinian, and Jungian to contemporary developments. The practical uses and applications of their theories are graphically demonstrated throughout the book by means of numerous examples and in-depth analyses drawn from classic and contemporary theatrical and cinematic literature. Stanislavskian methods are also discussed. An immensely useful, essential tool for character creation and analysis. Features a foreword by noted acting teacher Alice Spivak.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed3d15c4e6d56f357f417aabc13548229e7003b0","amp;dn":"Tools+and+Techniques+for+Character+Interpretation+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed3d15c4e6d56f357f417aabc13548229e7003b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,61,21,196,230,213,111,53,127,65,122,171,193,53,72,34,158,112,3,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
