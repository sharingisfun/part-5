King of the Croon and Swoon, Nat King Cole&amp;#039;s &quot;Stardust&quot; is probably the most obvious of the young lovers&amp;#039; themes here. Louis Armstrong and Jimmy Durante, ordinarily not the most romantic of sorts, prove themselves worthy contenders with &quot;A Kiss to Build a Dream On&quot; and &quot;As Time Goes By,&quot; respectively. &quot;In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning&quot; gets an elegantly simple treatment from Carly Simon, and Tammy Wynette&amp;#039;s &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; confirms her status as the late, great Queen of Country. The only disappointments with this collection are the absence of heart-wrenching numbers by Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, or even Johnny Mathis; and the inclusion of the horrendous rendition of &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; by the over-rated Celine Dion with Clive Griffin. \n        --Steve Gdula ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70475d1835eaa11f4706cae9b550e2a0652906d3","amp;dn":"Sleepless+in+Seattle+soundtrack+%5B1993%5D+MP3+vbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70475d1835eaa11f4706cae9b550e2a0652906d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,71,93,24,53,234,161,31,71,6,202,233,181,80,226,160,101,41,6,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
