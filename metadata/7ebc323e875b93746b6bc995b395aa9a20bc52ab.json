The Indians didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t save the Pilgrims from starvation by teaching them to grow corn. Thomas Jefferson thought statesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rightsÃ¢â‚¬â€an idea reviled todayÃ¢â‚¬â€were even more important than the ConstitutionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s checks and balances. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“WildÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ West was more peaceful and a lot safer than most modern cities. And the biggest scandal of the Clinton years didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t involve an intern in a blue dress.\n\nSurprised? DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be. In America, where history is riddled with misrepresentations, misunderstandings, and flat-out lies about the people and events that have shaped the nation, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the history you know and then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the truth.\n\nIn 33 Questions About American History YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Not Supposed to Ask, Thomas E. Woods Jr., the New York Times bestselling author of The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History, sets the record straight with a provocative look at the hidden truths about our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historyÃ¢â‚¬â€the ones that have been buried because theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re too politically incorrect to discuss. Woods draws on real scholarshipÃ¢â‚¬â€as opposed to the myths, platitudes, and slogans so many other Ã¢â‚¬Å“historyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ books are based onÃ¢â‚¬â€to ask and answer tough questions about American history, including:\n\n- Did the Founding Fathers support immigration?\n- Was the Civil War all about slavery?\n- Did the Framers really look to the American Indians as the model for the U.S. political system?\n- Was the U.S. Constitution meant to be a Ã¢â‚¬Å“living, breathingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ documentÃ¢â‚¬â€and does it grant the federal government wide latitude to operateas it pleases?\n- Did Bill Clinton actually stop a genocide, as weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re told?\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never know it from the history thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been handed down to us, but the answer to all those questions is no.\n\nWoodsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye-opening exploration reveals how much has been whitewashed from the historical record, overlooked, and skewed beyond recognition. More informative than your last U.S. history class, 33 Questions About American History YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Not Supposed to Ask will have you wondering just how much about your nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been told.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nThomas E.
