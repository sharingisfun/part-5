SMART Recovery focuses on empowerment rather than powerlessness and can be very helpful for those who don't feel at home with 12-step programs.\nThanks by","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:454b5e384d50ab83e60866e0c06381b04887ecea","amp;dn":"SMART+Recovery+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"454b5e384d50ab83e60866e0c06381b04887ecea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,75,94,56,77,80,171,131,230,8,102,224,192,99,129,176,72,135,236,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
