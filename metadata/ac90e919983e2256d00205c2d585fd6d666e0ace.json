James Jensen (Author) \n\n---------\n\nBEYOND THE POWER OF YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND is a book filled with the incredible promise for those readers who may better understand the TRUE relationship between the conscious and subconscious areas of the mind. You will expand your life with greater opportunities and successes. You do not need to take a leap of faith. The principles and techniques presented are scientifically valid and easy to implement.\n\nAs Daniel K. Church, Ph.D. President of Bastyr University explains, &quot;There is a musical form termed Ã¢â‚¬Å“call and responseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which a distinct phrase is played by one musician and a second phrase forms a commentary on or a response to the first phrase. This mirrors a tradition characteristic of African and African-American Christian worship in which the speaker makes a statement and the congregation responds with an affirmation, amplifying and clarifying the initial statement. This work by Murphy and Jensen is an exquisite example of call and responseÃ¢â‚¬â€Murphy asserts, Jensen elucidates. Their subject matter may have sometimes been dismissed as too far out or not based on verifiable scientific evidence, but in page after page the call is a clear, declaratory statement of conviction and the response is an offering of anecdotal evidence which becomes increasingly compelling as the chapters accumulate. If it is not enough to convince the skeptic, it is at least enough to shake the certainty and smugness of its critics. Read this and sing!&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes a book comes along that offers the reader a life changing opportunity. Murphy and Jensen have written one that does just that. I know from first-hand experience how you can improve your life by putting to work the principles and concepts contained in Beyond the Power of Your Subconscious Mind. If you are going to read one book this year, make it this one.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Howard Behar, President, Starbucks Coffee International, retired\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I have seldom read a book that so clearly leaves the reader to better understand the incredible relationship between the conscious and subconscious areas of the mind. I highly recommend it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Jack Canfield, Co-author of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series and a featured teacher in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Secret.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n----------\n\ncreate by Yasser Adnan\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac90e919983e2256d00205c2d585fd6d666e0ace","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+Power+of+Your+Subconscious+Mind+%2C+by+James+Jensen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac90e919983e2256d00205c2d585fd6d666e0ace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,144,233,25,152,62,34,86,208,2,5,194,213,133,253,109,102,110,10,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
