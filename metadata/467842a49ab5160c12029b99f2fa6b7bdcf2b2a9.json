These are supported by two unique sections on gynaecology and obstetrics management, which are tailored to help students revise for exams, especially OSCEs. A brand new chapter covering ethics in obstetrics and gynaecology makes this fully-updated fourth edition the most comprehensive introduction available.\n\nObstetrics &amp; Gynaecology now includes a companion website at www.impeyobgyn.com, featuring self-assessment MCQs and EMQs, chapter summary slides, and all the figures from the book as PowerPoint slides.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:467842a49ab5160c12029b99f2fa6b7bdcf2b2a9","amp;dn":"Obstetrics+and+Gynaecology%2C+4E-+Impey+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"467842a49ab5160c12029b99f2fa6b7bdcf2b2a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,120,66,164,154,181,22,12,18,2,155,153,242,250,107,123,220,242,178,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
