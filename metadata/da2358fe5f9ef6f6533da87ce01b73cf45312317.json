While humans will no longer generally starve to death if we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t preserve food at home (as we once would have done) we still enjoy the self-reliance that doing so brings. \n\n A Beginners Guide to Home Canning &amp; Food Preserving is for anyone wanting to learn the art of Home Canning. The book cover such topics as:\n\n History of Food Preservation\n Definitions of Various Food Preservation Methods\n Food Safety and Safety Precautions\n Sourcing Tools, Equipment and Food\n Altitude Adjustments\n Water Bath Canning Details &amp; Pressure Canning Details\n Recipes Including Jams, Jellies, Butters, Chutneys, Relishes, Pickles and Meat Fish and Poultry\n\n If you are an old hand at food preserving and canning you may even find a new recipe included in book.\n\n Although the canning process is the most labor intensive procedure, all methods promote a sense of pride, accomplishment, and self-reliance. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing like opening the pantry or freezer door on a frigid winterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day, where the snow - already up to the window sills - is coming down so hard you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see your mailbox, and finding row upon row of neatly labeled produce and meats and remembering once again that if the world ended outside your door, your family would still eat well.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tr6Q9FHsL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tr6Q9FHsL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCar Buyer's and Leaser's Negotiating Bible, Third Edition\n\nPublisher: Random House Reference\nWilliam Bragg \n2004 \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0375720677\nISBN-13: 978-0375720673\n272 Pages\nEPUB \n3.60 MB\n\nW.

This book is informed by years of hands-on experience and the wisdom gathered from a generation of homesteaders and small farmers. Starting with planning the garden (plot size, seasonal considerations, getting the most from a small plot) and laying it out (rows, beds, plowing), this book addresses the planning and growing issues for all North American climate zones. Gardeners need to understand (and love) their soil, and the Growing Your Own Vegetables explains it in simple terms, with advice on composting and testing for contamination (so important since this is going to be your food source!). Carla Emery was a very early advocate of gardening without chemical fertilizers, so the approach here is organic all the way. The large part of the book is the crop-by-crop guide to planting, cultivating, and harvesting the delicious vegetables we love to ear: onions, leafy greens, stems and flowers (rhubarb, artichoke, broccoli), roots (spuds, radishes, jicama), grasses &amp; grains (just imagine: your own wheat field!), legumes, gourds, and the nightshade family (that would be tomatoes, peppers, eggplant).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2358fe5f9ef6f6533da87ce01b73cf45312317","amp;dn":"Growing+Your+Own+Vegetables%2CHome+Canning+And+Food+Preserving%2CClo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da2358fe5f9ef6f6533da87ce01b73cf45312317","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,35,88,254,95,158,246,246,83,61,168,124,224,27,115,207,69,49,35,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
