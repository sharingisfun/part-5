It does not hide bad sectors, it really restores them! Hard disk \ndrive is an integral part of every computer. It stores all your information. \nOne of the most prevalent defects of hard drives is bad sectors on the disk \nsurface. Bad sectors are a part of the disk surface which contains not readable, \nbut frequently necessary information. As a result of bad sectors you may have \ndifficulties to read and copy data from your disk, your operating system becomes \nunstable and finally your computer may unable to boot altogether. When a hard \ndrive is damaged with bad sectors, the disk not only becomes unfit for use, but \nalso you risk losing information stored on it. The HDD Regenerator can repair \ndamaged hard disks without affecting or changing existing data. As a result, \npreviously unreadable and inaccessible information is restored.\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d7b8e7ff0c85297a2e7156b41439557195297b2","amp;dn":"HDD+Regenerator+v1.71+Pro+.ISO+-+2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d7b8e7ff0c85297a2e7156b41439557195297b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,123,142,127,240,200,82,151,162,231,21,107,65,67,149,87,25,82,151,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
