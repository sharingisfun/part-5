Join host Jason Silva and deception specialist Apollo Robbins as they visit neuroscientists on the cutting edge of brain research, revealing all that we know-and all we have yet to learn- about what's really going on inside our brains. Twelve episodes are packed with interactive games and try-at-home experiments that will astonish and entertain you, while totally messing with your mind.\n\n\n\n\n7)  Use It or Lose It \nAll the latest research says that your brain needs exercise to stay youthful and fit. Wonder junkie Jason Silva and deception specialist Apollo Robbins are going to put your brain to the test with a serious workout.\n\n8)  Liar Liar \nHost Jason Silva and deception specialist Apollo Robbins break down why we lie and what happens in the brain, even though science tells us that the truth is physiologically and neurologically easier.\n\n9)  Illusion Confusion \nBrain Games reveals how optical illusions are a great way of showing the powerful mechanisms at work that allow your brain to perceive three dimensions.\n\n10)  Battle of the Sexes \nFrom the second you're born, you're a unique individual. You'll make choices about your friends, your career, your relationships, where you live, and how you dress. But one thing you don't get to choose is whether you were born a man or a woman - and that flip of the genetic coin will play a huge role in determining how you think about... well, almost everything. In this episode, we find out once and for all which gender's hard drive is wired better... for doing what.\n\n11)  What You Dont Know \nBrain Games reveals how the &quot;illusion of knowledge&quot; plagues the human brain and why we fall victim to the notion that we understand more than we actually do.\n\n12)  Seeing is Believing \nSeeing is believing, right? Not necessarily. It all depends on your perspective. In this episode of Brain Games, mind-bending illusions will show you the ways in which your visual perceptions can be surprisingly off. Watch as your brain turns beautiful people into scary monsters, and reduces giants to miniatures.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/5331/4u0r.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/5331/4u0r.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9889/gr3o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9889/gr3o.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/9889/55ui.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/9889/55ui.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/42/pv6s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/42/pv6s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/152/o3m3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/152/o3m3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/8585/0oz5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/8585/0oz5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/5728/14cv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/5728/14cv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3858/c66z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3858/c66z.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/8992/31ew.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/8992/31ew.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7a32131d123a3649544b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1757 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 24mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 12\n * Part Size: 282 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://braingames.nationalgeographic.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://braingames.nationalgeographic.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Test%20your%20Brain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Test%20your%20Brain&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3a51ecb68b069e63881f580158e58c3f268003","amp;dn":"NG+Brain+Games+Season+2+07of12+Use+It+Or+Lose+It+PDTV+x264+AAC+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e3a51ecb68b069e63881f580158e58c3f268003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,58,81,236,182,139,6,158,99,136,31,88,1,88,229,140,63,38,128,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
