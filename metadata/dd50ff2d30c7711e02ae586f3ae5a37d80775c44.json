Despite the wide critical acclaim for Wonder's previous works such as Songs in the Key of Life and Innervisions, Hotter than July was his first album eligible for platinum status, as Motown sales records before 1977 were not audited by the RIAA. This was his most successful album in the UK, peaking at #2 and producing four top ten singles.\n\nHotter than July was nominated for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album at the American Music Awards in 1982.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd50ff2d30c7711e02ae586f3ae5a37d80775c44","amp;dn":"Stevie+Wonder+-+Hotter+than+July+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd50ff2d30c7711e02ae586f3ae5a37d80775c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,80,255,45,48,199,113,30,2,174,88,111,58,229,163,125,128,119,92,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
