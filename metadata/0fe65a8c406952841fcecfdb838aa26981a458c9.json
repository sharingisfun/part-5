It was released in 1992.\n\nThe album's title, and much of its thematic material, was inspired by Neil Postman's book Amusing Ourselves to Death. In Postman's later book The End of Education, he remarks on the album: &quot;(...) Roger Waters, once the lead singer of Pink Floyd, was sufficiently inspired by a book of mine to produce a CD called Amused to Death. This fact so elevated my prestige among undergraduates that I am hardly in a position to repudiate him or his kind of music.&quot;\n\nWaters stated in an interview with Rockline on 8 February 1993 that he wanted to use samples of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey on the album. Stanley Kubrick, the director, turned him down on the basis that it would open the door to many other people using the sound sample. Others think that Kubrick refused because Pink Floyd had not allowed him to use music from Atom Heart Mother in his film A Clockwork Orange. Waters has since then used audio of HAL describing his mind being taken away when performing the song live (as an intro, specifically during his &quot;In the Flesh&quot; concert tour, after Kubrick's death, and at the beginning of &quot;Perfect Sense, part I&quot; on the 2015 remix).\n\n&quot;My view is that I've been involved in two absolutely classic albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall,&quot; Waters told Classic Rock. &quot;And if you haven't got Amused to Death, you haven't got the full set. On 19 September 2013, Waters told BBC HardTalk that Amused to Death has been completely underrated.\n\nOn April 15, 2015, Waters announced that the album would be re-released on July 24, 2015, featuring a new 5.1 multichannel audio mix, as well as a new stereo mix. It will be available in a number of formats, including Compact Disc, SACD, Blu-Ray and high-resolution downloads.\n\n\n[b]Audio Specs\n===========\nLength: 1:13:23.857\nLPCM Audio / 5.1 / 96 kHz / 13824 kbps / 24-bit\nLPCM Audio / 5.1 / 48 kHz / 6912 kbps / 24-bit\nLPCM Audio / 2.0 / 96 kHz / 4608 kbps / 24-bit[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe65a8c406952841fcecfdb838aa26981a458c9","amp;dn":"Roger+Waters+-+Amused+to+Death+%281992%29+%282015+Remastered%29+BluRayAu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe65a8c406952841fcecfdb838aa26981a458c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,230,90,140,64,105,82,132,31,206,207,219,131,138,162,105,129,164,88,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
