This is because the ElevatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true strength lies in their moodier and psychedelic material. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReverberationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with its weighty distortion, pounding bass and beat, hypnotically swirling guitar riffs and EricksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s calm-yet-disturbed vocals. The gorgeous slow-burning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKingdom of Heaven,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ drenched in moody blues guitar, is a highlight and one of a trio of tracks not written by Erickson and/or Hall.\n\nThis album is truly one of the great works of rock. It stands the test of time, sounding as fresh to these ears in 2008 as it did the first time I heard it in my teens (and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure as fresh as it sounded to ears in the late 60s). Its bold concepts, both lyrically and musically, are still daring and avant-mainstream today. The sounds just as powerful. The music just as remarkable, showcasing the ElevatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s masterful control over mood. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s little wonder the Elevators, and particularly the tragic and triumphant figure of Roky Erickson, inspired and influenced so many major and diverse figures in music including Henry Rollins, ZZ Top, the Allman Brothers, Janis Joplin, the White Stripes, Sonic Youth and many more. Undoubtedly they will remain a staple influence for generations.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;You're Gonna Miss Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31\n   2. &quot;Roller Coaster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n   3. &quot;Splash 1&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n   4. &quot;Reverberation (Doubt)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n   5. &quot;Don't Fall Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03\n   6. &quot;Fire Engine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n   7. &quot;Thru the Rhythm&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n   8. &quot;You Don't Know (How Young You Are)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n   9. &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n  10. &quot;Monkey Island&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40\n  11. &quot;Tried to Hide&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n\n 2005 Reissue\n\n  12. &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot; - 5:15\n  13. &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot; - 2:35\n  14. &quot;I'm Gonna Love You Too&quot; - 1:53\n  15. &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; - 6:18\n  16. &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; - 2:47\n  17. &quot;The Word&quot; - 2:45\n  18. &quot;Gloria&quot; - 3:56\n  19. &quot;She Lives (In a Time of Her Own)&quot; - 3:01\n  20. &quot;We Sell Soul&quot; [The Spades] - 3:19\n  21. &quot;You're Gonna Miss Me&quot; [Live; The Spades] - 3:24","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c63a2cca2ac58a02f4b6aeb3580c4c8958c0da1a","amp;dn":"13Th+Floor+Elevators-The+Psychedelic+Sounds+Of...+%281966%29%282005+Ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c63a2cca2ac58a02f4b6aeb3580c4c8958c0da1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,58,44,202,42,197,138,2,244,182,174,179,88,12,76,137,88,192,218,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
