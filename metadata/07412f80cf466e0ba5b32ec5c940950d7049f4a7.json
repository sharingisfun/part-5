Filled with stirring music and songs, this powerfully moving and imaginative drama is a show of phenomenal inventiveness. At its heart are astonishing lifesized puppets by South AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Handspring Puppet Company, who bring breathing, galloping, charging horses to thrilling life on stage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07412f80cf466e0ba5b32ec5c940950d7049f4a7","amp;dn":"WAR+HORSE+NTLive+02.27.2014+HDTV+1080p+AC3+MME","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07412f80cf466e0ba5b32ec5c940950d7049f4a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,65,47,128,207,70,110,11,165,179,46,197,201,64,149,13,112,73,244,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
