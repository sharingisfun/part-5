All his very successful '90s albums on Fonovisa are bypassed, written off as prehistory, so the spotlight shines only on his English-language singles of the new millennium: the club tracks and syrupy slow songs that gave him a significant number of crossover hits. With the exception of a couple of minor blips on the charts like 2000's &quot;Sad Eyes,&quot; all these are here, starting with 1999's &quot;Bailamos&quot; and &quot;The Rhythm Divine,&quot; running through 2000's &quot;Be with You&quot; and 2001's &quot;Hero,&quot; stopping for 2004's &quot;Not in Love,&quot; winding up with 2007's &quot;Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song)&quot; and wrapping up with two new duets, &quot;Away&quot; with Sean Garrett and &quot;Takin' Back My Love&quot; with Ciara. While this approach may lop off half of his career, it also does exactly what hits collections should do: it gives the casual listener the hits they want to hear and nothing else.
