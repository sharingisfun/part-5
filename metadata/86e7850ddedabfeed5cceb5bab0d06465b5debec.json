With this comprehensive guide, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn just how powerful the combination of C# 5.0 and .NET 4.5 can be. Author Ian Griffiths guides you through C# 5.0 fundamentals and teaches you techniques for building web and desktop applications, including Windows 8-style apps.\n\nCompletely rewritten for experienced programmers, this book provides many code examples to help you work with the nuts and bolts of C# code, such as generics, dynamic typing, and the new asynchronous programming features. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also get up to speed on XAML, ASP.NET, LINQ, and other .NET tools.\n\n- Discover how C# supports fundamental coding features such as classes, other custom types, collections, and error handling\n- Understand the differences between dynamic and static typing in C#\n- Query and process diverse data sources such as in-memory object models, databases, and XML documents with LINQ\n- Use .NETÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multithreading features to exploit your computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parallel processing capabilities\n- Learn how the new asynchronous language features can help improve application responsiveness and scalability\n- Use XAML to create Windows 8-style, phone, and classic desktop applications\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
