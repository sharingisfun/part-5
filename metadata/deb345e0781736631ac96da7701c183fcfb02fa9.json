Jerome. It was published in 1900, eleven years after his most famous work, \n\nThree Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog).The sequel brings back the three companions who figured in Three Men in a Boat, this time on a bicycle tour through the German Black Forest. D. C. Browning's introduction to the 1957 Everyman's edition says &quot;Like most sequels, it has been compared unfavourably with its parent story, but it was only a little less celebrated than Three Men in a Boat and was for long used as a school book in Germany.&quot;\n\nJeremy Nicholas of the Jerome K. Jerome Society regards it as a &quot;comic masterpiece&quot; containing &quot;set pieces&quot; as funny or funnier than those in its predecessor, but, taken as a whole, not as satisfying due to the lack of as strong a unifying thread.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nAudio CD\n\nPublisher: Tantor Media; Unabridged\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1400131014\nASIN: B007MXXAFU\nProduct Dimensions: 6.7 x 6.5 x 1 inches\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
