But it's something of a red herring. Right at the fifteen-second mark, the guitars blitz out louder and harder than anything on their self-titled debut. The gargantuan distortion recalls nothing less than prime-era Smashing Pumpkins, which makes sense considering Belong was produced by Flood and mixed by Alan Moulder, aka the guys who helped craft the sounds of Pumpkins classics like Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, not to mention records by My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails, U2, PJ Harvey, Depeche Mode, and many more. Basically, if you grew up in the 90s, your ears are subconsciously attuned the studio wizardry of Flood and Alan Moulder.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c9da4a237ccdf93318b6359d2cbc60692777e2","amp;dn":"The+Pains+of+Being+Pure+at+Heart+-+Belong+%5Bmp3-320-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c9da4a237ccdf93318b6359d2cbc60692777e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,201,218,74,35,124,205,249,51,24,182,53,157,44,188,96,105,39,119,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
