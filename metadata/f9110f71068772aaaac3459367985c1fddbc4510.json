In her theatrical \r\nfilm debut, the British actress Amanda Root stars as protagonist Anne \r\nElliot, while CiarÃ¡n Hinds plays her romantic interest, Captain \r\nFrederick Wentworth. The film is set in 19th century England, nine \r\nyears after Anne was persuaded by others to reject Wentworth's proposal \r\nof marriage. Persuasion follows the two as they become reacquainted \r\nwith each other, while supporting characters threaten to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe film was adapted by the writer Nick Dear, who considered the story \r\nmore mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised it as one of \r\nrealism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story of two \r\npeople separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys \r\nAnne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the \r\ncharacter's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was \r\nshot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's \r\ndevelopment from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.\r\n\r\nFILE INFO:\r\n\r\nContainer.......: mkv\r\nFile Size.......: 800 MB\r\nRun Time........: 01:47:05\r\nVideo Resolution: 782x480 (1,63:1)\r\nVideo Codec.....: x264 (Profile Level:   )\r\nVideo Quality...: Constant RF: 22,0\r\nAudio...........: English, aac, 2.0 channels, 160 kbps\r\nSoft-Coded Subs.: English, French, Spanish (VobSub, muxed in)\r\n                  English (Closed Captions, separate .ASS)\r\n                  English (separate .SRT) \r\nFramerate.......: 23,976\r\nSource..........: DVD (NTSC)\r\nSample..........: Included\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n \nhttps://s14.postimg.org/o3kabwofl/Persuasion_1995_Screenshot_1.png \nhttps://s14.postimg.org/t3mbxljg1/Persuasion_1995_Screenshot_2.png \nhttps://s14.postimg.org/7v8ng64z5/Persuasion_1995_Screenshot_3.png \nhttps://s14.postimg.org/iw3sl6x81/Persuasion_1995_Screenshot_4.png","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9110f71068772aaaac3459367985c1fddbc4510","amp;dn":"%5BJane+Austen%5D+Persuasion+%282007%29+DVDRip+480p+x264+aac+2.0+%5BMKV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9110f71068772aaaac3459367985c1fddbc4510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,17,15,113,6,135,114,170,170,195,69,147,103,152,92,31,221,188,69,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
