What is surprising is that it is so enjoyable in a light, unforced way. Worl-A-Girl note the unlikeliness of Jamaica having a bobsled team; Diana King covers Bob Marley's &quot;Stir It Up&quot;; and Wailing Souls cover Talking Heads' &quot;Wild Wild Life.&quot; Best of all (if somewhat redundant), Jimmy Cliff got his first chart hit in 23 years with a cover of the 21-year-old &quot;I Can See Clearly Now,&quot; by Johnny Nash. ~ William Ruhlmann\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.
