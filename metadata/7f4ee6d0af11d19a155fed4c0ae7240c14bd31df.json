The feds know who to call: Jonathan Grave and his elite rescue team. Their mission: find the dead man's teenage son, who's on the run--and off the grid--with crucial information that must not fall into the wrong hands. There's one problem: the boy's bodyguard is a security specialist with unusual talents, and she's not giving up without a fight. Only by bringing them both back alive can Grave expose the traitor in the highest levels of power--and prevent an all-out nuclear war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f4ee6d0af11d19a155fed4c0ae7240c14bd31df","amp;dn":"End+Game+by+John+Gilstrap+%28Retail+-+New+Release+-+Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f4ee6d0af11d19a155fed4c0ae7240c14bd31df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,78,230,208,175,17,209,154,21,95,237,76,10,231,36,12,20,189,49,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
