Go to kobobooks.com and choose books that you want uploaded and request them in the comments.\nNote: Comics on that site are in some weird ass format that only works on iOS and Android. To get those I have to go through the tired process of screen shots of each page, then create a word file, then convert to epub. Its a pain because even then the images may not show up right on some devices/apps.\n\nSupport Amas school of technology. The only school of its kind in an entire 3rd world country that doesn't force poor people to pay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78608aee20110667ba782b6cfe8fe10f714160a3","amp;dn":"Odd+Thomas+Bundle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78608aee20110667ba782b6cfe8fe10f714160a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,96,138,238,32,17,6,103,186,120,43,108,254,143,225,15,113,65,96,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
