They found drummer Jeff Fabb and started the band as Dying Star. Unhappy with their musical direction, they changed their name to In This Moment and gained two band members, guitarist Blake Bunzel and bassist Josh Newell. In late 2005, bassist Newell left the band and was replaced by Pascual Romero, who in turn was quickly replaced by Jesse Landry. Landry was replaced by Kyle Konkiel in 2009 and Konkiel was replaced by Travis Johnson in 2010. Jeff Fabb and Blake Bunzel left the band in 2011, and were replaced by Tom Hane and Randy Weitzel respectively.\n\n\nAlbums\n\n\n2007 - Beautiful Tagedy\n2009 - The Dream\n2010 - A Star-Crossed Wasteland\n2012 - Blood\n\n\nMusic Videos\n\nBeautiful Tragedy\nBlood\nForever\nPrayers\nThe Gun Show\nThe Promise\nCall Me (Blondie Cover)\n\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83b3d803e0ef47690ddc7c11f8d6320921d59751","amp;dn":"In+This+Moment+Discography+Mp3+Vbr+%2B+Vids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83b3d803e0ef47690ddc7c11f8d6320921d59751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,179,216,3,224,239,71,105,13,220,124,17,248,214,50,9,33,213,151,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
