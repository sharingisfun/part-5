Since then, I have had many requests for certain albums at a higher bit rate. This is one of those albums. Many of these are already available at lower bit rates as part of certain compilations IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve put out, but the requests for higher quality have mounted, so here ya go. All albums are ripped to 320 kbps mp3, and are properly tagged and labeled.\n\nRambam1776 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clancy_Brothers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clancy_Brothers&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Clancy Brothers were an influential Irish folk music singing group, most popular in the 1960s, who are often credited with popularizing Irish traditional music in the United States. The brothers were Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Clancy, Tom Clancy, Bobby Clancy and Liam Clancy. They are best known for their work with Tommy Makem, recording dozens of albums together as The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. They were a primary influence on a young Bob Dylan and on the reemergence of folk music in the U.S.\n\n\n\nCLANCY BROTHERS - DUBLINERS - IRISH DRINKING SONGS (1993 ALBUM)\n\nDubliners - Drink It Up Men\nDubliners - Maloney Wants A Drink\nDubliners - The Pub With No Beer\nDubliners - Whiskey In the Jar\nThe Clancy Brothers - A Jug Of Punch\nThe Clancy Brothers - All For Me Grog\nThe Clancy Brothers - Beer, Beer, Beer\nThe Clancy Brothers - Galway Bay\nThe Clancy Brothers - Jug Of This\nThe Clancy Brothers - Mountain Dew\nThe Clancy Brothers - The Juice Of The Barley\nThe Clancy Brothers - The Moonshiner\nThe Clancy Brothers - The Parting Glass\nThe Clancy Brothers - Tim Finnegan's Wake\nThe Clancy Brothers - Water Is Alright In Tay\nThe Clancy Brothers - Whiskey, You're the Divil\n\n\nTHE BEST OF THE CLANCY BROTHERS &amp;
