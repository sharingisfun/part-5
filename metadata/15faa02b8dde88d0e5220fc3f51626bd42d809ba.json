Good training for the rhythm guitar!&quot;, January 21, 2005\nBy M. C Cardoso &quot;marciohaas&quot; (Berkeley, CA United States) - See all my reviews\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â«The way I see it, the &quot;Chord Progressions&quot; book/CD is a great companion to the main Musician Institute book for Rhythm Guitar, the &quot;Complete Guide&quot;. While the &quot;Guide&quot;, another excellent book, builds your playing technique and chord vocabulary and can be used as the main &quot;course book&quot;, &quot;Chord Progressions&quot; provides dozens of realistic examples of rhythm guitar as applied in popular music.\n&quot;Chord Progressions&quot; is a great value for the money! It is useful for the beginner and intermediate guitar player, as it lays out smart chord progressions and includes 100 well-recorded tracks covering most styles in American popular music, from folk rock to heavy rock, from country to new wave, from soul &amp; funk and reggae to classic rock ballads. Believe me, there are lots! And the guitar sounds right on every track.\n\nIf you are a well-rounded music lover that enjoys different styles, particularly from the '60s to the '80s, this book will have something for you. As for me, I am committed to learning ALL of the progressions. I found the music fun and they are a great source for songwriting and jamming inspiration.\nPlaying the tracks in enjoyable in its own right, but the greatest benefits will come from studying the progressions (rhythm, harmony and melody) and relating it to the famous and worthy music that guided the making of this book.\nThe author introduces EACH progression with very welcomed info on harmony, suggested playing technique, tricky parts and what makes the track effective. Do not overlook Mr. Kolb's comments as they clarify the &quot;lessons&quot; you should take from the exercise.\n\nAs a final remark, please note that the level of difficulty DOES vary from track to track, but NOT in a gradual way. Since the exercises are separated by style rather than difficulty, you might be stuck on a tough &quot;country rock&quot; lick, but if you move a few pages ahead you might find a rock ballad that is much easier. That is just an example, but the message is: browse through the whole book - there are lots to enjoy. Some tracks you might be able to play right away, others will take considerable practice to sound right... But in the end, by the time you master this fine book, you will be ready to join most bar bands in the world! OR perhaps write a hit song based on a &quot;classic&quot; progression.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\n\nAmazon.com\n\n\n\nCheck out my other torrents for more music/guitar related stuff ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15faa02b8dde88d0e5220fc3f51626bd42d809ba","amp;dn":"Chord+Progressions+for+Guitar-+Tom+Kolb+%28pdf+%2B+CD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15faa02b8dde88d0e5220fc3f51626bd42d809ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,250,160,43,141,222,136,208,229,34,15,195,245,22,38,189,66,216,9,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
