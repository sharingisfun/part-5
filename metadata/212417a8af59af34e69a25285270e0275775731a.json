Gracyk\n2007\nENGLISH\nISBN  : 0472069837, 0472099833 \n257 pages \nPDF \n13 MB\n\n It has long been assumed that people who prefer Led Zeppelin to Mozart live aesthetically impoverished lives. But why? In Listening to Popular Music, award-winning popular music scholar Theodore Gracyk argues that aesthetic value is just as important in popular listening as it is with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œseriousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ music. And we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to treat popular music as art in order to recognize its worth. Aesthetic values are realized differently in different musical styles, and each requires listening skills that people must learn. Boldly merging insights from popular music studies, aesthetic theory, cognitive science, psychology, identity theory, and cultural studies, Gracyk crafts an innovative study that argues that understanding aesthetic value is crucial to the enjoyment of all forms of music. Listening to Popular Music thus offers a new, general framework for understanding what it means to appreciate music, showing that an informed preference for popular music is a response to real values of the music, including aesthetic values. &quot;Finally, a book on aesthetics that's philosophically grounded, anti-elitist, and tailored to popular music. Much needed and deftly achieved.&quot;\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½William Echard, Department of Music, and Institute for Comparative Studies in Literature, Art, and Culture, Carleton University &quot;A sophisticated account of aesthetic value in popular music that revealingly challenges orthodoxies of cultural studies and traditional aesthetics.&quot;\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Stephen Davies, Department of Philosophy, University of Auckland, and author of The Philosophy of Art &quot;Gracyk's arguments are thoughtful, clear, and persuasive, and it's refreshing to see him expose the flaws in commonly repeated critiques of popular music. This book will challenge open-minded doubters to take popular music seriously.&quot;\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mark Katz, Assistant Professor of Music, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and author of Capturing Sound: How Technology Has Changed Music Theodore Gracyk is Department Chair and Professor of Philosophy at Minnesota State University Moorhead. He is the author of Rhythm and Noise: An Aesthetics of Rock and I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity, which won the 2002 IASPM-US Woody Guthrie Book Award.

Percival\n2006 \n ENGLISH\nISBN  : 0911650091 \n1081 Pages\nPDF \n3.61 MB\n\n Greetings Dear Reader,\n So you embarked on your search and eventually were led to this book. As you begin to read it you will probably find it to be unlike anything you have read before. Most of us did. Many of us had difficulties at first in comprehending. But as we read on, a page at a time, we discovered that PercivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique system of conveying his knowledge called into use faculties long dormant within us and that our capacity to understand grew with each reading. This led us to wonder how it could be that we had been without this knowledge for so long. Then the reasons for that also became clear.\n In degree virtually unknown in ancient or modern literature, the author presents a remarkably complete exposition of the origin and development of the universe. He also indicates the source, purpose and ultimate destination of the human. The value of this information is inestimable as it not only provides a context in which to locate ourselves in the universal cosmology, but helps us to understand our fundamental purpose. This is significant because as our existence is made more comprehensible, the desire to transform our lives is also awakened.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picload.org/image/rggrrrd/001f1f9f.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picload.org/image/rggrrrd/001f1f9f.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;\n[b][quote][color=Green]\n\nThe Ten Questions: Walter Cronkite Would Have Asked About Health Care Reform&quot; by Kenneth A. Fisher \n\n\n KF \nKenneth A. Fisher, M.D\n2011 \nENGLISH\nISBN  : n/a | \n137 pages | \nPDF\n1.52 MB \n\n Here is the information that you need to be able to ask important questions about health care in America. This book offers experience-driven insights gained from a physician who wants to provide citizens with the health care information that they deserve. Any concerned individual should be able to ask relevant and illuminating questions, such as: Why is our health care so expensive? Why does our health care system cost us jobs? And why, if we already spend so much, do we have to spend more to provide universal coverage, especially when other countries do so at far less cost? This book provides the information to help you better understand those forces, and presents economically viable solutions.

Could it be true that natural selection produced brains preprogrammed with multiplication tables? Read a few pages, though, and you'll see that Professor Butterworth has more than a little sympathy for the arithmetically challenged, and indeed confesses that he too has a hard time with figures. His thesis isn't that we are born doing mathematics, but that we are born with a faculty for learning mathematics, much like our ability to learn language. He goes on to argue that unique individual differences in this faculty combine with our educational experiences to make us either lightning calculators or klutzes who can't work out the right tip. \n Butterworth's style is perfect for his subject, seamlessly weaving scholarly analysis with down-to-earth humour and practical examples that will satisfy the researcher and the lay reader alike. Drawing on archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, and his own neuropsychology, he makes his case like a masterful attorney while remaining careful to leave room for scientific falsification. The history of counting is engrossing and will be new to many readers, as it has been a rather arcane field until recently--but it's just one of the many new vistas opened for the readers of What Counts. -- Rob Lightner\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Dvr6Ju6DL._SS500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Dvr6Ju6DL._SS500_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n[b][quote][color=Brown]\n\nOpposites as Equals: Standard Differences Between Men and Women and How to Resolve Them\n\n\n\n Westside Publishing \nRichard Driscoll, Ph.D. , with Nancy Ann Davis, Ph.D.\n2009 \nENGLISH\nISBn :  0963412663 \n220 pages \nPDF \n1.15 MB \n\n Current research shows vast differences between the sexes that are not going away. In Opposites as Equals husband and wife psychologists Richard Driscoll, Ph.D., and Nancy Ann Davis, Ph.D. explore gender, patriarchy, chivalry, the battle of the sexes, conflict resolution, modern equality, and the benefits of marriage. Men are seen to be considerably more intrigued by casual sex and are often opportunists, but try to conceal it. Women are more easily offended and are more insistent in arguments, while insisting that it is not so. Men are more highly stressed and confused in conflict with women, but consider themselves inadequate rather than merely normal. Men tend to concede, placate, or withdraw in arguments, which women misinterpret as indifference. Insistence is a viable genetic tactic for women, to command a commitment, whereas avoiding conflict can be a safety play for men, to avoid offending the women who might carry their genes into the next generation. A woman who gets upset wants a man to stay involved and talk it out with her, instead of vanishing, while a man wants a woman to control her emotions and not be so upset. Nature seems to program women to be more comfortable with confrontations, while appearing more troubled, and to program men to be more highly stressed, while appearing as confident as possible. Equality matters, and relationships are best when men and women participate about equally. As men withdraw amid confrontations, relationships turn emotionally barren or are permanently broken. The authors suggest that men might be more forthright about their experiences and stay involved, while women might soften their anger to level the playing field. Dual standards continue everywhere, although idealists expect us to treat men and women the same. Even the familiar double standard applies only among family and friends, while for outsiders it reverses itself. You are more accepting of an unknown woman who partakes of casual relations with your brother, but quicker to condemn the unknown man who takes casual advantage of your sister. We struggle to protect women against bad men, while we expect men to take care of themselves. And we expect men to compensate women for sexual favors, while it is improper to acknowledge it and most of us would be readily offended by the mere suggestion. The authors caution that we can no longer afford to so misunderstand our opposites. Each misunderstanding is a potential troublemaker, lurking in the shadows, ready to trip us up or send us chasing after another rainbow. Relationships between men and women are becoming briefer, more narcissistic, and increasingly bitter. One in three women are found to strongly resent men, while one in six men strongly resent women. Complaints about men are now commonplace, and it is easy to conclude that the battle of the sexes is tilting against men. Four in 10 American children are born to single women, and the traditional family has become an alternative lifestyle. Once we see what we ordinarily overlook, we can plan ahead and program in the brighter futures we would wish to see. We will find the answers behind the masquerades, amidst the real men and women we ought to recognize as ourselves.
