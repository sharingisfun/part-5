Kane and Abel proved to be his best-selling work, reaching number one on the New York Times bestsellers list.\n\nAlongside his literary work, Jeffrey Howard Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, was also a Member of Parliament (1969Ã¢â‚¬â€œ74), and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party (1985Ã¢â‚¬â€œ86). His political career ended with his conviction and subsequent imprisonment (2001Ã¢â‚¬â€œ03) for perjury and perverting the course of justice.\nWhile in prison, he wrote the three-volume memoir A Prison Diary. His prison term also served as inspiration for several of the short stories in his short story book, &quot;Cat O' Nine Tales&quot;. \n\nHere are the E-Books in this torrent.\n\nShort stories:\nA Quiver Full of Arrows (1980)\nA Twist in the Tale (1989)\nTwelve Red Herrings (1994)\nTo Cut a Long Story Short (2000)\nCat O'Nine Tales (2006)\nAnd Thereby Hangs a Tale (2010)\n\nClifton Chronicles:\nOnly Time Will Tell (2011)\nThe Sins of the Father (2012)\n\nKane and Abel series:\nShall We Tell the President?

In fact, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t consider doc, rtf and pdf as proper E-Books, given their rigidity. However, most of these ArcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books were in pdf format, so I had to convert them to epub and mobi. I had to write several macros and took me a couple of days to do a proper conversion and cleaning job.  \nSo please, please enjoy them!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2af420d333a4ced39644657ff0ac07086d354a","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+Archer+25+E-Books+%28epub+and+mobi+formats%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2af420d333a4ced39644657ff0ac07086d354a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,42,244,32,211,51,164,206,211,150,68,101,127,240,172,7,8,109,53,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
