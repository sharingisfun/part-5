It starts with lots of mistakes. Willie too close to the mic making it pop, Johnnie timing all off, missed chords. But they push through like the legends they are and it ends knowing you were in the presence of greatness.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\nBy DanD VINE VOICE\nThis is one of those intimate, legendary concerts that people dream of attending. And while you probably weren't there, you will at least FEEL like you were there, as you listen to this CD--all the songs, all the anecdotes, all the banter...it's captured on VH1 STORYTELLERS, one of the best CDs you could ever hope to purchase.\n\nHow good is this album? Well, if the 5-star rating wasn't evidence enough, and if the presence of two of the best singer/songwriters ever isn't enough, the how about a recap of the album's highlights: namely, all fifteen tracks. Two voices, two guitars...songs such as &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot; are given new life, with other classics (such as &quot;Crazy,&quot; &quot;Always on My Mind,&quot; &quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; &quot;Don't Take Your Guns to Town,&quot; and &quot;Me and Paul&quot;) revitalized and sounding as sweet as ever. Cash's haunting Vietnam-era track &quot;Drive On&quot; blends in perfectly with Willie's autobiographical &quot;Me and Paul&quot;--two songs of different subjects, with different atmospheres, blending together because they are performed by two friends.\n\nJohnny Cash and Willie Nelson are the best music can get, and they're on one album. Can you resist? Probably. But why the heck would you want to?\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohnny Cash &amp; Willie Nelson - VH1 Storytellers\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: \nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 59 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
