With two detunable VCOs and two sub-oscillators per voice, the PROMARS is easily one of the most deep and rich sounding monosynths ever created. Designed for SYSTEM-1 as well as Mac and PC hosts, the new PROMARS uses Analog Circuit Behavior to faithfully recreate every detail of the incredibly warm, dense sound of the original, with a level of authenticity that can only come from Roland.\n\nSH-2 V101\n\nThe SH-2 PLUG-OUT Software Synthesizer is a total reproduction of the classic SH-2 Synthesizer from 1979. Renowned for its raw vintage tone, the SH-2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dual VCO plus sub oscillator configuration dishes out devastatingly fat basses, edgy leads, and wild effects. Designed for SYSTEM-1 as well as Mac or PC hosts, the new SH-2 uses Analog Circuit Behavior technology to faithfully recreate the warm, rich sound of the original with a level of authenticity that can only come from Roland.\n\nSH-101 V102\n\nhe SH-101 PLUG-OUT Software Synthesizer is a complete reproduction of the iconic SH-101ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½right down to the fine details and odd quirks that make it one of the most popular classic synthesizers of all time. Based on Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology, it not only reproduces the SH-101ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legendary sounds, but faithfully recreates the very behavior of its analog circuitryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all with a level of authenticity that could only come from the company that created the original.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINSTRUCTIONS\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Run All installers \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Install SH101 manualy .\nCopy SH-101.component to /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components \nCopy SH-101.vst3 to  /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/Roland\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Activations:\nDelete /Library/Application Support/Roland\nCopy PLUG_OUT_ALL/Activations/Roland  folder to  /Library/Application Support/\n-Open your DAW load plug-out plugin \n-Have FUN!!!!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (03)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bce5fe2afc9af70a1e349761e003b71bf6c6d6c","amp;dn":"Roland+PLUG-OUT+Bundle+OS+X+%5BREGGED-PitChShifTeR%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bce5fe2afc9af70a1e349761e003b71bf6c6d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,206,95,226,175,201,175,112,161,227,73,118,30,0,59,113,191,108,109,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
