Created by Dave Wasson, the series is a true homage to Jay Ward&amp;#039;s Peabody and Sherman. Time Squad explores the humorous, yet unknown events in our world&amp;#039;s history.\n\nThe story involves an orphan, Otto Osworth, who happens to meet two time travelers from 100 million years in the future. Time Squad officer Buck Tuddrussel, an overly excited, trigger-happy time cop, and his partner, the Larry 3000, a communication robot. The two end up taking Otto under their wing because of his extensive knowledge of world history. In an effort to enforce the past to protect the future, the trio travels back in time to pivotal points in history to correct them. With Otto&amp;#039;s knowledge of the past, Larry&amp;#039;s technical know-how, and Officer Tuddrussel&amp;#039;s brute force, the squad travels from era to era convincing historical figures to stick to their original in plans to maintain the time-space continuum.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/mike18xx/TimeSquad.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/mike18xx/TimeSquad.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by:\nDave Wasson, Larry Leichliter\n\nWritten by:\nDave Wasson, Carlos Ramos, Michael Karnow\n\nCast:\nBeauregard &quot;Officer Buck&quot; Tuddrussel: Rob Paulsen\nThe Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; 3000: Mark Hamill\nOtto Osworth: Pamela Segall\n\nEncoded by dummy (HQ preview):\n101, 103, 104, 107, 108, 109\nVideo: 640x480, 23.867 fps, ~NTSC, XviD, ~900 kbps\nAudio: mp3, stereo 2.0, 48 kHz, 128 kbps, CBR\n\nEncoded by Dr_Toons (MQ preview):\n102, 105-a, 106, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 201, 202, 203, 204-a, 205, 206, 207, 208, 210\nVideo: 512x384, 29.97 fps, NTSC, DivX 5.0, 904 kbps\nAudio: mp3, stereo 2.0, 44.1 kHz, 128 kbps, CBR\n105-b, 204-b\nVideo: 640x480, 29.97 fps, NTSC, DivX 5.0, 1011 kbps\nAudio: mp3, stereo 2.0, 44.1 kHz, 128 kbps, CBR\n\nUnknown encoder (LQ preview):\n209\nVideo: 320x240, 30 fps, ~NTSC, DivX 5.0, 555 kbps\nAudio: mp3, stereo 2.0, 32 kHz, 64 kbps, CBR\n\nExtras:\nArtwork, moving storyboards, Time Travel game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c106cef093788e3536d260bd05e1b5d17ac835","amp;dn":"Time+Squad+Season+1+2+complete+Cartoon+Network","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4c106cef093788e3536d260bd05e1b5d17ac835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,193,6,206,240,147,120,142,53,54,210,96,189,5,225,181,209,122,200,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
