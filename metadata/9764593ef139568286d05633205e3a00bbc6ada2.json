ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire\n to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. After Wood's departure following the band's debut record,\n Lynne wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.\nDespite early singles success in the United Kingdom, the band were initially more successful in the United States, \nbilled as &quot;The English guys with the big fiddles&quot;.They gained a cult following despite lukewarm reviews back in \ntheir native United Kingdom. By the mid-1970s, they had become one of the biggest-selling acts in music.\n From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated 27 Top-40 hit singles in both the UK and the US, with 20 Top 20 UK singles\n and 15 Top-20 US singles (as charted by Billboard magazine). The band also holds the record for having the most \nBillboard Hot 100 Top 40 hits of any group in US chart history without ever having a number one single.\nELO collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA and 38 BPI awards,and sold over 50 million records worldwide during the group's active\n period of recording and touring.\n\n[b]This box set is the definitive document of Electric Light Orchestra's classic recordings. Each album features \nrare bonus tracks, including numerous alternate versions and unreleased tracks. Each album is packaged in a\n replica mini-LP-style sleeve reproducing that album's original cover art.[/b]\n\n\n===========================================\n\nAlbums included:\n\n1. No Answer\n2.
