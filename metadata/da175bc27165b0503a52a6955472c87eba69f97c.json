Like Activision's Vampire: The Masquerade: Redemption, Bloodlines is set in White Wolf, Inc.'s Vampire: The Masquerade universe, but it is not a sequel to the earlier game. The game allows the player to choose one of several different vampire clans and progress through the game according to the different strengths and weaknesses of the player's character, as in its paper and pencil role playing origins.\n\nBloodlines is notable for being the first game along with Half-Life 2 to use Valve's Source engine, which allows the game to be played from either the first-person or third-person shooter perspective. There were many technical and playability bugs in the first version of Bloodlines, but none were judged to be serious enough to delay shipping the game. After Bloodlines was released to the public, Activision compiled a list of problems customers were reporting to its customer service department and on various Vampire websites. It then authorized Troika to spend a week creating a patch to address the most serious issues. However, Troika's inability to find revenue from another project had already forced the developer to lay off all its employees in two waves, except for the three owners: Jason Anderson, Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain. Despite this, several employees continued to work without pay on the Version 1.2 patch, which after three weeks was released on December 22, 2004.\n\nUnable to find additional work, Troika disestablished in February 2005,leaving behind an essentially unfinished game with numerous remaining bugs. Fans of Bloodlines continued to create and release unofficial patches to address this situation.\n\nThis is a new Release of Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines. While the original release and many other releases did contain all the necessary files for a clean install of Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, they were flawed by Vista installation problems, stability issues, crack problems, and poor documentation. By converting the content to a portable steam format with a single installer, providing working cracks and better documentation, and including the Official and Unofficial Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines patches, these issues have been resolved. Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, is one of the best RPG's to come into existence and is a tribute to the unpaid work of its former developers at Troika.\n\nThis release is intended to provide accessibility to those individuals who found difficulty in utilizing the Federation's original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines release. It has the advantages of being portable, smaller, updated (to the newest Unofficial patch) and shows increased stability. Because of these advantages this release is intended to replace all previous Federation Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines releases.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to your computer through the trial of this game. This mod has been tested to work \non Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this release took many hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nThe stability of the game only exists thanks to the tireless efforts of the Jason Anderson, Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain who in conjunction with the aforementioned unpaid Troika employees created the final official patch. None of the aforementioned individuals support or condone your pirating of Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines. The Federation released their work without their permission.\n\nThe Unofficial Patch was made by Dan Upright and then continued by Werner &quot;Wesp5&quot; Spahl and members of the Planet Vampire community. Neither Dan Upright, Werner Spahl, or the Planet Vampire community support or condone your  pirating of Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines. The Federation released their work without their permission. It should be noted that as the unofficial patch was created for the original architecture of the game engine (not steam) its porting was incredibly complex and is a credit to the Federation Members who worked on it.\n.III.\nThe playability for the Crack-Mod is only available thanks to the tireless efforts of the Steamless Underground Team (http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewforum.php?f=10) who neither support nor condone your pirating of Half-Life 2. If you enjoy this game send them your thanks through the Steamless Underground Community forums. This release makes use of the SteamEMU crack.\n.IV.\nThis game can only work on single player as it does not possess any multiplayer content. \n.V.\nTo all the Fans, Friends, Foes, Members and Affiliates, of the FEDERATION:\n\n\t\t\t-----------------------\n\t\t\t|THANKS FOR EVERYTHING| \n                        -----------------------\n\nBecause of you we are &quot;STILL UNDERGROUND&quot; and &quot;STILL ALIVE&quot;.\n[54686f73652057686f204b6e6f772055732043616e2046696e64205573]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines - Ultimate.rar&quot; file to a directory of your choice and then Navigate to the extracted directory (by default this is the &quot;Vampire The Masquerade&quot; directory). Double-click on the &quot;Vampire_Masquerade_Shortcuts.exe&quot; program. This program is not necessary as it only installs shortcuts (makes no changes to the game files which are already updated, modded, and cracked).\n\n(2.) Click through the installation instructions. Make certain that you install \nthe shortcut program to the &quot;Vampire The Masquerade&quot; directory.\n\n(4.) Open the desired shortcut (which by default is) located on your desktop to \nstart the game.\n\nShortcut Information:\n\n&quot;Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines&quot;                  - Single player game play\n\nNote: The official manual, soundtrack, and game covers are included in the &quot;..Vampire The MasqueradeExtras&quot; directory. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and roms in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like this one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nHalf Life Decay Co-op - The Decay Team\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nWe are currently waiting for the Decay Team to release their Beta port (long \noverdue). Once they do, the game will be cracked (if necessary) and released A.S.A.P.\n\nFarCry Co-op - BHD UPDATE*\n\nGame  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete - Loads of Fun\n\nThis update will include the Black Hawk Down Assault Co-op mini mod made for FarCry. It will be released when time can be found for basic testing and the writing of a noob-friendly NFO.\n\nQuake 4 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nAs many of you know opencoop recently released a tech demo of their next project Quake 4 Co-op which allows you to traverse most of the levels, with large amounts of lag, glitches, and crashes. Once they have a clean version working, this Crack-Mod will be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their work there is no release date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Recent Releases\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFarCry Co-op - Assault/Campaign Co-op   |Quake II Ultimate Co-op - COOP or DIE\t\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete \nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete \nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete \nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete \nURL   -\thttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n3791203\t \t\t\t\t|3792230/Quake_II_Ultimate_COOP_or_DIE_\n\nHalf Life Opposing Force - Hlcoop Clan \t|Sonic Comics Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Lib   - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|3933117/Sonic_Comics_Collection\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|\n3795267/Half-Life_Opposing_Force_\t|\nUltimate_Co-op  \t\t\t|\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop FINAL* |Half-Life Ultimate Co-op - Sven FINAL* \n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4218|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/42\n464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)\t|36344/Half-Life_Ultimate__Co-op_%5BInc\n\t\t\t\t        |ludes_Blue_Shift__amp__Opposing_Force%\n\t\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t    Known Issues\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1.)
