It applies the mathematics of Cartesian and general tensors to physical field theories and demonstrates them chiefly in terms of the theory of fluid mechanics. Numerous exercises appear throughout the text. 1962 edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d79e3daec0df2ac470fae5241e15b55742851ca","amp;dn":"Vectors%2C+Tensors+and+the+Basic+Equations+of+Fluid+Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d79e3daec0df2ac470fae5241e15b55742851ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,121,227,218,236,13,242,172,71,15,174,82,65,225,91,85,116,40,81,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
