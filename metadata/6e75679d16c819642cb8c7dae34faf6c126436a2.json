This installment kicks off with an overview of the SketchUp interface and workflow, and dives into a typical residential building project, taking students from creating the site plan to building the walls, floor, and roof of a house. Series author Paul J. Smith also shows how to add detail elements like stairs and ceiling trim, and make models more realistic with materials. Plus, learn how to take advantage of the organizational features that make drafting in SketchUp so much easierÃ¢â‚¬â€but that most designers never think to use.\nTopics include:\n\n    Installing SketchUp plugins\n    Moving the model around\n    Creating sweeps and revolves\n    Importing a CAD site plan\n    Defining the site boundary\n    Building a massing model\n    Adding walls, doors, and windows\n    Adding the roof\n    Creating stairs with a handrail\n    Adding texture to your SketchUp models","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e75679d16c819642cb8c7dae34faf6c126436a2","amp;dn":"Lynda-+SketchUp+for+Architecture%3A+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e75679d16c819642cb8c7dae34faf6c126436a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,117,103,157,22,200,25,100,44,184,199,218,227,79,175,108,18,100,54,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
