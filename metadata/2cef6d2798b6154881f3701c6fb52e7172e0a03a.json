Originally the stories were dark and complex enough to fall under the &quot;Mature Audiences/Vertigo&quot; banner; after Grell left, DC re-integrated Green Arrow into the mainstream community proper. This volume also features work by Kelley Puckett, Jim Aparo and Chuck Dixon, as well as the introduction of Connor Hawke as the new Emerald Archer toward the latter part of the series. The first 6 issues are in Digital form courtesy of Empire; there are also HD copies by Son of Ultron but I chose the normal ones for this torrent so as not to excessively bloat the size. The remaining issues are all older scans mixed with some DCP stuff here and there; not the greatest but that is all that is out there at the moment. I have added all the Annuals during this run and the special zero and one million issues. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cef6d2798b6154881f3701c6fb52e7172e0a03a","amp;dn":"Green+Arrow+v2+000-137%2C+1000000+%2B+Ann+01-07+%281988-1998%7CD%2BS%7CE%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cef6d2798b6154881f3701c6fb52e7172e0a03a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,239,109,39,152,182,21,72,129,243,112,28,111,181,46,113,114,224,160,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
