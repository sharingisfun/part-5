Their only discontent is Noriko's lack of a husband. Society is changing: she works, she has women friends who tease and argue, her brother sees her independence as impudence, she sees it as normal. When her boss suggests that she marry a 40-year-old bachelor who is his friend, all the members of her family press her to accept. Without seeking their advice, and to their chagrin, Noriko determines her own course of action. \n\nRip Specs\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Early.Summer.1951.720p.BluRay.x264-CiNEFiLE.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 4.37 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n   Video #1\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Bit rate : 4 660 Kbps\n      Width : 960 pixels\n      Height : 720 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n   Audio #2\n      Codec ID : A_AC3\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 256 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Language : Japanese\n   Text #3\n      Codec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text\n      Title : russian\n      Language : Russian\n   Text #4\n      Codec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text\n      Title : eng\n      Language : English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043313/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043313/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, Russian (in mkv), French, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish (srt)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da57de9036fef574d1c04db2e34d7588e0bb56b9","amp;dn":"Early.Summer.1951.720p.BluRay.x264-CiNEFiLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da57de9036fef574d1c04db2e34d7588e0bb56b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,87,222,144,54,254,245,116,209,192,77,178,227,77,117,136,224,187,86,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
