Around 88,000 refugee children are now stranded in Europe. Many have faced violence and police brutality, and hundreds have been imprisoned in detention centres and police cells. Alone and afraid, the children are vulnerable to trafficking gangs and sexual exploitation. Governments have moved many of them into state-run camps and closed the doors to journalists. This film meets seven children who have lost parents on the way to Europe, including 12-year-old Nagham and her 13-year-old brother Mohamed, orphans from the Syrian city of Aleppo. Having fled a government-run camp after violence erupted, they now live a small tent in a derelict petrol station in northern Greece. Elsewhere, the programme follows the story of a 15-year-old Syrian boy who is imprisoned with adults in Greece and who says that he has been denied medical care for shotgun wounds.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/12/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/49/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/49/The-Forgotten-Children-Screen8.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2741Kbps)\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 46 mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 952 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Subtitles: Merged\n\nLinks\n------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95bc3a3ca37296bb32857815e29fb33be670918b","amp;dn":"ITV+The+Forgotten+Children+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95bc3a3ca37296bb32857815e29fb33be670918b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,188,58,60,163,114,150,187,50,133,120,21,226,159,179,59,230,112,145,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
