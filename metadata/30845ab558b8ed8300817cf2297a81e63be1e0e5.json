Russian troop positions. Aleksandra Nikolaevna is a grand-mother who has come to see her grandson, one of the best officers in his unit. She will spend a few days here, and will discover a new world. In this male world there are no women, no warmth or comfort. Daily life is meagre, people are shy of their feelings here. Or maybe there simply isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t time or energy for feelings. Every day and every hour questions of life and death are decided here. And yet it is still a world populated by people. \n\n\t\nFile Name ...............................: Aleksandr Sokurov-Aleksandra (2007).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) .................: 1,281,378,304\nRuntime ..................................: 1:31:02\n\nVideo Codec ..........................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size .............................: 672 x 384 (AR: 16x9)\nFPS ........................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ..........................: 1419 Kb/s\nBits per Pixel ..........................: 0.220 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.....: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nNo. of audio streams .............: 1 (in Russian with English subs)\nAudio Codec ..........................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...........................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ..........................: 448 Kb/s tot, 6 chnls (3/2.1), CBR \n\n********************************************************************************\n    \nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
