Driving Collin Sutherland, the world's most fastidious vampire from Washington to Kentucky, so he can deliver a mysterious black case to Council official Ophelia Lambert.\n\nCollin, a paranoid, aristocratic vampire with a debilitating fear of flying, refuses to let the case out of his sight. Miranda needs this time on the road to decide whether to permanently cut her ties with the fiance that had an &quot;emotional affair&quot; with a childhood pal, but CollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s neatnik tendencies are driving her around the bend. The man acts as if leaving a fast food wrapped on the passenger seat is reason for a full-on CDC de-contamination scrub-down of the car. All she can do is promise to stop intentionally doing the things that make his stiff upper lip twitch with irritation.\n\nAs more and more mishaps occur on the road trip from hell, Miranda and Collin work together to meet his delivery deadline. Hotel rooms are destroyed. Beloved cars are defiled. And somewhere along the line, client-driver hostilities become snarky flirtation.\n\nWill Collin and Miranda make it to the Hollow in one piece? And if they do, will Miranda leave old, safe relationships behind for something new and well, just plain weird?\n\nThe Care and Feeding of Stray Vampires, Book 2: \nIris Scanlon, Half-Moon HollowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only daytime vampire concierge, knows more about the undead than sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like. Running all their daylight errandsÃ¢â‚¬â€from letting in the plumber to picking up some chilled O negÃ¢â‚¬â€gives her a look at the not-so-glamorous side of vampire life. Her rules are strict; relationships with vamps are strictly business, not friendshipÃ¢â‚¬â€and certainly not anything else. But then she finds her newest client, Cal, poisoned on his kitchen floor, and only Iris can help.\n\nCal - who would be devastatingly sexy, if Iris allowed herself to think that way - offers Iris a hefty fee for hiding him at her place until he figures out who wants him permanently dead. Even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imperious, unfriendly and doesn't seem to understand the difference between &quot;employee&quot; and &quot;servant,&quot; Iris agrees, and finds herself breaking more and more of her own rules to help him - particularly those concerning nudity.\n\nTurns out what her quiet little life needed was some intrigue &amp; romanceÃ¢â‚¬â€in the form of her very own stray vampire.\n\nUndead Sublet, Book 2.5 (An excerpt from The Undead in My Bed)\n\nExecutive chef Tess Maitland is banned from her five-star kitchen in Chicago to recover from Ã¢â‚¬Å“exhaustion.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Choosing a random rental house in Half-Moon Hollow to spend time in, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unaware that the house comes with a strange man. Even though Sam MasdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-wife has rented the house out from under him, the divorce settlement allows him access to it for another ninety days. With Tess unable to go anywhere else, and Sam unwilling, a war of epic proportions is declaredÃ¢â‚¬â€and romantic sparks and heavy pots fly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0402e2756bea265175df3f05f008abd8c52edf82","amp;dn":"Half+Moon+Hollow+0.5%2C+1%2C+1.5+by+Molly+Harper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0402e2756bea265175df3f05f008abd8c52edf82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,2,226,117,107,234,38,81,117,223,63,5,240,8,171,216,197,46,223,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
