As the film opens Ahmed (Ahmed Ahmed Poor), a grade schooler, watches as his teacher (Kheda Barech Defai) berates a fellow student, Mohammed (Babek Ahmed Poor), for repeatedly failing to use his notebook for his homework , threatening expulsion on the next offense. When Ahmed returns home, he realizes he's accidentally taken Mohammed's notebook. Against his mother's orders, he sets out in search Mohammed's house, encountering false leads, dead ends, and distractions as he attempts to enlist adults in his search.\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Khane-ye doust kodjast.1987.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 590 Kbps\nLength            : 1.44 GiB for 1h 19mn 29s 920ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 200 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 460 (1.670) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fa\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093342/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093342/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Farsi (Persian)\nSubtitles: French, English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5235125c4def1f832aa7f08f6c4ea3600afb7f95","amp;dn":"Khane-ye+doust+kodjast+AKA+Where+is+the+Friend%27s+Home+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5235125c4def1f832aa7f08f6c4ea3600afb7f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,53,18,92,77,239,31,131,42,167,240,143,108,78,163,96,10,251,127,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
