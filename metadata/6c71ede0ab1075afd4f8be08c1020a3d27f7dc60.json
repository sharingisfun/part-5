Ben Cotton (&quot;Hellcats&quot;) also stars in the film. Hallmark Channel's &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot; is the biggest holiday destination on television, premiering more original holiday programs than any other network. \n\nChicago native Emily Jones (Reeser) loves her city, and has dedicated her career to coordinating its beloved Thanksgiving Day parade every year. This year, Emily is hoping for a memorable holiday and anticipating a long-awaited proposal from her long-distance boyfriend Brian (Cotton). Then, the parade director hires a wealthy development consultant, Henry Williams (Cupo), to analyze the finances of the parade and increase profits. Immediately writing Henry off as a privileged playboy, Emily worries he will ruin the joyful spirit of the parade, not knowing how much it means to the city like she does. As the two are forced to work together to pull off a successful production, Emily is determined to show Henry she's in charge. But when Emily suffers a sudden setback, she starts to rely on Henry to help her through it, and suddenly realizes she might be falling for him. As Thanksgiving draws nearer, can Emily confess her true feelings and end the feud, while still putting on the parade of her dreams? \n\n\nCast:\n\nAntonio Cupo ... Henry Williams\nAutumn Reeser ...
