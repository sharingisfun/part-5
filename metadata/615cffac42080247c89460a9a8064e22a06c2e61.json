Equally informed by Cuban and indigenous African musics, not to mention hybrids like Congolese rumba and Senegal's own pop strain mbalax, the disc found them picking up where they left off. \n\nSix years later, Made in Dakar continues the voyage with still more seamless style blending.\n\nIt unveils a string of beautifully crafted new songs together with reworked gems from their 20 album discography. Revisiting tunes from nights spent in steamyDakar dance clubs, Baobab's merry but unhurried music braids high life with Cuban- flecked rumba (&quot;Aline&quot;) and American soul jazz (&quot;Colette&quot;), while updating the griot of &quot;NdÃƒÂ©leng NdÃƒÂ©leng&quot; with barbed guitar. Whether the songs are rendered in Malinke, Wolof, Portuguese, or French, Baobab perpetually play songs of love for their wives (&quot;Nijaay&quot;), their country (&quot;Cabral&quot;), and beyond words, music itself. \n \nIt's dance music, pure and simple, made for others to have a good time, easily appreciated on the basis of its musicianship alone (Attisso is particularly inspired throughout) but becoming more impressive the deeper you dig into what's actually being done.\n\n\nCD / 2007 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
