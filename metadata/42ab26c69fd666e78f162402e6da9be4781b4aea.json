Great Britain's Lewis Hamilton was the master of Montreal in last year's race, winning a thrilling race-long five-car battle. Hamilton took the chequered flag ahead of his McLaren team-mate Jenson Button, with Fernando Alonso not far behind in third. The Red Bull pair of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber were down in fourth and fifth, but this year Vettel has been the man to beat following his stunning start to the season. The current world champion, though, has yet to taste victory on a track where his German compatriot Michael Schumacher won a record seven times. With commentary from Martin Brundle and David Coulthard.\n\n\n\nPart1: Intro\nPart2: Race up to lap25 when play suspended\nPart3:Waffle Part1\nPart4:Waffle Part2\nPart5: Tyre/Engine Warmup\nPart6: Race Part 2\n\nPart2 &amp; 6 have R5 commentary as well as BBC1 - R5 went to other programming during parts 3,4,5\n\n\n1080 will go up tomorrow - im not a massochist\n\nGeneral : C:\\Torrents\\2011-06-12_Formula 1 - 2011 - Canada Grand Prix.720.thebox.hannibal\\2011-06-12_Formula 1 - 2011 - Canada Grand Prix.720.pt6.thebox.hannibal.mkv\nFormat : Matroska at 3 890 Kbps\nLength : 2 GiB for 1h 27mn 16s 480ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 3 236 Kbps\nAspect : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en\n\nAudio #1 : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42ab26c69fd666e78f162402e6da9be4781b4aea","amp;dn":"2011-06-12_Formula+1+-+2011+-+Canada+Grand+Prix.720.thebox.hanni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42ab26c69fd666e78f162402e6da9be4781b4aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,171,38,198,159,214,102,231,143,22,36,2,230,218,155,228,120,27,74,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
