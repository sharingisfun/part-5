After releasing two albums with 4AD, he left the label and formed a backing band, Frank Black and the Catholics. He reformed the Pixies in 2004 and continues to release solo records and tour as a solo artist,[4] having re-adopted his current stage name in 2007.\n\nHis vocal style has varied from a screaming, yowling delivery as lead vocalist of the Pixies to a more measured and melodical style in his solo career.[5] His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and Biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture.[6] His use of atypical meter signatures, loud-quiet dynamics and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording in his career as a solo artist give him a distinct style within alternative rock.[7]\n\nAs frontman of the Pixies, his songs (such as &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; and &quot;Debaser&quot;) received praise and citations from contemporaries, including Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. Cobain once said that &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was his attempt at trying to &quot;rip off the Pixies&quot;.[8] However, in his solo work and records with the Catholics, he received fewer popular and critical accolades. \n\n\n\n\nFrank Black 1993\n\nFrank Black is the first solo album from the American alternative rock musician Frank Black. The album was recorded in 1992 and released on 9 March 1993 via 4AD, after the breakup of the Pixies. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' last album Trompe le Monde. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other eclectic subjects, such as in &quot;I Heard Ramona Sing&quot;, a song about the Ramones, which also appears on the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Soundtrack. Two singles from the album - &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;Hang on to Your Ego&quot; - were released in 1993. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; is featured on the game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Los Angeles&quot; - 4:08\n2.\t&quot;I Heard Ramona Sing&quot; - 3:40\n3.\t&quot;Hang On to Your Ego&quot; - 3:24\n4.\t&quot;Fu Manchu&quot; - 3:02\n5.\t&quot;Places Named After Numbers&quot; - 2:52\n6.\t&quot;Czar&quot; - 2:42\n7.\t&quot;Old Black Dawning&quot; - 2:02\n8.\t&quot;Ten Percenter&quot; - 3:28\n9.\t&quot;Brackish Boy&quot; - 1:35\n10.\t&quot;Two Spaces&quot; - 2:25\n11.\t&quot;Tossed&quot; (Instrumental Version) - 4:09\n12.\t&quot;Parry the Wind High, Low&quot; - 4:32\n13.\t&quot;Adda Lee&quot; - 2:00\n14.\t&quot;Every Time I Go Around Here&quot; - 3:31\n15.\t&quot;Don't Ya Rile 'Em&quot; - 2:52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeenager Of The Year 1994\n\nReleased in 1994, Teenager of the Year was Frank BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second solo album, produced by Eric Drew Feldman. Long considered a testament to Frank Black's amazing (and prolific) songwriting skills as well as his tremendous virtue as a performer, Teenager also features great work by several excellent backing musicians including Pixies guitarist Joey Santiago and guitarist Lyle Workman. Notable songs include &quot;(I Want to Live on an) Abstract Plain&quot; and &quot;Headache&quot;. The record is widely praised by both critics and fans as his strongest post-Pixies moment.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Whatever Happened to Pong?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n2.\t&quot;Thalassocracy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:33\n3.\t&quot;(I Want to Live on an) Abstract Plain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n4.\t&quot;Calistan&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n5.\t&quot;The Vanishing Spies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n6.\t&quot;Speedy Marie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n7.\t&quot;Headache&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n8.\t&quot;Sir Rockaby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:54\n9.\t&quot;Freedom Rock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n10.\t&quot;Two Reelers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n11.\t&quot;Fiddle Riddle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n12.\t&quot;OlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Mulholland&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n13.\t&quot;Fazer Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n14.\t&quot;I Could Stay Here Forever&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27\n15.\t&quot;The Hostess with the Mostest&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:56\n16.\t&quot;Superabound&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n17.\t&quot;Big Red&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n18.\t&quot;Space Is Gonna Do Me Good&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:22\n19.\t&quot;White Noise Maker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n20.\t&quot;Pure Denizen of the Citizens Band&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20\n21.\t&quot;Bad, Wicked World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:57\n22.\t&quot;Pie in the Sky&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:13\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cult Of Ray 1996\n\nThe Cult of Ray is the third Frank Black solo album. The title refers to Ray Bradbury. The core musicians employed on this album would eventually be dubbed The Catholics, and would continue as Black's backing group for the following seven years (albeit with a changed line up). The album's final song is a tribute to Shazeb Andleeb, who was beaten to death at Narbonne High School in Harbor City, California in 1995.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Marsist&quot; - 4:11\n2.\t&quot;Men in Black *&quot; - 3:03\n3.\t&quot;Punk Rock City&quot; - 3:41\n4.\t&quot;You Ain't Me *&quot; - 2:43\n5.\t&quot;Jesus Was Right&quot; - 2:59\n6.\t&quot;I Don't Want to Hurt You (Every Single Time)&quot; - 3:06\n7.\t&quot;Mosh, Don't Pass the Guy&quot; - 3:01\n8.\t&quot;Kicked in the Taco&quot; - 2:27\n9.\t&quot;The Creature Crawling&quot; - 2:53\n10.\t&quot;The Adventure and the Resolution *&quot; - 3:02\n11.\t&quot;Dance War *&quot; - 2:08\n12.\t&quot;The Cult of Ray&quot; - 3:46\n13.\t&quot;The Last Stand of Shazeb Andleeb&quot; - 4:40\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Black &amp; The Catholics 1998\n\nFrank Black and the Catholics was the eponymous debut album from Frank Black and the Catholics. The backing group on this album performed on Black's previous album, The Cult of Ray, but the group name was first adopted on this release. The album was recorded live to two-track tape over the course of two days in 1997, but a protracted dispute with Black's label American Recordings [1], reportedly over the &quot;raw&quot; sound of the recordings [2], delayed its release for 18 months. The album was released in June 1998 in the MP3 format on GoodNoise.com (precursor to eMusic) and was the first album by a major artist to be commercially released on the Internet. The album was then released in the fall of 1998 by SpinART records in the US. During the interim, Lyle Workman left the group and was replaced by Rich Gilbert, and Black prepared the follow-up, &quot;Pistolero&quot;. The track listing is notable for having been sequenced in alphabetical order.\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;All My Ghosts&quot; - 3:32\n2.\t&quot;Back to Rome&quot; - 3:25\n3.\t&quot;Do You Feel Bad About It?&quot; - 2:07\n4.\t&quot;Dog Gone&quot; - 3:00\n5.\t&quot;I Gotta Move&quot; - 3:37\n6.\t&quot;I Need Peace&quot; - 5:12\n7.\t&quot;King &amp; Queen of Siam&quot; - 2:51\n8.\t&quot;Six-Sixty-Six&quot; (Larry Norman) - 3:03\n9.\t&quot;Solid Gold&quot; - 4:18\n10.\t&quot;Steak 'n' Sabre&quot; - 3:47\n11.\t&quot;Suffering&quot; - 2:58\n12.\t&quot;The Man Who Was Too Loud&quot; - 3:31\n\n\n\n\n\nPistolero  \n\nPistolero is the second album by Frank Black and the Catholics, produced by Nick Vincent and released via spinART Records on March 9, 1999.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Bad Harmony&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n2.\t&quot;I Switched You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n3.\t&quot;Western Star&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n4.\t&quot;Tiny Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n5.\t&quot;You're Such a Wire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:07\n6.\t&quot;I Love Your Brain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n7.\t&quot;Smoke Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n8.\t&quot;Billy Radcliffe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n9.\t&quot;So Hard to Make Things Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n10.\t&quot;85 Weeks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36\n11.\t&quot;I Think I'm Starting to Lose It&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:11\n12.\t&quot;I Want Rock &amp; Roll&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n13.\t&quot;Skeleton Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n14.\t&quot;So.

The album was generally met with favorable reviews. Though retaining the live-to-two-track method of recording of the previous two albums, this album found the band branching away from purely electric rock to incorporate acoustic guitar, pedal steel, and Rhodes Piano and Wurlitzer organ into the sonic template. The album was initially released by the What Are Records? label in 2001, and was reissued by SpinART in 2003.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Blast Off&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:13\n2.\t&quot;I've Seen Your Picture&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n3.\t&quot;St. Francis Dam Disaster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n4.\t&quot;Robert Onion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n5.\t&quot;Stupid Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31\n6.\t&quot;Bullet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n7.\t&quot;The Swimmer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n8.\t&quot;Hermaphroditos&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n9.\t&quot;I'll Be Blue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n10.\t&quot;Llano del Rio&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n11.\t&quot;If It Takes All Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n12.\t&quot;Dog in the Sand&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n\n\n\n\nBlack Letter Days 2002\n\n\nBlack Letter Days is the first of two albums by Frank Black and the Catholics simultaneously released in 2002 (along with Devil's Workshop). The title implies the opposite of the term &quot;Red Letter Days&quot; which are holidays ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a &quot;black letter day&quot; being all the ordinary days in a given month.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Black Rider&quot; - 2:37\n2.\t&quot;California Bound&quot; - 3:24\n3.\t&quot;Chip Away Boy&quot; - 2:57\n4.\t&quot;Cold Heart of Stone&quot; - 3:19\n5.\t&quot;Black Letter Day&quot; - 3:26\n6.\t&quot;Valentine and Garuda&quot; - 3:13\n7.\t&quot;How You Went So Far&quot; - 4:05\n8.\t&quot;End of Miles&quot; - 3:49\n9.\t&quot;1826&quot; - 6:40\n10.\t&quot;The Farewell Bend&quot; - 3:23\n11.\t&quot;Southbound Bevy&quot; - 3:07\n12.\t&quot;I Will Run After You&quot; - 3:58\n13.\t&quot;True Blue&quot; - 1:49\n14.\t&quot;Jane the Queen of Love&quot; - 5:10\n15.\t&quot;Jet Black River&quot; - 1:51\n16.\t&quot;21 Reasons&quot; - 5:40\n17.\t&quot;Whispering Weeds&quot; - 3:39\n18.\t&quot;The Black Rider&quot; - 3:09\n\n\n\n\nDevil's Workshop 2002\n\nDevil's Workshop is the second of a pair of albums by Frank Black and the Catholics to be simultaneously released on August 20, 2002 (along with Black Letter Days). 'His Kingly Cave' was originally recorded for an aborted album project in mid-2000 entitled Sunday Sunny Mill Valley Groove Day. &quot;Velvety&quot;'s music comes from an earlier Pixies b-side, appropriately named &quot;Velvety Instrumental Version&quot;. The track first received lyrics when it was revived for this album.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Velvety&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:28\n2.\t&quot;Out of State&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n3.\t&quot;His Kingly Cave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n4.\t&quot;San Antonio, TX&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n5.\t&quot;Bartholomew&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:26\n6.\t&quot;Modern Age&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n7.\t&quot;Are You Headed My Way?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:03\n8.\t&quot;Heloise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n9.\t&quot;The Scene&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n10.\t&quot;Whiskey in Your Shoes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n11.\t&quot;Fields of Marigold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n\n\n\n\nShow Me Your Tears 2003\n\n\nShow Me Your Tears is the final album to be released to date by Frank Black and the Catholics. The album employs a wide range of guests, including piano and an arrangement by maverick composer Van Dyke Parks on the final track. Within months of the album's release, it was announced that Black would be participating in a Pixies reunion, and since that time, the Catholics have effectively been defunct.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Nadine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n2.\t&quot;Everything Is New&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n3.\t&quot;My Favorite Kiss&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:06\n4.\t&quot;Jaina Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n5.\t&quot;New House of the Pope&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n6.\t&quot;Horrible Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n7.\t&quot;Massif Centrale&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n8.\t&quot;When Will Happiness Find Me Again?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:19\n9.\t&quot;Goodbye Lorraine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n10.\t&quot;This Old Heartache&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n11.\t&quot;The Snake&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:01\n12.\t&quot;Coastline&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:57\n13.\t&quot;Manitoba&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n\n\n\n\nFrank Black Francis 2004\n\n\nFrank Black Francis is a 2-CD set released in 2004 by Frank Black, roughly coinciding with the Pixies reunion tour. Disc 1 consists of a March 1987 solo acoustic demo tape recorded by engineer Gary Smith, just prior to the first Pixies recording session. Disc 2 is a contemporary recording of Frank Black reworking a number of Pixies songs with Keith MolinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and Andy Diagram, who are part of David Thomas and Two Pale Boys.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Holiday Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:54\n2.\t&quot;I'm Amazed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:25\n3.\t&quot;Rock a My Soul&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:50\n4.\t&quot;Isla de Encanta&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:39\n5.\t&quot;Caribou&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n6.\t&quot;Broken Face&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:21\n7.\t&quot;Build High&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:26\n8.\t&quot;Nimrod's Son&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:08\n9.\t&quot;Ed Is Dead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n10.\t&quot;Subbacultcha&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n11.\t&quot;Boom Chickaboom&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33\n12.\t&quot;I've Been Tired&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n13.\t&quot;Break My Body&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55\n14.\t&quot;Oh My Golly!&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:59\n15.\t&quot;Vamos&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Caribou&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n2.\t&quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n3.\t&quot;Cactus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n4.\t&quot;Nimrod's Son&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n5.\t&quot;Levitate Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:01\n6.\t&quot;Wave of Mutilation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:25\n7.\t&quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n8.\t&quot;Velouria&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n9.\t&quot;The Holiday Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:21\n10.\t&quot;Into the White&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n11.\t&quot;Is She Weird?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n12.\t&quot;Subbacultcha&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n13.\t&quot;Planet of Sound&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 14:56\n\n\n\n\nHoneycomb 2005\n\n\nHoneycomb is the tenth studio album by American alternative rock musician Frank Black, released in July 2005 on Back Porch Records. His first original solo work since 1996's The Cult of Ray, Honeycomb was recorded in Nashville, and features notable local session musicians, such as Steve Cropper and ex-Presley guitarist Reggie Young. Frank Black had discussed making a Black on Blonde record for about ten years with producer Jon Tiven, where he would travel to Nashville (like Dylan with Blonde on Blonde) and record with local musicians. In 2005, Black eventually found the time to record such an album. He went to Nashville and met with musicians whom Tiven had selected for the record.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Selkie Bride&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n2.\t&quot;I Burn Today&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n3.\t&quot;Lone Child&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n4.\t&quot;Another Velvet Nightmare&quot; (Black, Reid Paley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n5.\t&quot;Dark End of the Street&quot; (Dan Penn, Chips Moman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n6.\t&quot;Go Find Your Saint&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n7.\t&quot;Song of the Shrimp&quot; (Roy C.

The album was released on 11 September 2007 in the United States and Europe. The project was revealed via several cryptic posts by Black on his unofficial website,[12], which were confirmed as accurate when the album leaked to file-sharing services earlier in the year. All of the songs on the album reference Dutch musician and artist Herman Brood, some directly and some indirectly. In addition, &quot;You Can't Break a Heart and Have It&quot; is a Brood cover. The title of the album, Bluefinger, is also a direct reference to the birthplace of Brood, who was born in the Dutch city of Zwolle, of which the citizens are colloquially known as Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). The song &quot;Threshold Apprehension&quot; was #90 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.[13]\n\n&quot;You Can't Break a Heart and Have It&quot; was included in the soundtrack for Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\n\nIn 2010, Bluefinger was adapted into a play/rock opera, in collaboration with Jason Nodler, for Houston's acclaimed Catastrophic Theatre\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Captain Pasty&quot; - 2:23\n2.\t&quot;Threshold Apprehension&quot; - 5:12\n3.\t&quot;Test Pilot Blues&quot; - 2:55\n4.\t&quot;Lolita&quot; - 2:59\n5.\t&quot;Tight Black Rubber&quot; - 4:17\n6.\t&quot;Angels Come to Comfort You&quot; - 4:25\n7.\t&quot;Your Mouth Into Mine&quot; - 3:41\n8.\t&quot;Discotheque 36&quot; - 4:40\n9.\t&quot;You Can't Break a Heart and Have It&quot; (Herman Brood) - 2:36\n10.\t&quot;She Took All the Money&quot; - 2:30\n11.\t&quot;Bluefinger&quot; - 3:29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSvn Fngrs  2008\n\nSvn Fngrs is a mini-album by Black Francis (aka Frank Black), released on March 3, 2008[1]. The album's title is a reference to the Irish mythological hero CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºchulainn, who was said to have seven fingers and seven toes. The songs &quot;Seven Fingers&quot; and &quot;When They Come to Murder Me&quot; also feature lyrics written from CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºchulainn's point of view.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Seus&quot; - 3:42\n2.\t&quot;Garbage Heap&quot; - 2:50\n3.\t&quot;Half Man&quot; - 2:33\n4.\t&quot;I Sent Away&quot; - 2:03\n5.\t&quot;Seven Fingers&quot; - 1:46\n6.\t&quot;The Tale of Lonesome Fetter&quot; - 3:56\n7.\t&quot;When They Come to Murder Me&quot; - 3:24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Golem 2010 (Rock Songs Version)\n\n\nThe Golem is a soundtrack written and performed by Black Francis at the 2008 San Francisco International Film Festival for the 1920 film The Golem: How He Came into the World. The soundtrack was released in 2010 as a 5-disc set. Only 500 copies were made, and was released exclusively for purchase from Blackfrancis.net. The set included 2 CDs containing the studio recordings, 2 CDs containing the original 2008 live performance at San Francisco International Film Festival, a DVD of The Golem: How He Came into the World with the soundtrack synced to the film, and a book containing chord charts by Nick Vicent and lyrics by Black Francis for The Golem. Each of the 500 copies were signed by Black Francis, and each were wrapped in brown paper and sealed with a &quot;Black Francis&quot; marked wax stamp. A &quot;rock songs&quot; version, according to Francis, is in the works for a more commercial release. However, this version is said to contain only the substantial songs, leaving out the reprises and themes that were included with the disc set. No additional information has been given about the release date for this version.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\tYou're Gonna Pay (Preview)\n2.\tLittle Stars Theme\n3.\tBad News\n4.\tAstaroth\n5.\tThe Maharal\n6.\tMiriam and Florian\n7.\tStars Theme\n8.\tMiriam and Florian Theme (Version 1)\n9.\tStars\n10.\tThe Conjuring\n11.\tAstaroth (Reprise)\n12.\tMakanujo (Preview)\n13.\tThe Word\n14.\tThe Obedient Servant\n15.\tGolem's Theme (Version 1)\n16.\tMiriam and Florian Theme (Version 2)\n17.\tMiriam and Florian Theme (Version 3)\n18.\tThe Maharal (Reprise)\n19.\tGolem's Theme (Version 2)\n20.\tThe Flower Song (Preview)\n21.\tGolem's Theme (Version 3)\n22.\tMiriam and Florian Theme (Version 4)\n23.\tMakanujo\n24.\tGolem's Theme (Version 4)\n25.\tMeet Me At The Ghetto Gates\n26.\tCustom All The Way\n27.\tYou're Gonna Pay\n28.\tThe Word (Reprise)\n29.\t(Oh How I Wish I Could) Stay\n30.\tMakanujo (Reprise)\n31.\t(Oh How I Wish I Could) Stay (Reprise)\n32.\tThe Flower Song\n33.\tGolem's Theme (Version 5)\n34.\tThe Obedient Servant (Reprise)\n\n\n\n\n\nNon Stop Erotik 2010\n\n\nNonStopErotik is a studio album by Black Francis released on March 30, 2010, in the US, and April 6 elsewhere.[1] A film by Judy Jacob coincided with the album's release.
