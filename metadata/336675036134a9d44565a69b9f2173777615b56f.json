Will you succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Or return home triumphant with a hold full of precious loot? Events can turn out differently every game - sometimes, even if you make the same choices. Will you lose your sweetheart to a curse? Redeem, betray or consume the Genial Magician? Sell your soul to the Wistful Deviless or spurn her advances? Is the Dawn Machine your salvation, or your doom?\nYou are the captain. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your call.\n\n\n== Features\n- A deep, compelling world packed with 200,000+ words of stories and secrets.\n- Light and dark. Stray too far from the gas-lamps of civilisation and your crew will grow fearful and eventually lose their sanity. But there is treasure out there in the darknessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n- Beautiful, hand drawn art - castles of sparkling ice, prisons perched on lily pads, fog-shrouded lighthouses and the DAWN MACHINE. \n- Upgrade your steamship with powerful engines, flensing cannons, and pneumatic torpedo guns. Or just buy a bigger, better ship.\n- Hire unique officers like the Haunted Doctor and the Irrepressible Cannoneer. Each has a story to tell, if you can draw it out of them.\n- Choose from a menagerie of shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mascots: the Comatose Ferret, the Wretched Mog, the Elegiac Cockatoo, and more!\n- Trade silk and souls, mushroom wine, and hallucinogenic honey.\n\n\n== Version: \nSoundtrack in MP3 from April 23, 2015\n\n\n== Instructions:\nListen - Enjoy - Seed - give me what I need\nSpeed! Yeah!\n\n\n\n If you enjoyed the game then share with others by seeding!\n========= Support game development and buy the game!\n\nGame made by Failbetter Games \nwww.failbettergames.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:336675036134a9d44565a69b9f2173777615b56f","amp;dn":"Sunless+Sea+Soundtrack+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"336675036134a9d44565a69b9f2173777615b56f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,102,117,3,97,52,169,212,69,101,166,155,159,33,115,119,118,21,181,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
