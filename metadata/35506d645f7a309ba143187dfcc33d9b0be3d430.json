Is there any other fictional character as instantly recognisable as the great detective? From his deerstalker and pipe to his science of deduction, Holmes is iconic, and heâ€™s synonymous with crime fiction. In this book, you will discover what it was that started Sherlock Holmesâ€™ world domination, and meet the man eclipsed by his creationâ€™s fame. Find out how Holmesâ€™ life mirrored that of Arthur Conan Doyle, and how the famous author went from a man of science, to a believer in fairies and seances. Learn more about the new trend of crime fiction kickstarted by the great detective, as well as the many plays, shows and films he inspired. Finally, delve into the original stories from the Return of Sherlock Holmes, supported by lavish maps, letters and clippings from Dr Watsonâ€™s very own case notes!\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n08 The Great Detective\r\nMeet Sherlock Holmes.\r\nPleasure, Iâ€™m sure.\r\n14 The Life of Sherlock Holmes\r\nWhat made Holmes great?\r\n44 The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle\r\nInside the mind of Conan Doyle\r\n80 The Holmes Records\r\nHow many mysteries did he solve?\r\n108 Crime Fiction\r\nDiscover the icons of crime\r\n130 The Immortal Reputation\r\nThe lasting legacy of Holmes\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/tfnct1ubp/The_Sherlock_Holmes_Book_2016.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35506d645f7a309ba143187dfcc33d9b0be3d430","amp;dn":"The+Sherlock+Holmes+Book+2016+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35506d645f7a309ba143187dfcc33d9b0be3d430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,80,109,100,95,122,48,155,161,67,24,125,252,195,61,155,11,227,212,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
