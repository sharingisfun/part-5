Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics.\n\nRussell guides the reader through his famous distinction between Ã¢â‚¬Å“knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by descriptionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, RenÃƒÂ© Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel and others, to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike.
