Beyond the stage of genre-confining mediocrity, new hybrid forms are emerging, fusing prog rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technicality and musicianship with the ear-catching infectiousness of pop and jazz fusion.\n\nNewest on the scene are the wunderkinds that make up Polyphia. All aged 20-21, the Texan instrumental outfit are ready to show the world their debut full-length, Muse. Equally inspired by guitar wizards Guthrie Govan and Rick Graham, and the pop sensibility of the R&amp;B/rap world, Muse is a 44 minute ride full of groove, ear-teasing riffs and melodies and blindsiding musical brilliance. Who needs vocals?\n\nPolyphia are a band fast on the rise. Backed by an impressive fanbase who crowdfunded the album, the group are set to undertake their first two tours in the USA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ first with prog metal stars Monuments and latterly with Intervals and The Contortionist.\n\nFeaturing members of Intervals, Chelsea Grin, CHON and more, Muse was produced by Nick Sampson (Born of Osiris, I am Abomination, In Fear and Faith) at 37 studios.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.87 \n2.Sweet Tea (feat.
