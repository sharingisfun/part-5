You're sprinting down a corridor filled with monsters, chests, and traps. You have to bypass these by matching bundles of symbols on the grid that takes up the bottom of the screen.\nKeys unlock chests, swords and staves deal damage to your foes. Matching shields gives you some protection, smashing crates might give you a special item to use, and power and brain tiles are used to gain currency.\nThe level is always moving though, so the longer you spend trying to match enough keys to unlock that crate, the more likely you are to fail. Bad guys will bash you backwards as well, sending you ever closer to the left edge of the screen and the end of your run.\nEvery run sees you trying to complete one or two quests. These range from killing a specific monster to matching a set number of tiles of the same kind. Each chapter of the game has a handful of these, and when you've completed them you and your crew move on to the next.\nCompleting quests adds new rooms and their inhabitants to your ship. You'll get a blacksmith who can strengthen your swords, a trainer who lets you use captured monsters to boost your skills, and a weird blue orb that lets you sell your treasures.&quot; -- pocketgamer\n\n\n== Features:\nBuild A Boat \nTravel the world in your boat, from the top of the Mage Tower to the bottom of Hell \n\nGather Your Crew \nRecruit a crew to live on your boat and offer their services \n\nFrantic Matching \nMatch As Fast As You Can to Keep On Running \n\nCapture Monsters \nTurn Monsters to your cause to get bonuses and have them aid your in battle \n\nCast Spells \nUse magic to aid your quests, and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to visit your onboard Arcanery to upgrade them \n\nRandom Dungeons \nWith procedural dungeons and random Dungeon Modifiers, ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never the same experience twice \n\nBuild Your Board \nUpgrade your tiles, Quaff Potions and Pray for Modifiers to whatever fits your play style best\n\nSpeedrun \nHow Fast Can You Build Your Boat?\n\n\n\n== Version:\nYou Must Build A Boat v1.0.1640, from June 10, 2015 \nClean Steam files\n\n\n== Instructions:\nRun YMBAB.exe\nPlay - Enjoy - Seed!\nGive me what I need - speed - Yeah!\n\n\n== System Requirements:\nCPU: Core2Duo \nOS: Windows XP / 7 (not sure about Windows 8)\nGPU: OpenGL 2.0 compatible video card with 256 MB shared or dedicated RAM (ATI or NVIDIA) \nHDD: 150 MB available space\nRAM: 1 GB\n\n\n \n          If you enjoyed the game then share with others by seeding!\n                       Remember to support quality games.\n\n\nGame made by \nEightyEight Games LTD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:768f521cb496693f236b4b255abb3e5d5c8f46a9","amp;dn":"You+Must+Build+A+Boat+%28v1.0.1640%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"768f521cb496693f236b4b255abb3e5d5c8f46a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,143,82,28,180,150,105,63,35,107,75,37,90,187,62,93,92,143,70,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
