The albums that they recorded with a big band (Talk That Talk), latin percussion, organ and flute (Chile Con Soul) and in collaboration with Les McCann (Jazz Waltz) are of a very different nature and not included here. Nor is the R &amp; B single (Bunny Ride b/w Sweetie Lester) which they recorded for the label in 1962 as The Night Hawks, which sounds nothing like the Jazz Crusaders.\nWe have chosen to concentrate on their studio work because their live albums (Festival Album and the four done live at The Lighthouse) are or will soon be available on individual Pacific Jazz CDs.\nDick Bock's notorious and liberal practice of editing tape is obvious in many spots throughout this set, but full versions of the edited tunes do not exist. Some tape damage has occurred over the years, which causes things like the flutter at the end of the melody on the master take of New Time Shuffle, and every precaution has been taken to repair or improve such problems.\n-Michael Cuscuna ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b35af7cc929b2e5f9cbec0e75cd959b5d45b003","amp;dn":"Jazz+Crusaders+-+The+Pacific+Jazz+Quintet+Studio+Sessions+-+6-CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b35af7cc929b2e5f9cbec0e75cd959b5d45b003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,53,175,124,201,41,178,229,249,203,236,14,117,205,149,155,93,69,176,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
