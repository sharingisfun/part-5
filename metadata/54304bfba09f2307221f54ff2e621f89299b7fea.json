But he wound up facing something far more terrible: the legacy of a vicious murder, the fate of a dying child, and dark truths about lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and what comes afterÃ¢â‚¬â€that would change his world forever.\n\nA riveting story about love and loss, about growing up and growing oldÃ¢â‚¬â€and about those who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get to do either because death comes for them before their timeÃ¢â‚¬â€JOYLAND is Stephen King at the peak of his storytelling powers. With all the emotional impact of King masterpieces such as The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption, JOYLAND is at once a mystery, a horror story, and a bittersweet coming-of-age novel, one that will leave even the most hard-boiled reader profoundly moved.\n\nepub.mobi and txt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54304bfba09f2307221f54ff2e621f89299b7fea","amp;dn":"Joyland+By+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54304bfba09f2307221f54ff2e621f89299b7fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,48,75,251,160,159,35,7,34,31,84,255,46,98,31,137,41,155,127,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
