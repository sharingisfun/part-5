Big jumps are key. Whooping and hollering is too. \n\nBut for those of you looking for something slighly more quantifiable, we have a quick rundown: \n\nUnique rider/bike physics model. Users control the throttle, brake, steering and gears on the bike, as well as the rider's center of gravity, which can be moved forward, backward or to either side. This results in superior control for sophisticated racers and more realistic gameplay for all users. In addition, users can actually control 16 different midair stunts and jumps. \n\nOutrageous Supercross racing. Motocross Madness offers a wide variety of racing and stunt environments, including indoors and outdoors stadiums, quarry and long distance Baja courses. \n\n3D-accelerated environments. Motocross Madness is built from the ground up to take full advantage of 3D-hardware acceleration. Motion-captured riders and beautifully-crafted environments makes players feel like they're in the action. \n\nTrack editor. Motocross Madness' easy-to-use track editor helps users build supercross tracks based on multiple templates supplied with the game. \n\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMultimedia PC with Pentium 133 MHz processor and 4MB 3-D card or Multimedia PC Pentium 166 MHz processor and 2MB 3-D card \nMicrosoftÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 95 or Windows 98 operating system \nRequires Microsoft DirectXÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 5.0 compatible 3-D accelerator card \n16 MB of RAM \n60 MB of available hard-disk space for minimum install; 180 MB of available hard-disk space for typical install (50 MB of available hard-disk space for swap file) \nQuad-speed or faster CD-ROM drive \nMicrosoft Mouse or compatible pointing device \nDirectX 5.0-compatible sound card \nSpeakers or headphones recommended \nDirectX 5.0-compatible joystick or gamepad recommended \n28.8 modem for head-to-head play \nNull modem cable, or ethernet card for network play \nInternet access for Internet play (connect time charges may apply) \n\n\nThe following hardware will be supported as well: \n\nMicrosoft Sidewinder Pro joystick and game pad \n3-axis joysticks \nThrottle sticks (default programming files included for CH and Thrust Master throttle sticks) \nGas/brake pedals \nVirtual I/O headset \nMicrosoft Force Feedback joystick\n\nSCREENS:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6666/dmp00010.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6666/dmp00010.jpg&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a234/normaldutch/dmp00123.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a234/normaldutch/dmp00123.jpg&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a234/normaldutch/dmp00017.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a234/normaldutch/dmp00017.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nINSTALL NOTES:\n\n1.
