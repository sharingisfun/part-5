To build this empire it resorted to every dirty trick and immoral means in the book: deceit, lies, assassinations, coups, installing cronies and puppet governments, and spreading drugs (opium) and prostitution to weaken its opponents. The English colonists were masters at creating divisions among their targeted native people, and building alliances with the rich and powerful against the masses, the weak and the poor. Even after their departure, they leave behind causes for continuous conflict and war (e.g. Palestine, Kashmir, Ireland, ..) Ironically, the U.S. - that was once a colony in the British empire - was one of the countries that suffered on the hands of the British imperial forces.\n\nWe have 29 titles in this upload:\n\n-  Aldrich - GCHQ; the Uncensored Story of Britain's Most Secret Intelligence Agency (2010)\n\n-  Anderson - Lawrence in Arabia; War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East (2013)\n\n-  Andrew &amp; Bushnell - The Queen's Daughters in India (1809)\n\n-  Bellington - Britain's War Against FDR in the East Asian Theater (EIR, 1999)\n\n-  Brendon - The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997 (2007)\n\n-  Byrd - Captives and Voyagers; Black Migrants Across the Eighteenth-Century British Atlantic World (2008)\n\n-  Chandra - IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Struggle for Independence, 1857-1947 (2012)\n\n-  Chatterjee - The Black Hole of Empire; History of a Global Practice of Power (2012)\n\n-  Darwin - The Empire Project; the Rise and Fall of the British World-System, 1830Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1970 (2009)\n\n-  Dope, Inc.; Britain's Opium War Against the U.S. (1978)\n\n-  Dumbrell - A Special Relationship; Anglo-American Relations in the Cold War and After, 2e (2006)\n\n-  Foreman - A World on Fire; Britain's Crucial Role in the American Civil War (2010)\n\n-  Gott - Britain's Empire; Resistance, Repression and Revolt (2011)\n\n-  Innes - Inferior Politics; Social Problems and Social Policies in Eighteenth-Century Britain (2009)\n\n-  John - Behind the Balfour Declaration; Britain's Great War Pledge to Lord Rothschild\n\n-  Lord Kimberley's Defence of the Government Brothel System in Hong Kong (1882)\n\n-  Lovell - The Opium War; Drugs, Dreams and the Making of China (2011)\n\n-  Mead - The Sepoy Revolt; Its Causes &amp; Its Consequences, 2e (1858)\n\n-  Motte - The Opium Monopoly (1920)\n\n-  Newman - The Cure of the Great Social Evil, with Special Reference to Recent Laws Delusively Called Contagious Diseases' Acts (1869)\n\n-  Phillbrick - Bunker Hill; a City, a Siege, a Revolution (2013)\n\n-  Porter - The Lion's Share; a Short History of British Imperialism, 1850-2004, 4e (2004)\n\n-  Quigley - The Anglo American Establishment (1981)\n\n-  Reid - Armies of the East India Company, 1750-1850 (2009)\n\n-  Schneer - The Balfour Declaration; the Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict (2010)\n\n-  Stewart - On Afghanistan's Plains; the Story of Britain's Afghan Wars (2011)\n\n-  Tambe &amp; Fischer-Tine (Eds.) - The Limits of British Colonial Control in South Asia; Spaces of Disorder in the Indian Ocean Region (2009)\n\n-  Wiener - An Empire on Trial; Race, Murder, and Justice under British Rule, 1870-1935 (2009)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:878efba239c54b96aeae94efcff00aa6ab71f5d5","amp;dn":"State-Sponsored+Terrorism%2C+Crimes%2C+and+Lies+-+Collection+12+%28Bri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"878efba239c54b96aeae94efcff00aa6ab71f5d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,142,251,162,57,197,75,150,174,174,148,239,207,240,10,166,171,113,245,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
