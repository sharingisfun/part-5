WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still driven by primal instincts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially when it comes to romance. Why do nice guys finish last? Why do women love bad boys? The answer is simple: theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re programmed to. In Women: A Textbook for Men, Oleg Novoselov uses common-sense language and vivid, compelling anecdotes to delve into the primordial urges that drive the female psyche. By understanding what women really want and why, any man can learn to develop his own leadership instincts and become the alpha male every woman desires.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ada3e97540837b42af8758e01c5ebdd204699f6","amp;dn":"Women+-+A+Textbook+for+Men+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ada3e97540837b42af8758e01c5ebdd204699f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,218,62,151,84,8,55,180,42,248,117,142,1,197,235,221,32,70,153,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
