We are introduced to a new dolphin named &quot;Mandy.&quot; Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA) has rescued Mandy after she was stranded near a beach and discovered by a little girl. Mandy has a bad sunburn and some respiratory problems from being stranded in the sun too long with her blowhole mostly exposed. She is being rehabilitated at the aquarium.\n\nWinter has a friend at CMA named Panama. Like Winter, Panama cannot return to the ocean. Panama is deaf and is quite old for a dolphin. She is expected to be at least 40 years old. It is alluded to that Panama has some health issues and it appears by Winter's erratic actions that she is concerned about her dolphin friend. Sawyer is approached by a professor from Boston University about attending an elite SEA Semester program for three months. Only one high school student per year is selected for this program, which takes place on a tall sailing ship and focuses on marine mammal research. It comes with a full scholarship and his family is excited for him to have this opportunity. Sawyer is unsure whether he wants to go, as he is concerned about leaving Winter for an extended period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy movie !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde1b0800c382d860050539f7a3efab7c4833e78","amp;dn":"Dolphin+Tale+2+AVC+AAC+mp4.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde1b0800c382d860050539f7a3efab7c4833e78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,225,176,128,12,56,45,134,0,80,83,159,122,62,250,183,196,131,62,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
