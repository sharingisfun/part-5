Joseph Weiss integrates a stakeholder perspective with an issues-oriented approach so students look at how a businessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions affect not just share price and profit but the well-being of employees, customers, suppliers, the local community, the larger society, other nations, and the environment. \n\nWeiss uses a wealth of contemporary examples, including twenty-three customized cases that immerse students directly in recent business ethics dilemmas and ask them to consider how they would resolve them. The recent economic collapse raised ethical issues that have yet to be resolvedÃ¢â‚¬â€there could not be a better time for a fully updated edition of WeissÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic, accessible blend of theory and practice.\n\nNew to the Sixth Edition!\n\nNew Cases! Fourteen of the twenty-three cases in this book are brand new to this edition. They touch on issues such as cyberbullying, fracking, neuromarketing, and for-profit education and involve institutions like Goldman Sachs, Google, Kaiser Permanente, Walmart, Ford, and Facebook. \n\nUpdated Throughout! The text has been updated with the latest research, including new national ethics survey data, perspectives on generational differences, and global and international issues. Each chapter includes recent business press stories touching on ethical issues. \n\nNew Feature! Several chapters now feature a unique Point/Counterpoint exercise that challenges students to argue both sides of a contemporary issue, such as too-big-to-fail institutions, the Boston bomber Rolling Stone cover, student loan debt, online file sharing, and questions raised by social media.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a98fd79b292aa0fc3cf134ce4e075913f8720e","amp;dn":"Business+Ethics%2C+6E-+Weiss+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a98fd79b292aa0fc3cf134ce4e075913f8720e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,169,143,215,155,41,42,160,252,60,241,52,206,78,7,89,19,248,114,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
