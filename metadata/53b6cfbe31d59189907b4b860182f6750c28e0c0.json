Prospero's Books uses Shakespeare as a foundation and then skips along to define its own lush territory. The books of the title are briefly referenced in The Tempest -- Prospero is a magician who gets to keep only a small fragment of his enormous library when he is exiled with his daughter to an enchanted island. In the film, Prospero is played by Sir John Gielgud. Indeed, everybody is voiced by Gielgud as he describes the events that unfold. But mostly, he describes the books, and as he does, the screen fills with florid calligraphies, astonishing diagrams, extravagant paintings, and lots and lots of naked people.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Prospero's Books.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,019,850,240 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:00:39\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 712x392 (AR: 1.816)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1775 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.254 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102722/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102722/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese (idx/sub)\n\nMy rip of a custom-subbed DVD posted at Cinematik by elhippie, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b6cfbe31d59189907b4b860182f6750c28e0c0","amp;dn":"Prospero%5C%27s+Books+%28Peter+Grenaway%2C+1991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b6cfbe31d59189907b4b860182f6750c28e0c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,182,207,190,49,213,145,137,144,123,75,134,1,130,246,117,12,40,224,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
