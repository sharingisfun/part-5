The band performed an extended set that featured songs from AnthraxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entire catalogue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all the fan-favorites including Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Am The Law,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Indians,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Madhouse,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Caught In A Mosh,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Devil You Know,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Alive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chile On HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be available on DVD and Blu-Ray, was recorded in 5.1 Surround Sound, and will retail for $16.98.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Santiago was the perfect place to film the show for this,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said AnthraxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Charlie Benante. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d played there in the past, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d finish our set, play our encore and go back to the dressing room. But every time, the fans would continue to scream and cheer and clap. I mean, they went on and on, they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop. One time Scott and I walked out to the side of the stage just to watch what was going on in the audience, it was intense. Why wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we want to film a DVD in front of an audience like that?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Plus,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Benante continued, the time was right to do this DVD.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The band was in the home stretch of a three-plus-year campaign to record and support Worship Music and the Anthems EP, a period of time that was loaded with high points: the return of Ã¢â‚¬Å“classic eraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ vocalist Joey Belladonna, Worship Music making the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest chart debut in two decades, the series of Big Four shows Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Anthrax, Metallica, Slayer and Metallica, the four bands that wrote the speed and thrash metal road map Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that culminated in the September 2011 Big Four spectacular at Yankee Stadium in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home town of New York, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anthrax DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ declared in the Bronx, becoming the first metal band to have its music (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Got The TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) played on Mars, two Grammy nominations, and sold out shows in every corner of the globe. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We wanted to finish on a high note,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Benante continued, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to look back and regret that we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t record the live show.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Chile On HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was produced by Jay Ruston and filmed by City Drive Entertainment Group and DC3 Global. The DVDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover art was designed by Stephen Thompson who partnered with Benante to Ã¢â‚¬Å“redesignÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the artwork from last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Anthems EP.\n\n\n\nLine-up:\n\nJoey Belladonna - vocals\nScott Ian - guitar\nCharlie Benante - drums\nFrank Bello - bass\nJon Donais - lead guitar\n\n\nAnthrax - ÃÂ¡hile On Hell (2014)\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
