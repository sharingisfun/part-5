A JTQ Collection is the most representative set of the band&amp;#039;s work until Hammond-Ology (a double disc) a few years later. Released as a joint effort between Acid Jazz and Music Club, it is loaded with 17 burning cuts ranging from raw, woolly spy-groovers like &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; and &quot;Theme from Dirty Harry&quot; by Lalo Schifrin to the monstrous U.K. hit the band had with its instrumental meltdown reading of Led Zeppelin&amp;#039;s &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; to the funky, soulful groove jazz of tracks such as &quot;3 Mile Island,&quot; &quot;One Way Street,&quot; and &quot;In the Hand of the Inevitable.&quot; The harder-driving funked-up jazz-rock (and that doesn&amp;#039;t mean fusion) on &quot;Europa&quot; and &quot;Check It Out&quot; illustrate yet another side of the band&amp;#039;s seemingly limitless forte at the time, just as slower tunes like a fine instrumental cover of Paul Simon&amp;#039;s &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; and the gorgeous &quot;Love Ballad&quot; do their soulful side. If you can hunt this baby down, it&amp;#039;ll be cheap, it sounds great, and it has decent liners. Well worth investigating, but be forewarned: you&amp;#039;ll be digging for the original albums before long should you attempt a listen.\n\n\n\n01. Love Will Keep Us Together (Feat.
