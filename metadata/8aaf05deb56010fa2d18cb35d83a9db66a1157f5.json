She has an appealing voice, strong lyrics, and memorable melodies -- that is, when she delivers. Unfortunately, many of her albums are uneven, with Nova delivering the goods as often as she misses the mark. The best moments on her second album, Oyster, rank among her very best work, demonstrating that she can pull off ballads, guitar pop, and hard rock with equal aplomb. The rest of the album isn't so much bad as it is bland, offering lesser versions of the good stuff. Certainly, Nova makes Oyster worth exploring -- it's just a little frustrating that the entire album doesn't deliver on the promise of its best moments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aaf05deb56010fa2d18cb35d83a9db66a1157f5","amp;dn":"Heather+Nova+-+Oyster+%5B1994%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aaf05deb56010fa2d18cb35d83a9db66a1157f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,175,5,222,181,96,16,250,45,24,203,53,216,58,157,182,106,17,87,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
