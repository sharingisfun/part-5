The way I see it, the best way to use access to both worlds is to illuminate and reveal, not idolize and adore. It's better to be wrong than to be played for a fool. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Colin Cowherd\n\nIn this age of billion dollar athletic marketing campaigns, Ã¢â‚¬Å“feel goodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ philosophy with no connection to reality, and a Sports Media echo chamber thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all too eager swallow whatever idiotic notion happens to be in vogue at the moment, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tough to find people who arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to say what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really thinking. \n\nBut thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where Colin Cowherd comes in. As his millions of fans on ESPN Radio and ESPNU already know, Colin is the rare sports analyst whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brave (or crazy) enough to speak his mindÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it pisses some people off. Of course, it helps that a lot of what Colin has to say is simply hilarious. Lots of writers can tell you about BostonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s storied sports history. But how many can tell you why the city of Boston is AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five year old? Lots of writers will brag about the stuff they got right, but how many will happily list all the calls they got completely and utterly wrong? Whether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pointing out the stupidity of conspiracy theories, explaining why media bias isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t nearly as big a deal as many assume, or calling out those who prize short term wins over sustainability, Colin is smart, thought-provoking, and laugh-out-loud funny. Some of the questions heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not afraid to ask in You Herd Me! include:\n\nIs Tiger Woods really a sex addictÃ¢â‚¬â€or does he just have good PR?\nIs Ã¢â‚¬Å“work-life balanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ really the ideal we should all strive forÃ¢â‚¬â€or is that just a way for people feel better about mediocrity?\nIs talent really all itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cracked up to beÃ¢â‚¬â€or can too much talent actually be counterproductive?\nIs the X games really a sportÃ¢â‚¬â€or would we all be better off if we admitted itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something else entirely?\nIs Hell really a supernatural place of fire and brimstoneÃ¢â‚¬â€or is it actually just another word for living in Tampa?\n\nUnapologetically entertaining and packed with behind-the-scenes insights you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get anywhere else, You Herd Me! is unlike any other sports book ever written.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05fc624e2e12681f7f768dd9d1d3fb32b87aee14","amp;dn":"You+Herd+Me%21-+Colin+Cowherd+-+Colin+Cowherd+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05fc624e2e12681f7f768dd9d1d3fb32b87aee14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,252,98,78,46,18,104,31,127,118,141,217,209,211,251,50,184,122,238,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
