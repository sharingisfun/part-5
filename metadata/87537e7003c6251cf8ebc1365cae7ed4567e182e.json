You will discover the difference between 'doing a Dracula' and 'talking Chutney'. You will meet 'Pop' and 'Bob', two characters who will help you with the gentle D and aggressive T. We'll cover the knotty question of 'To Spit or Not to Spit' your Ts, and tackle even more common speech problems.\n\nThe way we speak can say as much about us as the clothes we wear, the car we drive, or even the newspapers and magazines we read. Used properly, speech can help us to achieve a greater level of success.\n\nWe live and work in a global market - but English is still regarded as the international language of business. Clear speech sends out the message 'I am in control' - inspiring confidence in those around you. Clear speech will help you to maximise your potential, making you a greater asset to your company and your profession.\n\n'Improve Your Speech' is aimed primarily at those who have British English as their first language, but it is also useful for those with English as their second language.\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87537e7003c6251cf8ebc1365cae7ed4567e182e","amp;dn":"The+Lowdown%3A+Improve+Your+Speech+-+British+English+-+Level+2-Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87537e7003c6251cf8ebc1365cae7ed4567e182e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,83,126,112,3,198,37,28,248,235,193,54,92,174,126,212,86,126,24,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
