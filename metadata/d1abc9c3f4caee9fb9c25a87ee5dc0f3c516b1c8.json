This book, part of the Complete Guide series, explains functional training as any exercise routine that can benefit nearly any user, improving your ability to perform tasks required in your daily life, job, or chosen sport. It then explains how each movement included as part of your workout should mimic the range of motion and engage the muscles that are necessary to impact performance, whether on the basketball court or in day-to-day life, such as the ability to lift children out of their car seats.\nIt features more than one hundred functional exercises and detailed pictures and descriptions of all the techniques and how to apply them to your training program.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1abc9c3f4caee9fb9c25a87ee5dc0f3c516b1c8","amp;dn":"Complete+Guide+To+Functional+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1abc9c3f4caee9fb9c25a87ee5dc0f3c516b1c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,171,201,195,244,202,238,159,185,194,90,135,238,93,192,243,197,22,177,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
