Thousands of miles from civilisation, and facing the constant threats of searing heat and dehydration, Ed finds refuge in a desert oasis. Home to elusive desert bears, the oasis provides Ed with a source of water, edible plants and a base to make a rock and wood house. After a meagre start, he eventually catches some supper.\r\n\r\n2)  Guatemala \r\nThis time Ed must survive in the jungles of Guatemala. Dropped off on a small island in the Usumacinta River, Ed has to brave crocodiles to reach the jungle. Once there, he is swiftly reminded how tough it is to survive in a rainforest. Battling through dense foliage, he discovers a beautiful lake and sets up camp. But as it's the rainy season, he struggles to make a fire and can't catch anything to eat. Desperately hungry, he builds a raft and sets out onto the lake to fish, ever aware of the resident crocodiles. After nine days alone in the wild, Ed realises that he should make a dramatic offering in thanks for his survival.\r\n\r\n3)  Namibia \r\nEd takes on the parched bushveld of northern Namibia, in southern Africa. Dropped right at the end of a very long dry season, there are virtually no edible plants available to him. Undeterred, he makes base camp up a tree on the shores of a huge lake, spending each night on his home-made sleeping platform. He builds a huge fish corral which gives him a steady supply of small fish to eat, alongside a bird that he catches in a traditional bushman's trap. But his obsession with trying to catch a warthog sees him take his eye off the ball. How will he survive?\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen0.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen1.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen2.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen3.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen4.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen5.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/7/7b/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen6.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen7.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen8.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen9.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/8/83/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen10.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen11.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/1/12/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen12.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen13.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen14.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/5/54/Marooned-with-Series-2-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-22 (~4048 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.23 GB average\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marooned_with_Ed_Stafford#Series_4_.282016.29 en.wikipedia.org]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ca14c329299476ade86370812543dec366e200b","amp;dn":"Marooned.With.Ed.Stafford.Series.2.1of3.Gobi.Desert.720p.HDTV.x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ca14c329299476ade86370812543dec366e200b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,161,76,50,146,153,71,106,222,134,55,8,18,84,61,236,54,110,32,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
