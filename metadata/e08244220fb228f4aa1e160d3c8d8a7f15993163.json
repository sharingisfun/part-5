Connecting and using an Internet-based service is a frequent requirement for many applications. Java provides numerous classes that have evolved over the years to meet evolving network needs. These range from low-level socket and IP-based approaches to those encapsulated in software services.\r\n\r\nThis book explores how Java supports networks, starting with the basics and then advancing to more complex topics. An overview of each relevant network technology is presented followed by detailed examples of how to use Java to support these technologies.\r\n\r\nWe start with the basics of networking and then explore how Java supports the development of client/server and peer-to-peer applications. The NIO packages are examined as well as multitasking and how network applications can address practical issues such as security","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e08244220fb228f4aa1e160d3c8d8a7f15993163","amp;dn":"Learning+Network+Programming+with+Java+-+loseOut.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e08244220fb228f4aa1e160d3c8d8a7f15993163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,130,68,34,15,178,40,244,170,30,22,13,60,141,138,127,21,153,49,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
