She was called &quot;one of the most widely read and influential poets of the second half of the 20th century&quot; and credited with bringing &quot;the oppression of women and lesbians to the forefront of poetic discourse.&quot;\n\nRich wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose.  Her many honors include two National Book Awards for poetry.  She was the winner of the 2003 Yale Bollingen Prize for American Poetry and applauded by the panel of judges for her &quot;honesty at once ferocious, humane, her deep learning, and her continuous poetic exploration and awareness of multiple selves.&quot;  In 2006, Rich was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation, and in 2010 was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.\n\n\nThe following works were originally uploaded by livhre, who kindly gave me permission to reproduce them here.
