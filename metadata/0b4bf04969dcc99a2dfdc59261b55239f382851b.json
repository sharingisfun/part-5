Some critics accused Coltrane of capitulating to commercial pressures with this release, but that reaction overlooks the gorgeous performances on &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is,&quot; &quot;I Wish I Knew,&quot; and others. A beautiful album, and a great entry point for those who might otherwise find Coltrane's '60s work too abrasive. ~ CD Universe\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Coltrane, tenor saxophone\nMcCoy Tyner, piano\nReggie Workman, bass (#7)\nJimmy Garrison, bass (all others)\nElvin Jones, drums\n\nJohn Coltrane - Ballads Tracks:\n01  Say It (Over and Over Again)\n02  You Don't Know What Love Is\n03  Too Young to Go Steady\n04  All or Nothing At All\n05  I Wish I Knew\n06  What's New\n07  It's Easy To Remember\n08  Nancy (With the Laughing Face)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b4bf04969dcc99a2dfdc59261b55239f382851b","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Ballads+%281962%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b4bf04969dcc99a2dfdc59261b55239f382851b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,75,240,73,105,220,201,154,45,253,197,146,97,181,82,57,243,130,133,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
