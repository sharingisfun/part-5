King needs no introduction, and Library Journal calls Muller the first superstar of audio. In this program Muller tells King&amp;#039;s earthy story of perseverance in Shawshank Prison in raw, gutteral tones. Harsh though the story is, the delivery carries the intimacy of a friend talking to the listener from the passenger seat. While the reading was so riveting I couldn&amp;#039;t turn it off, there were times when it was so brutal I had to stop the tape. Muller&amp;#039;s flawless reading enriches King&amp;#039;s powerful story, providing a superlative audio program.\n\nDuration....03:53:52\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7954e76dbaae3973f5b14b3e4575a1c51fd14f83","amp;dn":"The+Shawshank+Redemption+-+Stephen+King+%5BAudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7954e76dbaae3973f5b14b3e4575a1c51fd14f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,84,231,109,186,174,57,115,245,177,75,62,69,117,161,197,31,209,79,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
