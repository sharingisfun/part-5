He was Napoleon, one of the most brilliant and complex figures in history. This absorbing appraisal of his life offers a new perspective of the little man from Corsica, who rose to new heights of power by seizing every brutal, outrageous opportunity in his path. \nIn 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte, a native of Corsica, crowned himself emperor of France, an audacious gesture that illustrated his overweening pride and ruthless ambition. Despite his diminutive stature, &quot;the little corporal&quot; loomed large over much of Europe for two decades-as an adroit statesman, military strategist and ruthless conqueror. This sweeping documentary reveals the private tribulations as well as the public triumphs of a complex historical legend. From the glory of his empire to his defeat at Waterloo and miserable exile on Elba, here is an entertaining and complete portrait of an extraordinary life.\n\nNarrated by Robert Whelan\nExecutive Producers : Bob Carruthers ; Gary Russell\nProducers : Gavin Bott ; Audrey Healy\nDirected and Edited by Chris Gormlie\nCromwell Productions 2001\n\n\n\n\n6)  Waterloo - the Final Curtain \nThis is the final chapter of Napoleon Bonaparte's extraordinary life. A chapter that begins with his enforced exile on the island of Elba. He busied himself building forts and bridges, winning the support of the local population and making plans for a return to France. When he did return, it was to an ecstatic welcome from his former troops and it was not long before he was reinstated as Emperor and at war once again. But there was to be no glorious ending to the tale. Instead it ended in spectacular and bloody failure in June 1815 on the famous battlefield of Waterloo. Napoleon's old enemy the Duke of Wellington once again beat his forces and this time there was no way back. Napoleon died in exile on St. Helena just six years later, but the legend of his military genius had only just begun.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2056 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x536\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.313:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 47:51.600\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 795 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75f0c6c31fd573067de4d8dc993a1fa40534417a","amp;dn":"HC+Napoleon+The+Man+The+Myth+The+Legend+6of6+Waterloo+The+Final+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75f0c6c31fd573067de4d8dc993a1fa40534417a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,240,198,195,31,213,115,6,125,228,216,220,153,58,31,164,5,52,65,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
