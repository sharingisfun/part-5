In addition to serving as a board-review guide, this will also be a handy pocket guide for any physician interested in a quick reference to drug tables, signs and symptoms, and other unusual facets of child or adult presenting with seizures.\n\nSeizures and Epilepsy, Second Edition has quickly reasserted itself as a modern classic and comprehensive textbook covering a broad range of both basic and clinical epileptology. Singly authored by Jerome Posner, this must-read from 1989 appeals to basic scientists who are interested in learning more about clinical epileptology, as well as clinicians who would like to understand more about fundamental mechanisms will find this text useful. This quick reference guide retains all of the benefits of the classic, in a pared down and easily manageable guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc9ea0e49619ce6c3b82a24c02b4a884c638fef","amp;dn":"Epilepsy+Board+Quick+Review+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc9ea0e49619ce6c3b82a24c02b4a884c638fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,201,234,14,73,97,156,230,195,184,42,36,192,43,74,136,76,99,143,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
