The first half explains in detail some classic card routines from his earlier career as a conjurer, all of which rely on sleight of hand, misdirection and audience management. The second looks at psychological card routines and shows a distinct move towards mentalism, for which he is now known. It is an instructional video for aspiring magicians and not an entertainment piece. For this reason, it was available only to practitioners through a password-protected &quot;magicians only&quot; area of his website. \n\nIt is an extremely rare release, so please SEED for as long as possible. \n\nEnjoy !!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eb612638b40345f3317f86c48892dbd4cdbc7bc","amp;dn":"Derren+Brown+%282002%29+-+The+Devil%27s+Picturebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eb612638b40345f3317f86c48892dbd4cdbc7bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,182,18,99,139,64,52,95,51,23,248,108,72,137,45,189,76,219,199,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
