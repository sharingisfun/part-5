The multi-talented performer parlayed his stunning guitar skills into a vaunted reputation as one of the hottest blues axemen on the West Coast during the 1950s. But that admirable trait wasn't paying the bills as the 1970s rolled in. So he totally changed his image to that of a pimp-styled funkster, enjoying more popularity than ever before for his down-and-dirty R&amp;B smashes &quot;A Real Mother for Ya&quot; and &quot;Superman Lover.&quot;\nWatson's roots resided within the fertile blues scene of Houston. As a teen, he played with fellow Texas future greats Albert Collins and Johnny Copeland. But he left Houston for Los Angeles when he was only 15 years old. Back then, Watson's main instrument was piano; that's what he played with Chuck Higgins' band when the saxist cut &quot;Motorhead Baby&quot; for Combo in 1952 (Watson also handled vocal duties).\nHe was listed as Young John Watson when he signed with Federal in 1953. His first sides for the King subsidiary found him still tinkling the ivories, but by 1954, when he dreamed up the absolutely astonishing instrumental &quot;Space Guitar,&quot; the youth had switched over to guitar. &quot;Space Guitar&quot; ranks with the greatest achievements of its era ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Watson's blistering rapid-fire attack, done without the aid of a pick, presages futuristic effects that rock guitarists still hadn't mastered another 15 years down the line.\nWatson moved over to the Bihari Brothers' RPM label in 1955 and waxed some of the toughest upbeat blues of their time frame (usually under saxist Maxwell Davis's supervision). &quot;Hot Little Mama,&quot; &quot;Too Tired,&quot; and &quot;Oh Baby&quot; scorched the strings with their blazing attack; &quot;Someone Cares for Me&quot; was a churchy Ray Charles-styled slow-dragger, and &quot;Three Hours Past Midnight&quot; cut bone-deep with its outrageous guitar work and laid-back vocal (Watson's cool phrasing as a singer was scarcely less distinctive than his playing). He scored his first hit in 1955 for RPM with a note-perfect cover of New Orleanian Earl King's two-chord swamp ballad &quot;Those Lonely Lonely Nights.&quot;\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Motor Head Baby Young John Watson 2:14 \n2 Highway 60 Young John Watson 2:24 \n3 Space Guitar Young John Watson 2:38 \n4 Half Pint a Whiskey Young John Watson 3:14 \n5 What's Going On Young John Watson 2:29 \n6 Sad Fool Young John Watson 3:02 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£0.79 View In iTunes \n7 I Got Eyes Young John Watson 2:26 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£0.79 View In iTunes 8\nJust Won't Treat Me Rite Chuck Higgins and His Mellotones 2:30 \n9 Walkin' to My Baby Young John Watson 2:32 \n10 Thinking Young John Watson 2:30\n11 No I Can't Young John Watson 2:24 \n12 Don't Touch Me, I'm Gonna Hit the Highway Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson &amp; His Orchestra 3:\n13  Gettin' Drunk Young John Watson 2:43 \n14 You Can't Take It With You Young John Watson 2:41 \n15 Stormy Chuck Higgins and His Mellotones 2:54 \n16 I Love to Love You Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson And His Orchestra 3:11 \n17 Too Tired Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson And His Orchestra 2:44 \n18 Someone Cares for Me Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson And His Orchestra 3:02 \n19 Those Lonely, Lonely Nights Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson And His Orchestra 2:55 \n20 Hot Little Mama Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson And His Orchestra 3:19\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ef763731d39a12a8eb4d80d21af6b0a9625d0b0","amp;dn":"Johnny+Guitar+Watson+Brothers+of+Soul++Early+Years+Collection+%28b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ef763731d39a12a8eb4d80d21af6b0a9625d0b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,247,99,115,29,57,161,42,142,180,216,13,33,175,107,10,150,37,208,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
