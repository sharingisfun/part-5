It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.\nI see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. \nOk pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. \nSurely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nJohn McLaughlin Discography - part 1\n\nA MUSIC torrent :)\n\nDig the musical experience of: John McLaughlin\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McLaughlin_(musician)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McLaughlin_(musician)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nJohn McLaughlin is one of pioneers and masters of jazz and fusion since the 70s since his collaborations with Miles Davis and his explorations of the indian music with Shakti or his fusion projects with Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Di Meola, De Lucia.... just to remember some names.\nA tremendously gifted guitarist but not only. As usual with my torrents I won't claim that this is his complete discography; anyway the 125 albums I collected here should satisfy the McLaughlin fans :)\n\nA big big thanks to hunterlucky60. The 70% of the material you will find here comes from his cyberlockers shares that I was still able to download even after the last pogroms on those sites.\n\nThe resulting discography was too big even for my usual enciclopedic standards so I split it in two parts.\nThis is the first part.\n\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot;
