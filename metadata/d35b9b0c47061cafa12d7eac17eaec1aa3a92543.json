StrikersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sophomore release Ã¢â‚¬Å“Armed to the TeethÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has turned heads Worldwide. Produced by multi platinum producer Michael Wagener, (Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne, Skid Row) Armed to the Teeth has sky rocketed Striker into the spot light.\n\nIncluding a direct support slot for MetallicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two sold out shows at Rexall place in their hometown Edmonton Alberta less than 10 days after its release. With a new World tour set to begin in spring 2013, Striker is at the forefront of the Canadian Heavy Metal scene for the whole World to see. Anyone in need of a daily dose of traditional Heavy Metal must not miss out on STRIKER!\n\n\n\nReview:\n\n\nQuote:\nI consider Striker as one of my favourite bands. These Canadians manage to create heavy metal that is very recognizable. You can hear various influences of other acts within their songs, but Striker does have an own sound. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t plagiarize or anything like that. The influences are from all over the place as well. On Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity Of GoldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ you can find influences of bands like Racer X, Iced Earth or Anthrax, but also WASP or Whitesnake.\n\nTherefore Striker has once again delivered a varied album, although I have to say that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit heavier compared to the previous albums. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit more thrash metal to be found on this new one. Striker recorded the album in Sweden at Studio Fredman resulting in a crystal clear and heavy album. Biggest selling point is that StrikerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s material is recognizable and catchy. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s candy to the ears and therefore one of the better albums that got released recently.\n\nRating: 9/10-up:\n\nDan Cleary - Lead Vocals\nTim Brown- Lead/Rhythm Guitar\nChris Segger - Lead/Rhythm Guitar\nAdam Brown - Drums\nWilliam Wallace - Bass\n\n\nStriker - City of Gold (2014) [Limited Edition]\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
