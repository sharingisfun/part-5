Perhaps, for the first time, Hayley can have a normal life, put aside her own painful memories, even have a relationship with Finn, the hot guy who obviously likes her but is hiding secrets of his own.\n\nWill being back home help AndyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PTSD, or will his terrible memories drag him to the edge of hell, and drugs push him over? The Impossible Knife of Memory is Laurie Halse Anderson at her finest: compelling, surprising, and impossible to put down\n\nGenre: Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc1e9adf2a34c2fb4065d1f634420c7bb6aaeef","amp;dn":"Impossible+Knife+of+Memory+by+Laurie+Halse+Anderson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc1e9adf2a34c2fb4065d1f634420c7bb6aaeef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,193,233,173,242,163,76,47,180,6,93,31,99,68,32,199,187,106,174,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
