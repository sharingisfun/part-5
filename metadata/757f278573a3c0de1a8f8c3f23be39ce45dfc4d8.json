YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to install VMware Workstation in any circumstance, and how to create virtual machines and keep different configurations for each virtual machine, which helps in setting up extensive test environments. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to share these virtual machines with users of other virtualization products as well as the cloud.\n\nIn VMware Workstation: No Experience Necessary youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start learning about different virtualization solutions. In this introduction youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how VMware Workstation differs from other workstation virtualization platforms such as Oracle Virtual Box, and from data centre virtualization solutions such as VMware vSphere. Next, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to install VMware Workstation on either a Windows or a Linux host and how to create virtual machines on these host platforms.\n\nAfter installing virtual machines, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn about advanced virtual machine features, including advanced networking and storage setups, which allow you to mirror a data centre setup as closely as possible. An important part of the setup of such an environment is working with snapshots and clones, which is discussed in detail. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to use virtual machines that are created on other host computers.\n\nThe final part of the book teaches you how to share virtual machines with others. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to upload virtual machines to VMware vSphere, and how to share virtual machines with users of VMware Player.\n\nWhat you will learn from this book?\n\n* Install VMware Workstation on Windows or Linux\n* Create Virtual Machines\n* Configure networking in virtual environments\n* Set up a DMZ-test environment on one single machine\n* Access Virtual Machines running on other computers\n* Multiply virtual machines by using clones\n* Easily revert to a previous Virtual Machine state by using snapshot technology\n* Upload Virtual machines to the cloud and vSphere\n* Share virtual machines with VMware Player users\n\nApproach:\n\nThis book is a practical, step-by-step guide to creating and managing virtual machines using VMware Workstation.\n\nWho this book is written for?\n\nVMware Workstation: No Experience Necessary is for developers as well as system administrators who want to efficiently set up a test environment .You should have basic networking knowledge, and prior experience with Virtual Machines and VMware Player would be beneficial.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author/s:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSander van Vugt is an independent author, consultant, and technical trainer, living in Netherlands.
