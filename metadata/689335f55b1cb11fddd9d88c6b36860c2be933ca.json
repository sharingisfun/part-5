Skipping across the country in a desperate attempt to stay one step ahead of the authorities, Peter quickly realizes that he's a psionically-charged 'Harbinger' with the potential to reshape the course of human history. But Peter's plight has not gone unnoticed. Respected philanthropist and fellow Harbinger, Toyo Harada is about to offer Peter the chance at the things for which the boy has always longed -- family, inner peace, self-control -- and induct him into a secret network of conspiracy and subversion known as the Harbinger Foundation. Now Peter begins his long road towards a destiny that will shake the very foundations of the Valiant Universe. His first lesson? All power comes with a price.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:689335f55b1cb11fddd9d88c6b36860c2be933ca","amp;dn":"Harbinger+%28001+-+025+%2B+Extra%29+%282012+-+Ongoing%29+%28Digital%29+%28Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"689335f55b1cb11fddd9d88c6b36860c2be933ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,147,53,245,91,28,177,31,221,217,216,140,107,54,134,12,43,233,51,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
