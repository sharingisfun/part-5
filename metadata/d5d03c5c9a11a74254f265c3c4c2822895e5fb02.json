The book reveals the facts about his suspended prison sentence, his dispute with the group over unpaid royalties and his retiring from the music industry , and his rumoured heroin addiction.Written with the full co-operation of GrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family and friends to give a unique access into the most fabled and feared man in the music business.&quot;\n\nMojo Review\n'Provides an illuminating read for anyone wondering about the ravages of rock supremacy. It's particularly good on the subject of Zep's peculiar movie, The Song Remains the Same. With the details of Zep's rise and fall receding into history, their legend and influence secure. this story's medley of tragic endings reminds us that no one is so powerful as to be immune to power's consequences.' \n\nThis is the retail epub and the mobi and pdf versions are converted with Calibre.
