But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring &quot;the Martian&quot; home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return.\r\n\r\ncast\r\n\r\nMatt Damon:...Mark Watney, a botanist who is part of the Ares III team.\r\nJessica Chastain:...Melissa Lewis, a geologist and the Ares III mission commander.\r\nKristen Wiig:...Annie Montrose, the director of media relations for NASA.\r\nJeff Daniels:...Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Sanders, the NASA director.\r\nMichael Pena:...Major Rick Martinez, the pilot of the Ares III mission.\r\nKate Mara:...Beth Johanssen, the Ares III's system operator.\r\nSean Bean:...Mitch Henderson, the Ares III's mission director.\r\nSebastian Stan:...Dr. Chris Beck, an astronaut and flight surgeon for the Ares III mission.\r\nAksel Hennie:...Dr. Alex Vogel, a German national who is the navigator and chemist.\r\nChiwetel Ejiofor:...Vincent Kapoor, NASA's Mars mission director.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat :mkv/AVC \r\nWriting Library :x264    \r\nDuration : 2h 21mn 37 \r\nBitrate :  5 358 Kbps \r\nResolution=Width/Height : 1 920  x  800 pixels \r\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat :  DTS \r\nBitrate :  768 Kbps\r\nChannels :6 Channels\r\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSample Rate : 48KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nRelease info:-\r\n\r\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG \r\nTitle/Year : &quot;The Martian&quot; / 2015\r\nFile Size : 6.18 GiB \r\nGenre : Adventure | Drama | Sci-Fi  \r\nSource : BluRay REMUX - FraMeSToR [Thanks]\r\nChapters : Yes \r\nSample : Yes \r\nSubtitles(VobSub): English(SDH),French,Spanish,Portuguese,Chinese.\r\nSubtitles(srt): English(SDH),Arabic,Spanish,Greek,Persian,Romanian.\r\nSubtitles(hardcoded): English were needed from myself   .\r\nIMDB :    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HCU \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HCz \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HC0 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HCJ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HCK \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HCZ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HCe \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HC4 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/HCB\r\n        \r\n\r\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|Hand_of_Doom|BADASSMEDIA|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d40ae7c2eb838053bff77e51ee94e73145c9516","amp;dn":"The.Martian.2015.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d40ae7c2eb838053bff77e51ee94e73145c9516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,64,174,124,46,184,56,5,59,255,119,229,30,233,78,115,20,92,149,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
