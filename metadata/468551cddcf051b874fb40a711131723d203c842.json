It stars Warren William, Joan Blondell, Aline MacMahon, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, and features Guy Kibbee, Ned Sparks and Ginger Rogers.\n\nThe story is based on the play The Gold Diggers by Avery Hopwood, which ran for 282 performances on Broadway in 1919 and 1920. The play was made into a silent film in 1923 by David Belasco, the producer of the Broadway play, as The Gold Diggers, starring Hope Hampton and Wyndham Standing, and again as a talkie in 1929, directed by Roy Del Ruth. That film, Gold Diggers of Broadway, which starred Nancy Welford and Conway Tearle, was the biggest box office hit of that year, and Gold Diggers of 1933 was one of the top grossing films of 1933.[2] This version of Hopwood's play was written by James Seymour and Erwin S. Gelsey, with additional dialogue by David Boehm and Ben Markson.\n\nIn 2003, Gold Diggers of 1933 was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;\n\n    CAST:-\n    Warren William as Lawrence Bradford, Brad's brother\n    Joan Blondell as Carol King, the torch singer\n    Aline MacMahon as Trixie Lorraine, the comedienne\n    Ruby Keeler as Polly Parker, the ingenue\n    Dick Powell as Brad Roberts, the songwriter and singer (aka Robert Treat Bradford)\n    Guy Kibbee as Fanuel H.

Warner\nWritten by : Avery Hopwood\nScreenplay: Erwin S. Gelsey, James Seymour\nMusic by \tHarry Warren\nLyrics by Al Dubin\n\nCharacter actors Sterling Holloway and Hobart Cavanaugh appear in small roles, as does choreographer Busby Berkeley (as a backstage call boy who yells &quot;Everybody on stage for the 'Forgotten Man' number&quot;).\nOther uncredited cast members include Robert Agnew, Joan Barclay, Ferdinand Gottschalk, Ann Hovey, Fred Kelsey, Charles Lane, Wallace MacDonald, Wilbur Mack, Dennis O'Keefe, Fred Toones, Dorothy Wellman, Renee Whitney, Jane Wyman, and Tammany Young.\n\nMUSICAL NUMBERS:-\nThe film contains four song and dance sequences designed, staged and choreographed by Busby Berkeley. All the songs were written by Harry Warren and Al Dubin. (In the film, when producer Barney Hopkins hears Brad's music he picks up the phone and says: &quot;Cancel my contract with Warren and Dubin!&quot;)\n\n&quot;We're in the Money&quot; is sung by Ginger Rogers accompanied by scantily-clad showgirls dancing with giant coins. Rogers sings one verse in Pig Latin.\n\n&quot;Pettin' in the Park&quot; is sung by Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell. It includes a tap dance from Keeler and a surreal sequence featuring dwarf actor Billy Barty as a baby who escapes from his stroller. During the number, the women get caught in a rainstorm and go behind a backlit screen to remove their wet clothes in silhouette. They emerge in metal garments, which thwart the men's attempts to get them off, until Billy Barty gives Dick Powell a can opener. This number was originally planned to end the film.\n\nFrom the 1933 trailer:\n\n&quot;The Shadow Waltz&quot; is sung by Powell and Keeler. It features a dance by Keeler, Rogers, and many female violinists with neon-tubed violins that glow in the dark. Berkeley got the idea for this number from a vaudeville act he once saw - the neon on the violins was an afterthought. On March 10, the Long Beach earthquake hit while this number was being filmed:\n\n    [it] caused a blackout and short-circuited some of the dancing violins. Berkeley was almost thrown from the camera boom, dangling by one hand until he could pull himself back up. He yelled for the girls, many of whom were on a 30-foot (9.1 m)-high platform, to sit down until technicians could get the soundstage doors open and let in some light.\n\n&quot;Remember My Forgotten Man&quot; is sung by Joan Blondell and Etta Moten and features sets influenced by German Expressionism and a gritty evocation of Depression-era poverty. Berkeley was inspired by the May 1932 war veterans' march on Washington, D.C. When the number was finished, Jack Warner and Darryl F. Zanuck (the studio production head) were so impressed that they ordered it moved to the end of the film, displacing &quot;Pettin' in the Park&quot;.\n\nAn additional production number was filmed, but cut before release: &quot;I've Got to Sing a Torch Song&quot; was to have been sung by Ginger Rogers, but instead appears in the film sung by Dick Powell near the beginning.\n\nMOVIE REVIEW:- Gold Diggers of 1933\nThe &quot;gold diggers&quot; are four aspiring actresses: Polly the ingenue (Ruby Keeler), Carol the torch singer (Joan Blondell), Trixie the comedienne (Aline MacMahon), and Fay the glamour puss (Ginger Rogers).\n\nThe film was made in 1933 during the Great Depression and contains numerous direct references to it. It begins with a rehearsal for a stage show, which is interrupted by the producer's creditors who close down the show because of unpaid bills.\n\nAt the unglamorous apartment shared by three of the four actresses (Polly, Carol, and Trixie), the producer, Barney Hopkins (Ned Sparks), is in despair because he has everything he needs to put on a show, except money. He hears Brad Roberts (Dick Powell), the girls' neighbor and Polly's boyfriend, playing the piano. Brad is a brilliant songwriter and singer who not only has written the music for a show, but also offers Hopkins $15,000 in cash to back the production. Of course, they all think he's pulling their legs, but he insists that he's serious Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he'll back the show, but he refuses to perform in it, despite his talent and voice.\n\nBrad comes through with the money and the show goes into production, but the girls are suspicious that he must be a criminal since he is cagey about his past, and will not appear in the show, even though he is clearly more talented than the aging juvenile lead they have hired. It turns out, however, that Brad is in fact a millionaire's son whose family does not want him associating with the theatre. On opening night, in order to save the show when the juvenile (Clarence Nordstrom) can't perform (due to his lumbago acting up), Brad is forced to play the lead role.\n\nWith the resulting publicity, Brad's brother, J. Lawrence Bradford (Warren William) and the family lawyer, Fanuel H. Peabody (Guy Kibbee) discover what he is doing, and arrive in New York to prevent him from being seduced by &quot;gold diggers&quot;. Their goal is to break up the romance between Brad and Polly.\n\nLawrence mistakes Carol for Polly, and his heavy-handed effort to dissuade the &quot;cheap and vulgar&quot; showgirl from marrying Brad by buying her off annoys her so much that she goes along with the gag in order to eventually pull the rug out from under him. Trixie meanwhile targets &quot;Fanny&quot; the lawyer as the perfect rich sap ripe for exploitation. But what starts as gold-digging turns into something else, and when the dust settles, Carol and Lawrence are in love and Trixie marries Fanuel, while Brad is free to marry Polly after all. All the &quot;gold diggers&quot; (except Fay) end up married to wealthy men.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English,\nRunTime 97 mins\nSubtitles: English, Espanol, Francais\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 97 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:468551cddcf051b874fb40a711131723d203c842","amp;dn":"Gold+Diggers+of+1933+DVD9+-+A+Busby+Berkeley+Collection+-+Classi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"468551cddcf051b874fb40a711131723d203c842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,133,81,205,220,240,81,184,116,251,64,167,17,19,23,35,210,3,200,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
