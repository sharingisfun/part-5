Its not as powerful as his late masterpieces but its, nevertheless, a great film.\n\nIve ripped it from the Eclipse DVD myself, with the English subtitles, translated the PtBr subs, and grab the French and Spanish from opensubs and resynchronized them.\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nPlot Summary taken from imdb\nSeveral stories by Birgit Tengroth intertwine. In 1946, nervous ballet dancer Rut and her husband Bertil are returning to Sweden from his scholarship tour around Italy. In a Basle hotel room and on a train they quarrel, give food through the window to starving Germans, overhear wisdoms about marriage by Swedish clergymen returning from a conference, and finally make up. In flashbacks, Rut reminisces her romance with middle-aged officer Raoul, her subsequent abortion, and her ballet career. In a seemingly separate episode set in quiet Stockholm during Midsummer, middle-aged widow Viola is harassed first by a psychiatrist, Dr. Rosengren, and then by a lesbian old school-friend Valborg, with tragic consequences.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-Bergman-Torment-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000M2E3GS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1213822263&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-Bergman-Torment-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000M2E3GS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1213822263&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75c6429841d00f45aff1991613b8cdde730fcf7e","amp;dn":"TORST+%28Thirst+-+Three+Strange+Loves%29_1949_Ingmar_Bergman_DVDrip_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75c6429841d00f45aff1991613b8cdde730fcf7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,198,66,152,65,208,15,69,175,241,153,22,19,184,205,222,115,15,207,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
