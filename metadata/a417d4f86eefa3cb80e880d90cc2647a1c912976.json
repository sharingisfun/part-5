It is the only full MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead album to feature Pete Gill on the drums.\n\nThe album's working title was Ridin' with the Driver and later changed to Orgasmatron; it was too late for Joe Petagno to change the cover art and the train design was used.\n\nIt features some of MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead's heaviest songs (&quot;Orgasmatron&quot; and &quot;Deaf Forever&quot;) and it is the album (along with No Remorse) that got MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead back on track after the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful 1983 album Another Perfect Day. The album reached number 21 in the UK charts.\n\nThe song &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; was re-recorded in 2000 and was available as an Internet download under the name &quot;Orgasmatron 2000&quot;. It was later included on the band's 2003 five-disc box-set Stone Deaf Forever!\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n    &quot;Deaf Forever&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n    &quot;Nothing Up My Sleeve&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n    &quot;Ain't My Crime&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n    &quot;Claw&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n    &quot;Mean Machine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n    &quot;Built for Speed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n    &quot;Ridin' with the Driver&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n    &quot;Doctor Rock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n    &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n\nDisc 2\n\n    &quot;On the Road&quot; [live] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59\n    &quot;Steal Your Face&quot; [live] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n    &quot;Claw&quot; [Alternative Version] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n    &quot;Stay Clean&quot; [live] (Eddie Clarke, Lemmy, Phil Taylor) - 2:33\n    &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; [live] (Eddie Clarke, Lemmy, Phil Taylor) - 2:56\n    &quot;Nothing Up My Sleeve&quot; [live] - 3:35\n    &quot;Metropolis&quot; [live] (Eddie Clarke, Lemmy, Phil Taylor) - 3:35\n    &quot;Killed by Death&quot; [live] - 3:39\n    &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; [live] (Eddie Clarke, Lemmy, Phil Taylor) - 5:34\n    &quot;Steal Your Face&quot; [live] - 4:33\n    &quot;(We Are) The Road Crew&quot; [live] (Eddie Clarke, Lemmy, Phil Taylor) - 2:34\n    &quot;Motorhead&quot; [live] (Lemmy) - 2:45\n    &quot;Bomber&quot; [live] (Eddie Clarke, Lemmy, Phil Taylor) - 3:45\n    &quot;Overkill&quot; [live] (Eddie Clarke, Lemmy, Phil Taylor) - 5:28\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Lemmy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, vocals\n    Phil Campbell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n    WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rzel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n    Pete Gill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a417d4f86eefa3cb80e880d90cc2647a1c912976","amp;dn":"Motorhead+-+Orgasmatron+%5BDELUXE+EDITION%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a417d4f86eefa3cb80e880d90cc2647a1c912976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,23,212,248,110,239,163,203,128,232,128,217,12,194,100,122,28,145,41,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
