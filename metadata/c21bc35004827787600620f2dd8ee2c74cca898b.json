This means that a BDRips are much closer to the Original quality than the BRRips.\nMZON3 encodes are BDRips. Better quality and no more faults in the encodes.\n\nx264 10bit Video?\n10bit encodes are the latest innovation from the x264 Devs. 10bit reduces quality loss and has the ability to hold more bitrate/quality compared to the x264/XviD alone. Plus, with the Higher Quality it even reduces the file size. MZON3 encodes will be on x264 10bit because we admire quality and size in the perfect combination.\n\nAAC Audio?\nCompared to the AC3/MP3, AAC delivers the ultimate audio experience. With the outputs supporting crisp audio, AAC audio makes any MZON3 encode superior than any other!\n\nWhat is .mkv format?\nThe new file format which enables Video, Audio and Subtitles to be placed in a single file. Being compatible on many hardware devices and every video player, .mkv is the choice of MZON3 due to itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Universal compatibility and the easiness to use.\n\nWith these latest codecs, MZON3 encodes are aiming for the Highest Quality for a smaller file size.
