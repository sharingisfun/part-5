He accepts a job by self-made millionaire Cyrus Kinnick (Michael Angarano), to show him around Vegas and provide him with protection while he gambles.\n    While eating at a diner, the waitress gives Nick a note from Holly (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who asks him to stop by her house. At her house, Holly explains to Nick that she had a date the previous night at Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Golden NuggetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. After the date, she was brutally raped and beaten by three unknown men in their hotel room. Holly tells Nick that she wants him to find out who they are so that she can sue them, though unbeknownst to Nick, she plans to take revenge.\n    Nick discovers that the man responsible for raping Holly is a gangster called Danny DeMarco (Milo Ventimiglia). It is also revealed that after raping and beating Holly, DeMarco had his two men to dump her in a hospital car park. Nick goes to the hotel and tries to speak with DeMarco. After DeMarco and his men try to beat Nick up, Nick defends himself. After tying DeMarco and his men up, Nick calls Holly. After arriving at the hotel room, Holly contemplates castrating DeMarco and his men, though after DeMarco breaks down and begs for forgiveness, Holly decide to take $50,000 from DeMarcoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desk and leave. Outside the hotel, Holly splits DeMarcoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money with Nick, and decides to leave Las Vegas. After Holly departs, Nick decides to take Cyrus to a casino and gamble with his half of DeMarcoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s money. He suddenly has a winning streak, and eventually has a total of $506,000 in casino chips. When cashing in the money, Nick has a sudden anxiety attack and tells Cyrus that even though the $500,000 will last him for many years; it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough to last him for a lifetime. After going back to the casino tables, Nick loses all of his money in a single bet. When leaving the hotel, Nick is attacked by DeMarcoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s men, and has to fight his way out of the casino.\n    The next day, Nick goes to a meeting with Baby (Stanley Tucci), who happens to be the mafia boss of Las Vegas. It is revealed during the meeting that Baby has received a complaint from DeMarco. DeMarco claims that Nick broke into his hotel room, pistol-whipped him, and killed two of his men Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all to fund his gambling addiction. Baby warns Nick that if he cannot prove his innocence, he will be killed for assaulting DeMarco and for murdering two members of the mafia. Nick tells Baby that DeMarco is lying, explaining that DeMarco had raped Holly, and had killed two of his own men because they had witnessed him pleading for his life. To prove he is telling the truth, Nick tells Baby that when Holly considered castrating DeMarco, she had cut the side of his penis with garden shears. Baby asks DeMarco to pull down his pants and prove Nick wrong, but after he refuses, Baby concludes that DeMarco is lying and lets Nick go free.\n    After the meeting with Baby, Nick goes back to his local diner for some coffee. At the diner, he is confronted by Cyrus. Cyrus offers Nick another deal: $500,000 and a plane ticket to Corsica, if he can help him 'become' a man. While Nick is considering the deal, DeMarco and his men try to kill him. After realising that DeMarco wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop until he is dead, Nick finally kills DeMarco and all of his men. Before Nick leaves, Cyrus gives him a cheque for $500,000 and the plane ticket Ã¢â‚¬â€œ telling him that he has earned it. After accepting the gift, Nick and Cyrus say goodbye to one-another. Nick then leaves Las Vegas for good.\n\n=================================================================================\nFILM:\n=================================================================================\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Wild Card 2015 720p WebRip [ChattChitto RG].mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFile size                                : 650 MB\nDuration                                 : 1h 32mn\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 984 Kbps\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2015-02-03 15:59:36\nTagged date                              : UTC 2015-02-03 18:12:35\nWriting application                      : HandBrake 0.9.8 2012071700\n\nVideo\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 1h 32mn\nBit rate                                 : 825 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 530 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.40:1\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nStream size                              : 541 MB (83%)\n\nAudio\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nDuration                                 : 1h 32mn\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 280 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nStream size                              : 106 MB (16%)\nTitle                                    : Stereo\n\n=================================================================================\nCast:\n=================================================================================\n\n    Jason Statham as Nick Wild\n    Michael Angarano as Cyrus Kinnick\n    Dominik Garcia-Lorido as Holly\n    Milo Ventimiglia as Danny DeMarco\n    Hope Davis as Cassandra\n    Max Casella as Osgood\n    Stanley Tucci as Baby\n    SofÃƒÂ­a Vergara as Doris (also known as 'DD')\n    Jason Alexander as Pinky\n    Anne Heche as Roxy\n    Chris Browning as Tiel\n    Arielle B.
