Oh, Fortune is still an indie folk album at heart, with ManganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acoustic guitar and baritone voice giving every song its most basic foundation, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also the most ornate thing heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever done, often sounding more like the Swell SeasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lush pop than Bon IverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sparse Americana. The album starts with a waltz and ends with a two-minute horn solo, and the stuff in between is similarly eclectic, from the indie rock wallop of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPost-War BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the hazy, almost psychedelic folk-pop of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLeaves, Trees, Forest.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRows of Houses,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with its distorted guitar riffs and gang vocals, even borders on arena rock. Most of the songs have at least one moment where the band drops back, though, leaving Mangan alone in the spotlight for several moments before his backup players come rushing back in. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a clever move, a reminder that at the end of the day, this is still a Dan Mangan solo album. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2012/01/15/dan-mangan/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a49b1276281e7fe04bae2ea0ef83c2a7eab6d1b","amp;dn":"Dan+Mangan...Oh+Fortune%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a49b1276281e7fe04bae2ea0ef83c2a7eab6d1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,73,177,39,98,129,231,254,4,186,226,234,14,248,60,42,126,171,109,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
