One \nevening, while he's looking through his binoculars, he sees a naked girl in the \nwoods. He decides to go there just to find that same girl laying on a rock. \nSuddenly, a man with a pink bandage covering his face, stabs Hector in his arm \nwith scissors. Then a chase starts, leading Hector to a time machine that brings \nhim back nearly an hour in the past. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviewed by Roger Ebert\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?&lt;/a&gt;\nAID=/20090107/REVIEWS/901079996/1023\n\nTime travel in the movies is always about paradox. And it always drives me nuts. \nSometimes I enjoy that, in the same way I enjoy chess -- and that's a \ncompliment. My mind gets seduced in chess by trains of thought that are hypnotic \nto me but, if they could be transcribed, would be unutterably boring to anyone \nelse, since you always think of a chess piece in terms of its function, not its \nname: If this goes here and he moves there and I take that and he takes me back, \nand I reveal the check and he ... And if you're a grandmaster, I don't imagine \nyou think in many words at all. It's more like Hmmmm ... a-ha!\n\n&quot;Timecrimes&quot; is like a temporal chess game with nudity, voyeurism and violence, \nwhich makes it more boring than most chess games but less boring than a lot of \nmovies. It begins by introducing us to an ordinary sort of Spanish guy named \nHector (Karra Elejalde), who is sitting on his lawn of his country place using \nhis binoculars and sees a babe stripping in the woods. Now this is important. \nWhat he is witnessing is the outset of an event he has already participated in, \nbecause of time travel. And when he goes to investigate, he runs the risk of \nrunning into himself, which, for paradoxical reasons, he already knows. Not this \n&quot;he.&quot; The other &quot;he.&quot;\n\nI guess you can make up the rules of time travel as you go along, but whatever \nthey are, they have to be inexorable, and there have to be dire consequences \nwhen a mere mortal rips the fabric of the space-time continuum. The reason we \ndon't get more warnings of this danger, you understand, is that travelers into \nthe past tend to do things which inalterably change the future, so that their \npresent no longer exists for them to return to. I love this stuff.\n\nHector has a main squeeze named Clara (Candela Fernandez), but leaves her to go \ninto the woods, and finds The Girl (Barbara Goenaga), who has been assaulted by \n-- don't get ahead of me here -- and then a little later he meets the Scientist \n(Nacho Vigalondo, the movie's director), who puts him into what turns out to be \na time- travel machine, which had earlier, or maybe later -- now you're getting \nbehind me -- done something to lead Hector to sit on the lawn, or maybe see \nhimself sitting on the lawn, or maybe -- but now I'm ahead and behind -- and now \n(earlier, or later?) Hector wraps his bloody head (which I have explained in a \nreview I still haven't written) so he will not be recognized by two of the three \nHectors, although I am not sure whether this is Hector 1, 2 or 3.\n\nI apologize for the 142-word sentence. In time travel, bad things can happen if \nyou stop for very long. One of the crucial requirements is apparently not to \nmeet yourself coming or going, although if you are physically present twice at \nthe same time, what difference does it make if you see yourself, unless it \ndrives you mad? If I were to see myself walk into this room right now, I would \nsimply nod to myself and ask, &quot;Have you finished writing that review yet?&quot; If I \nreplied &quot;No,&quot; then I would say, &quot;Well, I have, so why don't we eliminate the \nmiddle man and you kill yourself?&quot;\n\nThat's not too harsh, because I would only be dying in the past of the \nunfinished review, see, and be here with my work all done. But then again, in \nthat case, how could I have written it before walking into the room in the first \nplace? I couldn't have, that's how, so that means I couldn't walk into the room \nand I would continue writing the review just as I am now, which means the \nparadox would be solved because nothing happened, which, as nearly as I can \ntell, would be positive proof that time travel exists.\n\nThese problems are dealt with in &quot;Timecrimes&quot; in a thrilling scenario involving \npossible death by falling off of a roof after getting up there in an unorthodox \nway, and trying to save the life of a woman one of them loves, maybe two, maybe \nall three. This is all done in an ingenious and entertaining way. As you might \nimagine, &quot;Timecrimes&quot; is not a character study. Hector doesn't have the time for \nthat, ha ha. In a time-travel saga, by the way, it is considered bad form to \nwonder what makes somebody tick.\n\nIf after watching &quot;Timecrimes&quot; you have the strangest feeling that you have seen \nsome of these problems explored before, you are (a) merely experiencing deja vu, \nwhich is the low-cost and safe alternative to time travel, or (b) remembering \nShane Carruth's splendid &quot;Primer&quot; (2004), which, if it didn't drive you nuts, \n&quot;Timecrimes&quot; will, or has, or vice versa. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.48 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 400 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2009-01-18 08:53:57\nWriting library                  : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
