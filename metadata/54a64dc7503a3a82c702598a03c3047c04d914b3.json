The book is a secular review of the Bible in which Asimov traces the evolution of contemporary Judaism and Christianity thought through the mythical stories of genesis, and highlights the influence of Babylonian, Persian, and Greek beliefs on Judeo-Christian beliefs.\n\nTo the above we have the book: &quot;The Bible with Sources Revealed&quot;, by Richard Friedman. It is a valuable book that presents the texts of the five books of Moses in different fonts and colors to indicate the different sources of these texts.\n\nThese are large books and occupy more than 210 MB of disk space.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54a64dc7503a3a82c702598a03c3047c04d914b3","amp;dn":"Criticism+of+the+Bible+-+Collection+14+%28Asimov%5C%27s+Guide+to+the+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54a64dc7503a3a82c702598a03c3047c04d914b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,166,77,199,80,58,58,130,199,2,89,138,3,195,4,124,4,217,20,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
