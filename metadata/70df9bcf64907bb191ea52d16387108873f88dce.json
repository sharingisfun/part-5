After recording six self-released albums between 1986 and 1992, the Dayton, Ohio-based band attracted a handful of fans within the American indie rock underground. With the 1994 release of Bee Thousand, the group became an unexpected alternative rock sensation, winning positive reviews throughout the mainstream music press and signing a larger distribution deal with Matador Records. Despite all of the attention, the bandmembers never changed their aesthetic, continuing to record their albums on cheap four-track tape decks and thereby limiting their potential audience, yet that devotion to lo-fi indie rock helped Guided by Voices maintain a sizable cult during the late '90s.\n\n  *Thanks to all of the original uploaders!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70df9bcf64907bb191ea52d16387108873f88dce","amp;dn":"Guided+By+Voices+-+Ultimate+Discography+%281987-2014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70df9bcf64907bb191ea52d16387108873f88dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,223,155,207,100,144,123,177,145,234,82,209,99,135,16,136,115,248,141,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
