Drawing on many interviews and featuring a gallery of rare photos, Clinton Walker traces the band's career through the life of their original front man, from small-time gigs to international success, up to Scott's shocking death in 1980. AC/DC's undiminished superstar status (they're the fourth-bestselling band of all time), and their indelible influence on a succession of genres from metal to grunge to rap, ensure that Bon Scott's presence continues to be felt strongly. Hightway to Hell offers the full story of this seminal rock figure. A consistent seller since it was first published here in 2001, Highway to Hell has been updated for this edition. New details that have come to light in recent years about the last hours of Scott's life have been added, enabling the author to dispel persistent rumors and myths and once more set the record straight","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5159212c4f3e81ac3d6a69f12e1e755daa938b9c","amp;dn":"Highway+to+Hell+%28Clinton+Walker%29+Retail+epub+mobi+PDF+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5159212c4f3e81ac3d6a69f12e1e755daa938b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,89,33,44,79,62,129,172,61,106,105,241,46,30,117,93,170,147,139,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
