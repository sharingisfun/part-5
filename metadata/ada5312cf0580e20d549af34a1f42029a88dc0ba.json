It's a well-known part of the festival's history that many of the participants played self-confessed lackluster sets. However, considering the surrounding circumstances in which this music was conceived -- not enough food or water, an abundance of drugs, and thunderstorms -- these artists manage to rise above it more often than not. What is most interesting about this box set are the unreleased tracks by the Band, Tim Hardin, Johnny Winter, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Ritchie Havens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ada5312cf0580e20d549af34a1f42029a88dc0ba","amp;dn":"Woodstock+25th+Box+-+%5BConcert%5D+-+1994+-+%28MP3-320kbps%29++%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ada5312cf0580e20d549af34a1f42029a88dc0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,165,49,44,240,88,14,32,213,73,175,52,161,244,32,41,168,141,192,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
