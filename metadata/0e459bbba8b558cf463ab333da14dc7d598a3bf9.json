With an international editor and author team from academia and such leading chemical companies as Bayer, BASF and DuPont, the text adopts a multidisciplinary approach and a practical point of view. Starting with polymer chemistry and thermodynamics, the book goes on to deal with measurement, control, and characterization, before tackling process development, safety issues, scale-up, and modeling. It concludes with emerging processes.\nWith its unparalleled depth of coverage, this will be the definitive reference on this topic for years to come. The impulse for this book comes from the Working Party on Polymer Reaction Engineering of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering, and internationally recognized experts from different fields in industry and academia have come together to put their knowledge in writing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e459bbba8b558cf463ab333da14dc7d598a3bf9","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Polymer+Reaction+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e459bbba8b558cf463ab333da14dc7d598a3bf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,69,155,187,168,181,88,207,70,58,179,51,218,20,220,125,89,138,59,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
