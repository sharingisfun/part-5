It didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t happen to people in the film, but it could have.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Considering the proliferation of non-professional actors in this movie, that statement probably isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t too far from the truth. In a departure from the intensely stylized, heavily choreographed camerawork that dominated his later masterpieces made after Damnation, he shoots Family Nest in a verite style with direct, environmental sound, location shooting, and editing thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bit too rough to be artful. As such, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a film thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s way more conventional than TarrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s later works, and not nearly as visually satisfying. The outlook of life here is so unrelentingly bleak that at one point when Tarr inserts a carefree montage at a local carnival that plays out with the accompaniment of pop music feels wholly out of place until Tarr concludes the sequence with a close-up of a character vomiting, a shock stunt that puts thing back on track. As in nearly all of TarrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s films, the dingy barroom is only escape from dingy houses that the characters live in, and alcoholism seems the inevitable reprieve from their miserable lives.\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : CsalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡di tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼zfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©szek aka Family Nest (Bela Tarr, 1979)\\Family Nest.avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 1.55 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 39mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 230 Kbps\nWriting application                      : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\nWriting library                          : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 2\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 39mn\nBit rate                                 : 1 964 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.256\nStream size                              : 1.37 GiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 1h 39mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 183 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 500 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8412a084be2ff5ec18613a633e1bf6b06deda3fe","amp;dn":"Csaladi+tuzfeszek+aka+Family+Nest+%28Bela+Tarr%2C+1979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8412a084be2ff5ec18613a633e1bf6b06deda3fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,18,160,132,190,47,245,236,24,97,58,99,62,27,246,176,109,237,163,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
