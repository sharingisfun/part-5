The range of solar cells spans different materials and different structures in the quest to extract maximum power from the device while keeping the cost to a minimum. Devices with efficiency exceeding 30% have been demonstrated in the laboratory. Solar Energy Engineering: Processes and Systems. Solar Energy Processes and Systems includes all areas of solar energy engineering. All subjects are presented from the fundamental level to the highest level of current research. The book includes subjects such as energy related environmental problems, solar collectors, solar water heating, solar space heating and cooling, industrial process heat, solar desalination, photovoltaics, solar thermal power systems and modelling of solar systems including the use of artificial intelligence systems in solar energy systems modelling and performance prediction.\n\nEnvironmental consequences of solar energy\nSolar desalination including indirect systems\nModelling and performance prediction of solar energy systems\nWorked examples and cases studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3b2bcab16fd377e59aa20e4a54f48d3c48ce43b","amp;dn":"Solar+Energy+Engineering+-+Processes+and+Systems+2009+%28Malestrom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3b2bcab16fd377e59aa20e4a54f48d3c48ce43b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,178,188,171,22,253,55,126,89,170,32,228,165,79,72,211,196,140,228,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
