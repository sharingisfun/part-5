Abrams | 1987 | ISBN 0810923513 | English | 128 pages | PDF | 19 MB\n\n\nRichard R. Brettell, Searle Curator of European Painting at the Art Institute, has selected major works by Manet, Monet, Renoir, Boudin, Seurat, Degas, Sisley, Cassatt, Pissarro, Cezanne, Morisot, Caillebotte, Forain, and Redon. Among them are such favorites as Monet's Beach at Sainte- Adresse and Field of Poppies, Berthe Morisot's On the Balcony, Degas's Millinery Shop, Seurat's majestic Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte, Renoir's Two Sisters, and Mary Cassatt's The Bath. Not only paintings, but superb watercolors, pastels, drawings, and etchings are included. The author has arranged them in a narrative sequence that gives the book a flowing relationship of text and image. In some cases, he singles out individual works for detailed discussion; in others, he groups them by subject, theme, date, artist, or medium, selecting the approach that best suits the individual work of art or its group","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6978a75b8202d987dbfa4697f82b6161ff51fd88","amp;dn":"French+Impressionists+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6978a75b8202d987dbfa4697f82b6161ff51fd88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,120,167,91,130,2,217,135,219,250,70,151,248,43,97,97,255,81,253,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
