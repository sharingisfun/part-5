Filmed from a screenplay by Robert Altman and Frank Barhydt, it is inspired by nine short stories and a poem by Raymond Carver. Substituting a Los Angeles setting for the Pacific Northwest backdrop of Carver's stories, the movie traces the actions of twenty-two principal characters, both in parallel and at occasional loose points of connection. The role of chance and luck is central to the film, and many of the stories concern death and infidelity.\n\nThe film was distributed by Fine Line Features, and released in the United States on October 1, 1993, to strong critical acclaim. A special DVD edition was released by the Criterion Collection in 2004, containing two discs, the collection of Carver's short stories and an essay booklet on the film.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Short Cuts.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format profile : OpenDML\n      File size : 2.06 GiB\n      Duration : 3h 8mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 566 Kbps\n      Director : Done with AutoMKV! 0.98.4 http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=140178\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : Yes\n      Format settings, GMC : 3 warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 3h 8mn\n      Bit rate : 1 106 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.174\n      Stream size : 1.45 GiB (71%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 3h 8mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 603 MiB (29%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0108122\n\nEnglish audio; English subpack (idx/sub), French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles (srt)\n\nExcellent Criterion Rip by porcupene (Secret-cinema), who deserves all credits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccef605f62fb607e063f2b4a5c0ff4c5784f3249","amp;dn":"Short+Cuts+-+1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccef605f62fb607e063f2b4a5c0ff4c5784f3249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,239,96,95,98,251,96,126,6,63,43,74,92,15,244,197,120,79,50,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
