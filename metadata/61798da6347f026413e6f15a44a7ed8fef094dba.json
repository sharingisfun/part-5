Juno Lewis, a singer and percussionist brought a strongly African element into the expanding band. The developing relationship between Coltrane and Sanders is particularly arresting, the two saxophonists both mirroring and expanding one another's ideas in stunning joint improvisations.\nThe beauty of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kulu SÃƒÂ© MamaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, recorded in 1965, is that it is informed by Trane's study of free form styles, but balanced by some classic quartet pieces recorded a few months earlier. Simultaneously psychedelic, spiritual, soulful, preaching, pleading, angry, accepting, unsettling and healing. A truly remarkable album. Essential Coltrane at his best.\n\n\n\nJohn Coltrane \n\nKulu SÃƒÂ© Mama\n\nRecorded in 1965, released in 1967 \n\n \n\n  CD / 2007 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
