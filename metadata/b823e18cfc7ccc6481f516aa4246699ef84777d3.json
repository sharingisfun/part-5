This book was written for those who want to get their lives organized and actually execute the things on their to-do list by changing existing habits. And let me say that changing your habits is possible. Using the habit-changing techniques I describe in this book, I have made many habit changes: I quit smoking, started running, started eating healthier, completed a marathon, doubled my income and got my finances in order, have almost eliminated my debt now, completed a triathlon, lost more than 20 pounds, and started a successful blog, and more. Read this book. You'll be amazed at what you can accomplish with this productivity system.\n\nZen To Done takes the best aspects of a few popular productivity systems (Getting Things Done, 7 Habits and others) and combines them with the mandate of simplicity. It makes things as simple as possible, and no more.\n\nDozens of readers have written to me with comments about how ZTD has changed their lives, made them more organized and less stressed, and has worked better than other productivity systems. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely worth a try.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b823e18cfc7ccc6481f516aa4246699ef84777d3","amp;dn":"Zen+To+Done+%28The+Ultimate+Simple+Productivity+System%29+-+Leo+Baba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b823e18cfc7ccc6481f516aa4246699ef84777d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,35,225,140,252,124,204,100,129,245,22,170,66,70,105,158,248,71,119,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
