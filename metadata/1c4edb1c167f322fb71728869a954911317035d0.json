That is where we met anyway, one of those places, after a concert. She was writing the screenplay for Nenette et Boni and something in our song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“My SisterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ had clicked with her, she asked us if we would like to make the music for the film. We had film scoring pretensions, soundtrack music had always been a thing of DavidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s from when we met way back (though we could barely play, we had dreams).\n\nIt seemed the right next move for us, it fitted with the energy and flow of our band. We had this thing about Miles DavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Lift to the Scaffold. Passing through Paris he stopped off at the studio with his band and recorded the score right there and then, in a day, watching the film for the first time and reacting musically. Seemed like a good place to start. I suppose the essence was there, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s how we began, and after a few fumbling months we delivered the music for Nenette et Boni, nervously. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s how it all started, maybe we just got on, had some kind of understanding; we have never really talked about it. I was told she said in an interview that we understand her films before she does; maybe thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true in some way, but I think she was just being gracious.\n\nApproaching each film has always asked us to step into an unknown, stretch ourselves and do things we did not think we were able. At the end we always feel changed in some way. This has fed into all our other music and is a contributing factor to why weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still struggling to catch our ideas after all these years, still frustrated and fascinated in equal measure. Other people have asked us to score their films, but we always reached a point where we realised that the freedom and conversation Claire affords (and expects from) us is not there, and then it becomes something different, making music for a purpose (money?) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ something weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re well aware we have never been very good at.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe soundtracks will be available for the first time together on CD, vinyl and download on Constellation Records and are released worldwide on April 26th 2011.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filmdetail.com/2011/02/02/tindersticks-claire-denis-film-scores-1996-2009/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filmdetail.com/2011/02/02/tindersticks-claire-denis-film-scores-1996-2009/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
