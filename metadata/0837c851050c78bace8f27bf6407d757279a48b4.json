Victorious and assured that evil forces had been confined, Sparda joined mankind and fathered Dante. However, Dante was not the only son Sparda had sired...\n\nDevil May Cry 3 unfolds an earlier chapter in Dante's history, before the original Devil May Cry, to the fateful clash between Sparda's twin sons, divided by the divergence of their chosen paths. The game increases the intensity of gameplay with a new &quot;style&quot; system, which adds an additional level of depth. Depending on preference, players can choose to use short-range, long-range, defensive or evasive play styles. Each system has its own range of gameplay features and players can choose to power up their favorite style for increased special attack abilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0837c851050c78bace8f27bf6407d757279a48b4","amp;dn":"Devil+May+Cry+3%3A+Dante%27s+Awakening+Special+Edition+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0837c851050c78bace8f27bf6407d757279a48b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,55,200,81,5,12,120,186,206,143,39,191,100,7,215,87,39,154,72,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
