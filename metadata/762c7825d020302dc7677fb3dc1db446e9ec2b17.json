Covers everything they ever recorded from 1930 to 1936.\n\nThe Mississippi Sheiks were one of the most popular string bands of the late '20s and early '30s. Formed in Jackson around 1926, the band blended country and blues fiddle music -- both old-fashioned and risquÃƒÂ© -- and included guitarist Walter Vinson and fiddler Lonnie Chatmon, with frequent appearances by guitarists Bo Carter and Sam Chatmon, who were also busy with their own solo careers. The musicians were the sons of Ezell Chatmon, uncle of Charlie Patton and leader of an area string band that was popular around the turn of the century. \n\nThe Mississippi Sheiks (who took their name from the Rudolph Valentino movie The Sheik) began recording for Okeh in 1930 and had their first and biggest success with &quot;Sitting on Top of the World,&quot; which was a crossover hit and multi-million seller. In fact, the song became a national standard and has been recorded by Howlin' Wolf, Ray Charles and many more. The Mississippi Sheiks' popularity peaked in the early '30s, and their final recording session happened in 1935 for the Bluebird label. By the end of their career, the prolific and influential string band had recorded well over 60 songs, including the successful &quot;Stop and Listen.&quot; Joslyn Layne (Allmusic)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762c7825d020302dc7677fb3dc1db446e9ec2b17","amp;dn":"Mississippi+Sheiks+-+Complete+Works+1930-36+%284CD-Document%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762c7825d020302dc7677fb3dc1db446e9ec2b17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,44,120,37,208,32,48,45,199,103,127,179,220,29,180,70,233,236,43,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
