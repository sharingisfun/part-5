Although the group was a trio in the early days, it was as the partnership of Roy Williamson and Ronnie Browne that it is best known.\n\nThe early 1970s saw the Corries reach their peak of popularity. They had several albums in the top 50 album charts in Scotland, and released a single: - &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; (1974). It includes Flower of Scotland and Roses of Prince Charlie. It was quickly adopted by world lightweight boxing champion Ken Buchanan whose fans sang it on his entering the ring. It was then taken up by supporters of rugby football as the unofficial national anthem and is still used at Scotland's rugby internationals. It has also been adopted as the national anthem at international football matches. The Corries' concerts frequently had the audience joining in spontaneously in the chorus of songs. The duo became closely identified with Jacobite songs, celebrating the final years of clan loyalty and military courage. In 1977, one of their best albums Peat Fire Flame was released. This saw a move towards love songs and celebrations of the landscape.\n\nAs a young man, Roy Williamson played rugby for Edinburgh Wanderers. However, he suffered from asthma and before a series of concerts he would deliberately cease treatment in order to provoke attacks and gain temporary immunity. During the Corries' 1989 tour, Williamson's health went into decline and he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He spent his last years living in Forres, close to where he spent his school years. He died on 12 August 1990.\n\nRonnie Browne continued recording and moved into acting, as well as expanding his career as a noted painter, including commissions for the 1990 Scottish Rugby team's Grand Slam victory. He toured as a soloist for a few years after Williamson's death, and even released a solo album, but never reached the same level of success that he achieved as part of the duo. He has now retired from performing.\nPaddie Bell made some solo albums following her departure from the trio, most notably with Irish musicians Finbar and Eddie Furey, but withdrew from the folk scene followed by a period of dependency on alcohol and anti-depressant medication. In the 1990s Bell, with the help of several friends and fans on the folk scene in Edinburgh, revived her singing career with a couple of new recordings and became something of a celebrity again. She died in 2005 aged 74.\n\nIn December 2007, The Corries were inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame at the Scottish Trad Music Awards in Fort William, promoted by concertina virtuoso Simon Thoumire's Hands Up for Trad organisation.\n\n\n\n\nLive At The Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh \n    \nThe Corries - 01 - Wha Wadna Fecht For Charlie     \nThe Corries - 02 - Liberty     \nThe Corries - 03 - Side By Side     \nThe Corries - 04 - Tramps And Hawkers     \nThe Corries - 05 - The Great Silkie     \nThe Corries - 06 - Lyceum Blues     \nThe Corries - 07 - Ye Jacobites By Name     \nThe Corries - 08 - Lowlands Away     \nThe Corries - 09 - Abigail     \nThe Corries - 10 - The Old Triangle     \nThe Corries - 11 - Dream Angus     \nThe Corries - 12 - Maids When You're Young     \nThe Corries - 13 - Bonnie Dundee  \n\n   \nThe Corries - Live From Scotland (I-IV) Volume 1\n     \nThe Corries - 01 - Fallaldy     \nThe Corries - 02 - Mingulay Boat Song     \nThe Corries - 03 - Lads Among The Heather     \nThe Corries - 04 - A Scottish Holiday (1)     \nThe Corries - 04 - A Scottish Holiday     \nThe Corries - 05 - Hugh The Graeme     \nThe Corries - 06 - Maggie Lauder     \nThe Corries - 07 - The Roses Of Prince Charlie     \nThe Corries - 08 - Dark Lochnagar     \nThe Corries - 09 - Loch Tay Boat Song     \nThe Corries - 10 - The MHM Song     \nThe Corries - 11 - Flower Of Scotland \n\n    \nThe Corries - Live From Scotland (I-IV) Volume 2\n    \nThe Corries - 01 - Lock The Door Lariston     \nThe Corries - 02 - Sunday Driver     \nThe Corries - 03 - Come O'er The Stream Charlie     \nThe Corries - 04 - King Fareweel     \nThe Corries - 05 - Yur Losin' Them     \nThe Corries - 06 - Ettrick Lady     \nThe Corries - 07 - Nancy Whisky     \nThe Corries - 08 - Sae Will We Yet     \nThe Corries - 09 - Lord Yester     \nThe Corries - 10 - The Reivers Galley     \nThe Corries - 11 - La-Di-Dum     \nThe Corries - 12 - Johnny Ra     \nThe Corries - 13 - MacPherson's Rant  \n\n   \nThe Corries - Live From Scotland (I-IV) Volume 3   \n \nThe Corries - 01 - The Portree Kid     \nThe Corries - 02 - The Sherramuir Fight     \nThe Corries - 03 - Jamie Raeburn     \nThe Corries - 04 - Chevaliers Muster Roll     \nThe Corries - 05 - Shoals Of Herring     \nThe Corries - 06 - Massacre Of Glencoe     \nThe Corries - 07 - The Friday Game     \nThe Corries - 08 - Battle Of Prestonpans     \nThe Corries - 09 - Weep Ye By Atholl     \nThe Corries - 10 - The Rattling Bog   \n  \n\nThe Corries - Live From Scotland (I-IV) Volume 4\n    \nThe Corries - 01 - Haughs O' Cromdale     \nThe Corries - 02 - Blues For Hughie     \nThe Corries - 03 - Hush Hush     \nThe Corries - 04 - Willie's Gone To Melvillie Castle     \nThe Corries - 05 - South Australia     \nThe Corries - 06 - Lowlands O' Holland     \nThe Corries - 07 - Bannockburn     \nThe Corries - 08 - The Rigs O' Rye     \nThe Corries - 09 - Ther Was A Lad     \nThe Corries - 10 - Battle O' Harlaw     \nThe Corries - 11 - Earl O' Moray     \nThe Corries - 12 - Killiecrankie     \nThe Corries - 13 - The Parting Glass \n\n    \nThe Corries - Scots Wha Hae, Battle songs of Scotland\n\nThe Corries - 01 - Stirling Brig     \nThe Corries - 02 - The Black Douglas     \nThe Corries - 03 - Scots Wha Hae     \nThe Corries - 04 - The Lammas Tide     \nThe Corries - 05 - The Battle Of Harlaw     \nThe Corries - 06 - Lock The Door Lariston     \nThe Corries - 07 - The Haughs O' Cromdale     \nThe Corries - 08 - Bonnie Dundee     \nThe Corries - 09 - The Braes O' Killiecrankie     \nThe Corries - 10 - The Sheramuir Fight     \nThe Corries - 11 - The News From Moidart     \nThe Corries - 12 - Johnny Cope     \nThe Corries - 13 - King Fareweel   \n  \n\nThe Corries - The Comedy Collection\n\nThe Corries - 01 - The Folker     \nThe Corries - 02 - Sunday Driver     \nThe Corries - 03 - A Scottish Holiday     \nThe Corries - 04 - The Portree Kid     \nThe Corries - 05 - La Di Dum     \nThe Corries - 06 - The Bantam Cock     \nThe Corries - 07 - Lucille     \nThe Corries - 08 - Big Nellie May     \nThe Corries - 09 - The Bricklayer's Song     \nThe Corries - 10 - The Tortoise     \nThe Corries - 11 - Yur Losin' Them     \nThe Corries - 12 - The Heiland House Hunter     \nThe Corries - 13 - The Friday Game     \nThe Corries - 14 - Kids On The Range     \nThe Corries - 15 - The Birth Of The Corries Blues\n\n     \nThe Corries - The Silver Collection \n    \nThe Corries - 01 - Killiecrankie     \nThe Corries - 02 - Rise!
