It covers key research in natural and synthetic fibres as well as fibre and fabric properties. There is broad coverage of processing technologies, including design and product development, yarn and fabric processing, colouration and finishing as well as environmental technology. The collection also covers key sectors such as high performance/technical textiles, intelligent textiles, medical textiles and clothing. The books will be essential reading for manufactures developing textile products, those using textiles in technical and apparel applications, and for academic researchers, who need help in synthesizing this research and summarizing key trends","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db87727aec2459c97e49f150d48dd4111498c919","amp;dn":"Woodhead+Publishing+Series+in+Textiles+%5BUpdated+at+2016.09.10%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db87727aec2459c97e49f150d48dd4111498c919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,135,114,122,236,36,89,201,126,73,241,80,212,141,212,17,20,152,201,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
