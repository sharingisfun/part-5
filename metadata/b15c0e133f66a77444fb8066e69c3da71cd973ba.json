My brother in law from chile is an example of what are\nclearly among the most able and strong and indeed clearly observably the most\nromantic men on the planet - only you don't see enough of his genre in his \nquality up here as yet - not enough to drag them away from their communities \nI gather. The perfect men - and Wow! this movie might just do it though, the\nbeauty of America as is the star of this show is &quot;to die for&quot;! A more \nsuited couple I suggest!\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo\n\nPlease check the net for subtitles as the Swedish ones we looked at were machine\ntranslated (using google translate) and we cannot validate them for you as\nwell as you that speak the various languages concerned. thank you\n\nwe did find perfectly matching subs quite quickly though for Dutch Polish\nand Romanian and so they are included here in tiny srt files optionally\nfor those that need them of course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15c0e133f66a77444fb8066e69c3da71cd973ba","amp;dn":"Whats+your+number+%282011%29+720p+HD+XviD+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+what%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15c0e133f66a77444fb8066e69c3da71cd973ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,92,14,19,63,102,167,116,68,251,128,102,230,156,61,167,28,217,115,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
