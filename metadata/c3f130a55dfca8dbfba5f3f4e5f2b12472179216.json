Opening with the truly otherworldly experience of title track 'The Ship' Eno carefully lays down a twenty minute plus blanket of slow moving, but fully immersive synths that start off sounding like the blurry jet lag memories of the morning after a night in his Music For Airports departure lounge. The track builds with a delicate, constantly evolving 77 Million Paintings style drone before his deeply lead vocals chime into the mix, this could honestly be an update on a lost recording from the b-side of Low.\r\n The rest of the album follows in a similar stance but over a three-part &quot;musical novel&quot; and takes in oceanic waves of sound to spoken word transcripts and ends on a tear-drenched cover of The Velvet Underground's I'm Set Free. Large parts of The Ship will be tugging at memories of Eno's previous work notably Airports and Another Green World, but it remains new and offers much to explore, the end caps on the words &quot;I'm set free, to find a new illusion&quot; and after The Ship we can't wait to hear where he sails to next.
