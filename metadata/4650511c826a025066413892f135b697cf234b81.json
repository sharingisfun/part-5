The client presented at the project runs under the Windows operating system, from the official website you can download a version for example for Mac OS X, version for mobile devices. Of course, it is worth noting a big plus of the program, it is very small and functional, it can be said that the program consumes almost no system resources, and understand it can each user. According to Wikipedia, the number of customer users per month amounted to 100 million in January this year, it says a lot, so I recommend to download uTorrent Â with our project.\r\nAmong a large number of all sorts of features can provide support for limiting the maximum speed as the input and returns the file, respectively, and these restrictions may be introduced on the time of day, such as the day you want the channel more than in the evening, it's possible to specify the settings, and each file on the upload speed you can customize. uTorrent can configure caching of files on your hard drive, of course, there is DHT and Peer Exchange support (for the exchange of information on the lists of participants in the system), there is also Super Seeding mode, which is a special mode of return.\r\nIf you subscribe to a feed in which there are torrent files, uTorrent can perfectly pull links from there and redirect them directly to the customer, if you want you can work through a proxy server, and connect to the tracker can be via HTTPS or UDP, there is support and encryption protocol. uTorrent fully supports UPnP Unincode and in all versions of the Windows operating system.\r\nIf we consider the interface, then it is quite easy to use, and has Russian support, and support for more than 50 different languages, all functions are clear, I think the problems with this should not occur. I forgot to add, of uTorrent can also handle magnet links, and you can still run the program remotely, via a web interface that can sometimes be very useful.\r\n\r\nDeveloper : BitTorrent Inc \r\nLicense : FreeWare \r\nLanguage : Multi + Russian \r\nversion size : 3.52 MB \r\nOS : Windows\r\n\r\n[b]How to Install:\r\n[/b]\r\nPortable Pro Vresion [No Installation Needed]\r\n1.
