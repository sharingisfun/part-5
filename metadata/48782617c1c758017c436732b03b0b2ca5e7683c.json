Silverman Professor of the Humanities at Columbia University and succeeded Martin Amis as professor of creative writing at the University of Manchester. He was hailed as a champion of minorities as he collected the 2011 Irish PEN Award. In 2011, he was named one of Britain's Top 300 Intellectuals by The Observer.\n\nTÃƒÂ³ibÃƒÂ­n's work explores several main lines: the depiction of Irish society, living abroad, the process of creativity and the preservation of a personal identity, focusing especially on homosexual identities Ã¢â‚¬â€ TÃƒÂ³ibÃƒÂ­n is openly gayÃ¢â‚¬â€ but also on identity when confronted with loss. The &quot;Wexford&quot; novels, The Heather Blazing and The Blackwater Lightship, use Enniscorthy, the town of TÃƒÂ³ibÃƒÂ­n's birth, as narrative material, together with the history of Ireland and the death of his father. An autobiographical account and reflection on this episode can be found in the non-fiction book, The Sign of the Cross. In 2009, he published Brooklyn, a tale of a woman emigrating to Brooklyn from Enniscorthy.\n\nTwo other novels, The Story of the Night and The Master revolve around characters who have to deal with a homosexual identity and take place outside Ireland for the most part, with a character having to cope with living abroad. His first novel, The South, seems to have ingredients of both lines of work. It can be read together with The Heather Blazing as a diptych of Protestant and Catholic heritages in County Wexford, or it can be grouped with the &quot;living abroad&quot; novels. A third topic that links The South and The Heather Blazing is that of creation. Of painting in the first case and of the careful wording of a judge's verdict in the second. This third thematic line culminated in The Master, a study on identity, preceded by a non-fiction book in the same subject, Love in a Dark Time. The book of short stories &quot;Mothers and Sons&quot; deal with family themes, both in Ireland and Catalonia, and homosexuality.\n\nTÃƒÂ³ibÃƒÂ­n has written about gay sex in several novels, though Brooklyn contains a heterosexual sex scene in which the heroine loses her virginity. In his 2012 essay collection New Ways to Kill Your Mother: Writers and Their Families he studies the biographies of James Baldwin, J. M. Synge and W. B. Yeats, among others.\n\n\nThe torrent contains following books in both ePUB and Mobi format unless otherwise stated:\n\nNovels:\n\n*  The South, 1990 -- ePUB\n\n*  The Heather Blazing, 1992 -- ePUB\n\n*  The Blackwater Lightship, 1999\n\n*  The Master, 2004\n\n*  Brooklyn, 2009 -- ePUB\n\n*  The Testament of Mary, 2012\n\n\nShort Story Collection:\n\n*  Mothers and Sons, 2006\n\n*  The Empty Family, 2010\n\n\nNon-fiction\n\n*  New Ways to Kill Your Mother: Writers and their Families, 2012\n\n\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.colmtoibin.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.colmtoibin.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/164960060/testament-of-mary-gives-fiery-voice-to-the-virgin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/164960060/testament-of-mary-gives-fiery-voice-to-the-virgin&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bookslut.com/features/2009_06_014545.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bookslut.com/features/2009_06_014545.php&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/26/colm-toibin-brooklyn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/26/colm-toibin-brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/interview-colm-toibin-20121108-28z7n.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/interview-colm-toibin-20121108-28z7n.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9615673/Colm-Toibin-you-have-to-be-a-terrible-monster-to-write.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9615673/Colm-Toibin-you-have-to-be-a-terrible-monster-to-write.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48782617c1c758017c436732b03b0b2ca5e7683c","amp;dn":"Colm+Toibin+-+Novels%2C+Short+Stories+and+Non-fiction+%289+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48782617c1c758017c436732b03b0b2ca5e7683c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,120,38,23,193,199,88,1,124,67,103,50,176,59,11,44,165,231,104,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
