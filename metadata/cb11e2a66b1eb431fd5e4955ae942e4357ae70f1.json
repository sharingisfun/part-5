After catching the attention of John Hammond, who recommended him to Benny Goodman, he appeared on fewer than 100 sessions between 1939 and 1941, mostly broadcasts, plus a few privately recorded sessions issued on various labels over the years, in addition to his well-known studio recordings  with Goodman. While the music in this compilation has been previously available, this collection has to much recommend it. First of all, new digital transfers have been made from original acetates from the Jerry Newhouse collection, rather than relying on later generation sources. \n\nIt is tragic that Charlie Christian died far too young from tuberculosis, but this rewarding collection is  excellent .\n\nTracklist:\n\nCharlie Christian Quartet[i] After Hours Jam Sessions\nHarlem Breakfast Club, Minnieapolos 24September 1939\nCharlie Christian-gtr Jerry Jerome - ts Frankie Hines- pno Oscar Pettiford- bass\n01.
