Instead of creating patches the conventional way by turning dials and knobs, Synplant lets you explore a world of organic sounds by planting seeds that grow into synth patches.\n\nOnce you are ready to get your hands dirty and dig deeper into the anatomy of Synplant you will have the option to crack open your sound seeds and modify their underlying genetic code.\n\nThe purpose of this product is to move focus away from the sometimes intricate and difficult process of sound synthesis and instead let you develop sounds by simply using your ears. You will find that creating synth patches with Synplant will be as easy as listening and deciding what you like and then having the sounds evolve in the directions you desire.\n\nAlthough Synplant is exceedingly easy to use, whatever you do, do not let its relative simplicity fool you. Beneath its straightforward and playful interface you will find a versatile synthesizer of the utmost quality with lots of character.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (04).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3adb94f87b85d2bb84ec84092870ff6d2bd7699","amp;dn":"Sonic+Charge+-+Synplant+v1.2+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3adb94f87b85d2bb84ec84092870ff6d2bd7699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,173,185,79,135,184,93,43,184,78,200,64,146,135,15,246,210,189,118,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
