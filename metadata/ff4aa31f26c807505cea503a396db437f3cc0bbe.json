His first crime novel featuring Harry Hole was published in Norway in 1997 and was an instant hit, winning the Glass Key Award for Best Nordic Crime Novel (an accolade shared with Peter HÃƒÂ¸eg, Henning Mankell and Karin Fossum).\n\nHarry Hole:\nThe Redbreast (#3): The Redbreast is a chilling tale of murder and betrayal that ranges from the battlefields of World War Two to the streets of modern-day Oslo. Follow Hole as he races to stop a killer and disarm a ticking time-bomb from his nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadowy past. Vogue magazine says that Ã¢â‚¬Å“nobody can delve into the dark, twisted mind of a murderer better than a Scandinavian thriller writerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦and nobody does it better than Jo NesbÃƒÂ¸! James Patterson fans should also take note.\n\nNemesis (#4): A man walks into an Oslo bank, puts a gun to a cashier's head, and tells her to count to twenty-five. When he doesn't get his money fast enough, he pulls the trigger. The young woman diesÃ¢â‚¬â€and two million Norwegian kroner disappear without a trace.\n\nAfter a drunken evening with former girlfriend Anna Bethsen, Police Detective Harry Hole wakes up at home with a headache, no cell phone, and no memory of the past twelve hours. The same day, Anna is found shot dead in her bedroom, making Hole a prime suspect in the investigation led by his hated adversary, Tom Waaler. Meanwhile, the bank robberies continue with unparalleled savagery, sending rogue detective Hole from the streets of Oslo to steaming Brazil in a race to close two cases and clear his name. But Waaler isn't finished with his longtime nemesis quite yet.\n\nThe Devil's Star (#5): In the heat of a sweltering Oslo summer, a young woman is found murdered in her flatÃ¢â‚¬â€with one of her fingers cut off and a tiny red star-shaped diamond placed under her eyelid. An off-the-rails alcoholic barely holding on to his job, Detective Harry Hole is assigned the case with Tom Waaler, a hated colleague whom Harry believes is responsible for the murder of his partner. When another woman is reported missing five days later, and her severed finger turns up adorned with a red star-shaped diamond ring, Harry fears a serial killer is at work. But Hole's determination to capture a fiend and to expose Waaler's crimes is leading him into shadowy places where both investigations merge in unexpected ways, forcing him to make difficult decisions about a future he may not live to see.\n\nThe Redeemer (#6): Christmas shoppers stop to hear a Salvation Army concert on a crowded Oslo street. A gunshot cuts through the music and the bitter cold: one of the singers falls dead, shot in the head at point-blank range. Harry HoleÃ¢â‚¬â€the Oslo Police DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best investigator and worst civil servantÃ¢â‚¬â€has little to work with: no suspect, no weapon, and no motive. But HarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubles will multiply. As the search closes in, the killer becomes increasingly desperate, and HarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chase takes him to the most forbidden corners of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nYet itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when he returns to Oslo that he encounters true darkness: among the homeless junkies and Salvationists, eagerly awaiting a savior to deliver them from miseryÃ¢â‚¬â€whether he brings new life or immediate death. \n\nWith its shrewdly vertiginous narrative, acid-etched characters, and white-hot pace, The Redeemer is resounding proof of Jo NesbÃƒÂ¸Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s standing as one of the best crime writers of our time.\n\nThe Snowman (#7): Oslo in November. The first snow of the season has fallen. A boy named Jonas wakes in the night to find his mother gone. Out his window, in the cold moonlight, he sees the snowman that inexplicably appeared in the yard earlier in the day. Around its neck is his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pink scarf. \n\nHole suspects a link between a menacing letter heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s received and the disappearance of JonasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motherÃ¢â‚¬â€and of perhaps a dozen other women, all of whom went missing on the day of a first snowfall. As his investigation deepens, something else emerges: he is becoming a pawn in an increasingly terrifying game whose rules are devisedÃ¢â‚¬â€and constantly revisedÃ¢â‚¬â€by the killer.\n\nFiercely suspenseful, its characters brilliantly realized, its atmosphere permeated with evil, The Snowman is the electrifying work of one of the best crime writers of our time.\n\nThe Leopard (#8): Two young women are found murdered in Oslo, both drowned in their own blood. Media coverage quickly reaches fever pitch: Could this be the work of a serial killer? \n\nThe crime scenes offer no coherent clues, the police investigation is stalled, and the one man who might be able to help doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be found. Traumatized by his last case, Inspector Harry Hole has lost himself in the squalor of Hong KongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opium dens. Yet when he is compelled, at last, to return to NorwayÃ¢â‚¬â€his father is dyingÃ¢â‚¬â€HarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s buried instincts begin to take over. After a female MP is discovered brutally murdered, nothing can keep him from the investigation. \n\nThere is little to go on: a piece of rope, a scrap of wool, a bit of gravel, an unexpected connection between the victims. And Harry will soon come to understand that he is dealing with a psychopath for whom Ã¢â‚¬Å“insanity is a vital retreat,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ someone who will put him to the testÃ¢â‚¬â€in both his professional and personal livesÃ¢â‚¬â€as never before.\n\nPhantom (#9): When Harry left Oslo again for Hong KongÃ¢â‚¬â€fleeing the traumas of life as a copÃ¢â‚¬â€he thought he was there for good. But then the unthinkable happened. The son of the woman he loved, lost, and still loves is arrested for murder: Oleg, the boy Harry helped raise but couldn't help deserting when he fled. Harry has come back to prove that Oleg is not a killer. Barred from rejoining the police force, he sets out on a solitary, increasingly dangerous investigation that takes him deep into the world of the most virulent drug to ever hit the streets of Oslo (and the careers of some of the city's highest officials), and into the maze of his own past, where he will find the wrenching truth that finally matters to Oleg, and to himself.\n\nNovel:\nHeadhunters: Roger Brown is a corporate headhunter, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a master of his profession. But one career simply canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t support his luxurious lifestyle and his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fledgling art gallery. At an art opening one night he meets Clas Greve, who is not only the perfect candidate for a major CEO job, but also, perhaps, the answer to his financial woes: Greve just so happens to mention that he owns a priceless Peter Paul Rubens painting thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been lost since World War IIÃ¢â‚¬â€and Roger Brown just so happens to dabble in art theft. But when he breaks into GreveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment, he finds more than just the painting. And Clas Greve may turn out to be the worst thing thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever happened to Roger Brown.\n\nFull US Retail. Calibre and ePub Reader ready.
