I bought this book to share it with you foremost. SCIENCE FOR THE PEOPLE! ENJOY!!\n\nThe quality is really good - I just extracted the pdf from amazons azw4 file. The Azw4 file was 90mb, this pdf is 78mb.  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublisher: Garland Science; 6 edition (November 20, 2014)  \nPrint ISBN-10: 0815344325\nPrint ISBN-13: 978-0815344322\nEdition: 6\nLength: 1464 pages  \n\nAs the amount of information in biology expands dramatically, it becomes increasingly important for textbooks to distill the vast amount of scientific knowledge into concise principles and enduring concepts.As with previous editions, Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition accomplishes this goal with clear writing and beautiful illustrations. The Sixth Edition has been extensively revised and updated with the latest research in the field of cell biology, and it provides an exceptional framework for teaching and learning. The entire illustration program has been greatly enhanced.Protein structures better illustrate structureÃ¢â‚¬â€œfunction relationships, icons are simpler and more consistent within and between chapters, and micrographs have been refreshed and updated with newer, clearer, or better images. As a new feature, each chapter now contains intriguing openended questions highlighting Ã¢â‚¬Å“What We DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ introducing students to challenging areas of future research. Updated end-of-chapter problems reflect new research discussed in the text, and these problems have been expanded to all chapters by adding questions on developmental biology, tissues and stem cells, pathogens, and the immune system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:274dc500a0dce71157c83a1c911d85572db98efe","amp;dn":"Molecular+Biology+of+the+Cell+6th+edition+-+Alberts+-+NEW%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"274dc500a0dce71157c83a1c911d85572db98efe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,77,197,0,160,220,231,17,87,200,58,28,145,29,133,87,45,185,142,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
