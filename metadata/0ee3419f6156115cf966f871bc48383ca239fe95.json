Like those libraries, CinePerc was recorded at the SONY Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, and mixed by master engineer Dennis Sands. This package includes many more percussion instruments for your template. In general, these patches give you control over sounds that were more recently standardized in 20th Century music and film scores. They will expand your composing toolbox, and blend perfectly with all of the other Ã¢â‚¬Å“CineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ series libraries.\n\n=======[ Instruction ]===============================================================\n\nFor Kontakt 5.3 (and above)\n\n--- [ METHOD I ] ---\n\n- Open Kontakt 5.3 (and above)\n- Go to File tab\n- Browse for the torrent folder\n- Drag n Drop the NKI files into the Right Panel to use.\n\n--- [ METHOD II ] ---\n\n- Go to Library tab\n- Click Add Library\n- Browse for the library folder's location\n- Click Ok/Yes\n- Accept or Yes when asked\n\n=======[ Extra ]=====================================================================\n\nI DO NOT OWN THIS PRODUCT - IF YOU ENJOY IT, PLEASE CONSIDER BUYING TO SUPPORT OWNER!\n\n=======[ Greets ]====================================================================\n\nGreeting to awesome uploaders:\n\n- deepstatus\n- datsn1pah\n- imafaggot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ee3419f6156115cf966f871bc48383ca239fe95","amp;dn":"Cinesamples+-+CinePerc+PRO+%5BKONTAKT%5D+%5BISO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ee3419f6156115cf966f871bc48383ca239fe95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,227,65,159,97,86,17,92,249,102,248,113,188,72,56,60,162,57,254,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
