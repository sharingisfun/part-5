The two parts of the play -- MILLENNIUM APPROACHES and PERESTROIKA -- are separately presentable.\n\nIt was called &quot;the most thrilling American play in years&quot; by the New York Times and received numerous awards, including the 1993 and 1994 Tony Awards for Best Play.  The first part, Millennium Approaches, received the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.  A decade after its premier, Metro Weekly labeled it &quot;one of the most important pieces of theater to come out of the late 20th century.&quot;\n\nThe play was made into both a television miniseries directed by Mike Nichols (winning both the Golden Globe and Emmy for Best Miniseries) and an opera by Peter EÃƒÂ¶tvÃƒÂ¶s.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Angels in America is the broadest, deepest, most searching American play of our time.&quot; -- Jack Kroll, Newsweek\n\n&quot;A vast, miraculous play . . . provocative, witty and deeply upsetting . . . a searching and radical rethinking of American political drama.&quot; -- Frank Rich, The New York Times\n\n&quot;Playful and profound, extravagantly theatrical and deeply spiritual, witty, and compassionate, furious and incredibly smart. . . It's impossible to imagine anyone captivated by the beginning not wanting -- needing -- to go back for the end.&quot; -- Linda Winer, Newsday\n\n&quot;An enormously impressive work of the imagination and intellect, a towering example of what theatre stretched to its full potential can achieve.&quot; -- Clifford A. Ridley, Philadelphia Inquirer\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84a7825f32c0ebf05633a851cab0db60d69e5797","amp;dn":"Tony+Kushner+-+Angels+in+America%3A+A+Gay+Fantasia+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84a7825f32c0ebf05633a851cab0db60d69e5797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,167,130,95,50,192,235,240,86,51,168,81,202,176,219,96,214,158,87,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
