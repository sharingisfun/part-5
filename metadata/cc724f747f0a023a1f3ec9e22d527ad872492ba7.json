Their son Jody is 11 years old; he gets along well with his warm and affectionate pa, but his ma is haunted by the death of her other children, so she's somber, even cold. The boy wants a pet: the dad is sympathetic, the mom obdurate. When a rattler bites pa, pa kills a doe to use its organs to draw out the poison. Jody begs to keep the doe's fawn as a pet. The parents agree, and the boy and the deer are soon inseparable. The fawn grows quickly, and as a yearling tramples tobacco shoots and eats the newly-sprouted corn. This is too much for ma, and Jody has to face harsh, adult realities.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/atUf1Ts.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/atUf1Ts.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nvapAp0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nvapAp0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ba1YaNy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ba1YaNy.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZoELjgt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZoELjgt.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rAiqwT9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rAiqwT9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc724f747f0a023a1f3ec9e22d527ad872492ba7","amp;dn":"The+Yearling++%28Family+Drama+1946%29++Gregory+Peck++720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc724f747f0a023a1f3ec9e22d527ad872492ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,114,79,116,127,10,2,58,31,62,201,226,45,82,122,216,114,73,43,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
