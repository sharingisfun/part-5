By following the basics principles of animation, you can build characters that interact naturally with their environments, convey realistic emotion, and talk and walk convincingly. In this course, Dermot O' Connor shows how to design a solid character and stage and storyboard your animation before you begin. He'll examine principles like anticipation and squash and stretch, which provide characters with a sense of weight and flexibility, and show you how to animate walk cycles and dialogue. Finally, learn how to thumbnail scenes from start to finish, so you can sketch out the action before you commit to fully rendering it.\n\nThese lessons are designed with Flash in mind, but work just as well with any other 2D animation program.\nTopics include:\n\n    Creating gesture drawings\n    Comparing storyboard styles\n    Squash, stretch, and volume\n    Comparing timing and spacing\n    Using anticipation, overshoot, settle, overlap, and follow-through\n    Creating eccentric walks\n    Building stock mouth shapes for dialogue\n    Creating thumbnails\n\nSubjects:\n    3D + Animation Animation Character Animation \nSoftware:\n    Flash Professional \nAuthor:\n    Dermot O' Connor \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f78e44bef0984547eefa393fd2a59ff82a97636","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+2D+Animation+Principles+-+Transcript+Included","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f78e44bef0984547eefa393fd2a59ff82a97636","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,120,228,75,239,9,132,84,126,239,163,147,253,42,89,255,130,169,118,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
