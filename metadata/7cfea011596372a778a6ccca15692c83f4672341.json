The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Living in a typical household in an unnamed English suburb, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. \n\n\nTDespite its traditional production, the series supplants its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.\n\nThe series was occasionally the subject of controversy for some of its darker story elements, but was nevertheless the recipient of a number of awards, including the 1992 BAFTA for Best Comedy. In 2004, the series came tenth in a 2004 BBC poll to find &quot;Britain's Best Sitcom&quot;. The programme also came 80th in the British Film Institute's 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.\n\n\nSeven episodes were remade for BBC Radio 2 and the series also inspired a novel.\n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Foot_in_the_Grave&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Foot_in_the_Grave&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n \n\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\n\nAll files are ripped as Wide Screen (Except the MP3's)\n\n42 Episodes including Specials plus some Extras\n\n\n\nOne Foot In The Grave - S01 (6 Eps)\nOne Foot In The Grave - S02 (8 Eps)\nOne Foot In The Grave - S03 (6 Eps)\nOne Foot In The Grave - S04 (8 Eps)\nOne Foot In The Grave - S05 (8 Eps)\nOne Foot In The Grave - S06 (6 Eps)\n\n\n \n\nExtras\nOne Foot In The Grave - Radio Series (4 Eps)\n\n\nBritian's Best Sitcom - S01 - E06 - One Foot In The Grave\n \nI Don't Believe It! - The One Foot In The Grave Story\n\nOne Foot In The Grave - Comic Relief 1993\nOne Foot In The Grave - Comic Relief 2001 ****\n\n**** You should only watch this after the final ep\n\n\n\n\n[/b]\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : One Foot In The Grave.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 348 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 14s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 665 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 14s\nBitrate                     : 1 551 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.207\nStream size                 : 324 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 13s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 100 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 21.0 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 516 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cfea011596372a778a6ccca15692c83f4672341","amp;dn":"One+Foot+In+The+Grave+-+S01+to+06+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cfea011596372a778a6ccca15692c83f4672341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,254,160,17,89,99,114,167,120,166,204,202,21,105,44,131,244,103,35,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
