Where Puente was recording plentiful swing crossovers for RCA (&quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot; and &quot;Take the 'A' Train&quot; in addition to his early masterpiece &quot;Ran Kan Kan&quot;), his material for Tico found him keeping mostly to what his core audience in Spanish Harlem wanted to hear: plentiful hard mambos with the occasional bolero or ballad and, overall, few direct concessions to mainstream music. This was the equivalent of Duke Ellington on OKeh or Charlie Parker on Dial -- recordings for the hardcore faithful that showed a band as it existed instead of as it wanted to be sold. However, despite assumptions either way, that doesn't necessarily make this a better or worse set than the fruits of the RCA years, and indeed, for a crossover audience whose numbers usually overwhelm the core base, Puente's Tico recordings will be less familiar and even less dynamic. But the level of musicianship was high, with future heroes Mario BauzÃƒÂ¡, Mongo SantamarÃƒÂ­a, Charlie Palmieri, and Willie Bobo heard here. The Complete 78s, Vols. 1-4: 1949-1955 is a treasure trove for Latin fans.
