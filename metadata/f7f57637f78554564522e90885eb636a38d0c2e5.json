The babies have active imaginations, and often embark on adventures into imaginary worlds and perilous situations from which they are eventually returned to reality by some external event, such as Nanny coming to see what the noise was. They are constantly finding creative ways to entertain themselves and learn to work together to solve problems and survive their wild-imagined adventures.\n\nEach episode included a single storyline. Usually the babies were confronted with a child-like problem, such as fear of the dentist, or a question, such as 'where do muffins come from?' Other times, they were simply finding ways to amuse themselves with old toys or video tape equipment. The babies would then enter into their imaginations, transforming their toys into everything from time machines to pirate ships. Nearly every episode contained one song, and occasionally more than one. After the credits, the episodes would end with Animal shouting out his catchphrase 'Go bye-bye!' usually while Gonzo blasted off into the sky due to some accident he or Animal had caused.\n\nAlthough the program was a cartoon, live-action film sequences were added in unusual moments. Whenever the babies opened a door, box or book, they were often confronted with anything from a speeding train to a space ship. Foreign landscapes in their imagination were usually photos or bits of stock footage which the babies would walk across, interacting indirectly with the film's actors. Though much of the live-action came from stock footage and old black-and-white horror/monster films, more recent films such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones were also played and parodied.\n\nThe show was drawn from the babies' point of view, meaning the babies were always looking up to view the world. Objects like couches and doors were far larger than normal and more momentous obstacles for the babies. As a result of the upward view, the faces of adult characters were never shown. Nanny was only ever seen from the shoulders down as were the adults in the babies' fantasies. Exceptions were made for Uncle Statler and Uncle Waldorf and a few 'Muppet style' adults in the fantasy worlds.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muppet_babies\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086764/\n\nCreator: Jim Henson.\nWriters: Jim Henson, Jeffrey Scott, Sindy McKay, Larry Swerdlove, Hank Saroyan, J.R.

There were progressive, audio sync errors that had to be corrected using YAAI (Yet-Another-AVI-Info) and Avi-Mux Gui. This was for S1E05, S2E04, S3E13, S7E11. There was a dual static and progressive, audio sync error in S1E08, which required the previous operation and using Avi-Mux Gui's audio-delay feature. S3E06 and S7E13 were missing a left audio channel, so I used GoldWave to duplicate the right channel over. But, S7E10, was the worst of all. Worst of any file I ever corrected. Seven regressive/progressive audio sync errors. I had to chop it up into seven pieces and manually correct each error, then piece it back together. Anyway, it was worth it. No DVD exists of this television show, so these are the best versions we have. May as well do what I can to make sure the audio is good. And after six or seven full checks, every episode here has the BloodLogic seal of inspection. No (or less than 0.0001%) audio sync errors. Even then, S3E10 seems to be missing a few minutes at the beginning. If anyone finds a full version of it, upload it atand post the link! I'll up a new version of the torrent. Or, any improved episode, really.]\n\n[BLX Note 2: This torrent is dedicated to Bernard Monroe, a seventy-three year old black man, suffering from throat cancer, who was shot to death by white police officers at his own home, in March of 2009. It happened during a family barbecue, and multiple witnesses have testified that officers planted a gun on the victim. Yeah, sure, a seventy-three year old, cancer patient, at a family gathering, is going to pull a rifle on a police officer that shows up. I'm not seeing any district attorney or judge file murder charges against the officer yet. If any other person did that, they'd be counting their fingernails on the floor of the police interrogation room. But this cop is still on the streets, still preying upon the people. We can't change the past, but we need to change the future.]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Three.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f57637f78554564522e90885eb636a38d0c2e5","amp;dn":"Muppet+Babies+-+Seasons+1-7+%2B+Extras+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f57637f78554564522e90885eb636a38d0c2e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,245,118,55,247,133,84,86,69,34,233,8,133,235,99,106,56,208,194,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
