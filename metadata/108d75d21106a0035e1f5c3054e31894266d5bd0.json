You reside on Mars, sometime in the future, and when a plague spreads through the mining community, some of the Ultor employees uncover a massive conspiracy. Thus ensues a battle by a group of lowly workers, headed up by the educated Parker, to expose the deadly experiments Ultor has unleashed onto its work force.\n\nRed Faction was a very big leap forward in the FPS genre. It introduced many new technical features such as location-based damage system, real-time skeletal deformation, advanced physics simulation, destructible environment and more. The unprecedented (at the time) interaction with the environment creates a very strong feeling of immersion that is very impressive even by today's standards.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/681aae921ac0609ae5529bcc1977d2720a15f426.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/681aae921ac0609ae5529bcc1977d2720a15f426.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther:\nGenre:........................................shooter / fpp / sci-fi\nDownload size:...........................817 MB\nRelease date:.............................September 18, 2001\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................English\nDeveloper / Publisher:................Volition / Nordic Games\nGame modes:.............................single-player, multi-player\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: MATURE with Blood and Gore, Violence.
