He sifts through over 30,000 survey submissions to uncover the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favourite number, and meets a mathematician who looks for universes in his garage. He attends the World Mathematical Congress in India, and visits the engineer who designed the first roller-coaster loop.\n\nGet hooked on math as Alex delves deep into humankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turbulent relationship with numbers, and reveals how they have shaped the world we live in.\n\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster (June 10, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1451640099\nISBN-13: 978-1451640090\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n&quot;Another sparkling romp through the world of numbers, with the inimitable Alex Bellos as your friendly, informed, and crystal-clear guide.
