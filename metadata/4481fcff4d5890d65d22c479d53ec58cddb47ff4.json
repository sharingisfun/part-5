The album also features chart successes NobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Perfect and Seeing is Believing as well as a sampled cameo from Phil Collins on the riff in Black &amp; Blue.\nFor this re-release the band have re-recorded The Living Years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the song of which Mike Rutherford is most proud Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with Andrew Roachford on vocals and with backing from the South African Isango Choir.\nThe new version of The Living Years sits on a bonus 2nd CD which also includes live recordings from the original 1989 Living Years UK Tour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a great way to whet your appetite for the 25th Anniversary Tour which kicks off in February.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4481fcff4d5890d65d22c479d53ec58cddb47ff4","amp;dn":"Mike+%26amp%3B+The+Mechanics+-+Living+Years+%2825th+Anniversary+Deluxe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4481fcff4d5890d65d22c479d53ec58cddb47ff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,129,252,255,77,88,144,214,93,34,196,121,213,62,197,140,221,180,127,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
