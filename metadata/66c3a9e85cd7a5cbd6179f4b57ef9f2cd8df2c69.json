Plunging deep into midst of some of the hottest conflicts on the globe, Robert D. Kaplan takes us through mud and jungle, desert and dirt to the men and women on the ground who are leading the charge against threats to American security. These soldiers, fighting in thick Colombian jungles or on dusty Afghani plains, are the forefront of the new American foreign policy, a policy being implemented one soldier at a time. As Kaplan brings us inside their thoughts, feelings, and operations, these modern grunts provide insight and understanding into the War on Terror, bringing the war, which sometimes seems so distant, vividly to life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c3a9e85cd7a5cbd6179f4b57ef9f2cd8df2c69","amp;dn":"Imperial+Grunts+On+the+Ground+by+Robert+Kaplan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c3a9e85cd7a5cbd6179f4b57ef9f2cd8df2c69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,195,169,232,92,215,165,203,214,23,159,75,87,239,159,44,216,223,44,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
