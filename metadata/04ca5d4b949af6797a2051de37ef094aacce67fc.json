Its inhabitants are wealthy, its children's future secure. It shuns outsiders. It guards its own. And at the heart of the Prosperous lie the ruins of an ancient church, transported stone by stone from England centuries earlier by the founders of the town...\n\nBut the death of a homeless man and the disappearance of his daughter draw the haunted, lethal private investigator Charlie Parker to Prosperous. Parker is a dangerous man, driven by compassion, by rage, and by the desire for vengeance. In him the town and its protectors sense a threat graver than any they have faced in their long history, and in the comfortable, sheltered inhabitants of a small Maine town, Parker will encounter his most vicious opponents yet.\n\nCharlie Parker has been marked to die so that Prosperous may survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04ca5d4b949af6797a2051de37ef094aacce67fc","amp;dn":"John+Connolly+-+The+Wolf+In+Winter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04ca5d4b949af6797a2051de37ef094aacce67fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,202,93,75,148,154,246,121,122,32,81,222,55,239,9,74,172,206,103,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
