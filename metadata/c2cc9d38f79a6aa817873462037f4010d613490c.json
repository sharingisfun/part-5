It was their first record as a quintet. With\r\nthe arrival of multi-instrumentalist Martin McCarrick, the group recorded a multifaceted\r\nalbum with a variety of influences. Including the singles &quot;Peek-a-Boo&quot; and &quot;The Last Beat\r\nof My Heart&quot;, the record was a commercial success, peaking at No. 68 on the Billboard 200\r\nchart in the week of 3 December 1988. It spent a total of 20 weeks on that chart.\r\n\r\nPeepshow was widely acclaimed by critics. Praise centred around the unpredictability of the\r\norchestrations and new nuances in Siouxsie's voice. This album was reissued in a remastered\r\nversion with bonus tracks in October 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n1 - Peek-A-Boo [03:11]\r\n2 - The Killing Jar [04:05]\r\n3 - Scarecrow [05:06]\r\n4 - Carousel [04:26]\r\n5 - Burn-Up [04:31]\r\n6 - Ornaments of Gold [03:49]\r\n7 - Turn to Stone [04:06]\r\n8 - Rawhead and Bloodybones [02:31]\r\n9 - The Last Beat of My Heart [04:31]\r\n10 - Rhapsody [06:24]\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: Siouxsie and the Banshees\r\nGenre: Post-punk / Gothic rock / Alternative rock\r\nAlbum Release Year: 1988\r\nNumber of Tracks: 10\r\nTotal Duration: 42:44.667\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate: 782 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 L/R [Full Stereo]\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Source: Original CDs &gt; FLAC\r\nConverter: EAC V1.1 Test And Copy Secure Mode\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\r\nIncluded Artwork: [Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files]\r\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nChecksums Files: Made with Traders Little Helper\r\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheets FLAC &amp; WAV, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP,foo_dr, and M3U\r\nTotal File Size: 240 MB\r\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2cc9d38f79a6aa817873462037f4010d613490c","amp;dn":"Siouxsie+and+the+Banshees+-+Peepshow+1988+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2cc9d38f79a6aa817873462037f4010d613490c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,204,157,56,247,154,106,168,23,135,52,98,3,127,64,16,214,19,73,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
