Memories of a world filled with   :\n : freaks and clowns, with wonder and pain and anger and passion; a world with:\n : its own narrow, irrational rules, its own way of life, and its own way of  :\n : death. The world of the circus: to Jacob it was both salvation and a living:\n : hell.                                                                      :\n :                                                                            :\n : Jacob was there because his luck had run outÃ¢â‚¬â€orphaned and penniless, he had:\n : no direction until he landed on this locomotive &quot;ship of fools.&quot; It was the:\n : early part of the Great Depression, and everyone in this third-rate circus :\n : was lucky to have any job at all. Marlena, the star of the equestrian act, :\n : was there because she fell in love with the wrong man, a handsome circus   :\n : boss with a wide mean streak. And Rosie the elephant was there because she :\n : was the great gray hope, the new act that was going to be the salvation of :\n : the circus; the only problem was, Rosie didn't have an actÃ¢â‚¬â€in fact, she    :\n : couldn't even follow instructions. The bond that grew among this unlikely  :\n : trio was one of love and trust, and ultimately, it was their only hope for :\n : survival.                                                                  :\n :                                                                            :\n : Surprising, poignant, and funny, Water for Elephants is that rare novel    :\n : with a story so engrossing, one is reluctant to put it down; with          :\n : characters so engaging, they continue to live long after the last page has :\n : been turned; with a world built of wonder, a world so real, one starts to  :\n : breathe its air.                                                           :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74688073749ce791617b00044d8d2eb73b9f8c66","amp;dn":"Sara+Gruen+Water+for+Elephants+2007+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74688073749ce791617b00044d8d2eb73b9f8c66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,104,128,115,116,156,231,145,97,123,0,4,77,141,46,183,59,159,140,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
