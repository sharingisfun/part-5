After releasing a couple of albums of straight-ahead Southern boogie, the band revamped its sound to fall halfway between country-fried blues-rock and driving, arena-ready hard rock. The result was a string of hit albums and singles in the early '80s, highlighted by &quot;Caught Up in You,&quot; &quot;If I'd Been the One,&quot; &quot;Back Where You Belong,&quot; and &quot;Like No Other Night.&quot; .38 Special's popularity dipped in the late '80s as MTV-sponsored pop and heavy metal cut into their audience. Though the band had its biggest hit in 1989 with the ballad &quot;Second Chance,&quot; it proved to be their last gasp -- they faded away in the early '90s, retiring to the oldies circuit. \n\n\nGenre................: Southern Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2003\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Rockin' Into The Night\n02.Hold On Loosely\n03.Wild-Eyed Southern Boys\n04.Fantasy Girl\n05.Caught Up In You\n06.Chain Lightnin'\n07.You Keep Runnin' Away\n08.Rough-Housin'\n09.Stone Cold Believer\n10.Twentieth Century Fox\n11.If I'd Been The One\n12.Back Where You Belong\n13.Teacher, Teacher\n14.Somebody Like You\n15.Like No Other Night\n16.Back To Paradise\n17.Second Chance\n18.Take Me Back\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c921cff91cc1901ad3f2cfb47b99c1290008b8d","amp;dn":"38+Special+-+The+Very+Best+Of++%282003%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c921cff91cc1901ad3f2cfb47b99c1290008b8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,146,28,255,145,204,25,1,173,63,44,251,71,185,156,18,144,0,139,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
