This takes place upon board an alien spaceship after you beam on board. You'll have to fight the aliens and their robotic army alongside other captives, and even spacewalk. I am not sure if 1.7 is necessary. But, as all it does is add achievements, I can safely say that it probably won't require the 1.7 update.\n\nInstallation directory:\nC:Program FilesFallout 3Data\n\nRemember to activate the files via Fallout Mod Manager or the ESP/ESM selector in the Fallout 3 launcher.\n\nHave fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:498a02f20a6dedd6fd0bb78c5848018f52a11653","amp;dn":"Fallout+3+-+Mothership+Zeta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"498a02f20a6dedd6fd0bb78c5848018f52a11653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,138,2,242,10,109,237,214,253,11,183,140,88,72,1,143,82,161,22,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
