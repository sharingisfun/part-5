It is included here with embedded English subtitles, per the original PAL DVD.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\nMade in U.S.A is a 1966 French film directed by Jean-Luc Godard unofficially based on Richard Stark (aka Donald E. Westlake)&amp;#039;s novel The Jugger. This is Godard&amp;#039;s twelfth feature film. Because neither Godard nor the producer paid the book&amp;#039;s adaptation rights and following legal action by Westlake, the film has been more or less impossible to see in the United States. This film stars Anna Karina, Jean-Pierre LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©aud, LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ SzabÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ and Yves Afonso. The film is also greatly inspired by the Howard Hawks film The Big Sleep.\n\nPaula Nelson (Anna Karina), a female version of Humphrey Bogart&amp;#039;s hard boiled detectives, goes to Atlantic City to meet her lover, Richard Politzer at an unknown point in the future (maybe 1969). Once there, she learns that Richard is dead and decides to investigate his death. In her hotel room, she meets Typhus, which she ends up knocking out. His dead corpse is later to be found in the apartment of David Goodis (Yves Afonso), a writer. Paula is arrested to be interrogated because of the death of Typhys. From the on, she encounters many gangsters, who are all dead by the end of the movie. The 90 minute film has an infamously difficult to follow plot. Godard decided he would make a detective film with a deliberately incoherent narrative.\n\n__________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:465ab7b36e70b8ad4287a3cf51bbff405f3b8eb1","amp;dn":"Made+In+U.S.A.+%28Jean-Luc+Godard%2C+1966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"465ab7b36e70b8ad4287a3cf51bbff405f3b8eb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,90,183,179,110,112,184,173,66,135,163,207,81,187,255,64,95,59,142,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
