His travels have taken him into the worlds of literature, art, theater, dance, and music, about which he has recorded his observations and opinions with astuteness, dexterity, and a spirit all his own.\nHis extraordinary range of interests, his knowledge, and his inimitable style make him today one of our masters of the essay form. Reading Russell is a selection of fifty-three essays, culled from hundreds of articles and reviews","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:477ddcd937675c12293a939c6b45bdf91f781336","amp;dn":"Reading+Russell+-+Essays+1941-1988+%28Art+Philosophy+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"477ddcd937675c12293a939c6b45bdf91f781336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,125,220,217,55,103,92,18,41,58,147,156,107,69,189,249,31,120,19,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
