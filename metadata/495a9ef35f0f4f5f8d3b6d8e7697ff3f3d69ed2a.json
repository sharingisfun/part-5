Through analysis of products, political campaigns and television programs of the 1950s, Packard shows how the insidious manipulation practices that have come to dominate todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s corporate-driven world began. Featuring an introduction by Mark Crispin Miller, &quot;The Hidden Persuaders&quot; has sold over one million copies, and forever changed the way we look at the world of advertising.\n\nVance Packard (1914-1996) was an American journalist, social critic, and best-selling author. Among his other books were &quot;The Status Seekers&quot;, which described American social stratification and behavior, &quot;The Waste Makers&quot;, which criticizes planned obsolescence, and &quot;The Naked Society&quot;, about the threats to privacy posed by new technologies.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:495a9ef35f0f4f5f8d3b6d8e7697ff3f3d69ed2a","amp;dn":"The+Hidden+Persuaders+%28Vance+Packard%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"495a9ef35f0f4f5f8d3b6d8e7697ff3f3d69ed2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,90,158,243,95,15,79,95,141,59,109,142,118,151,255,63,61,105,237,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
