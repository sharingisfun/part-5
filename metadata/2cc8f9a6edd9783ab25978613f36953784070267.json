Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in a restroom in a bar. Barney is known as a womanizer.\n\nTed begins his search for his perfect mate and meets an ambitious young reporter, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as his children's &quot;Aunt Robin&quot;.\n\nTed begins dating a baker, Victoria, whom he meets at a wedding, causing Robin to become jealous and realize she does have feelings for him. Victoria moves to Germany for a dessert fellowship, and she and Ted try a long-distance relationship. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her that he has broken up with Victoria, even though he hasn't. They almost go all the way when Victoria calls and Robin answers by mistake. Ted and Victoria then break up and Robin becomes mad at Ted, but they eventually make up and decide to date.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted coming back to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring.\n\n01.Pilot 02.Purple Giraffe 03.Sweet Taste of Liberty\n04.Return of the Shirt 05.Okay Awesome 06.Slutty Pumpkin\n07.Matchmaker 08.The Duel 09.Belly Full of Turkey\n10.The Pineapple Incident 11.The Limo 12.The Wedding\n13.Drumroll, Please 14.Zip, Zip, Zip 15.Game Night\n16.Cupcake 17.Life Among the Gorillas 18.Life Among the Gorillas\n19.Mary the Paralegal 20.Best Prom Ever 21.Milk 22.Come On\n\n[Release name] How.I.Met.Your.Mother.S01.720p.hdtv.x264\n[Video.......] 1280x720, x264 @ ~4600kbps\n[Audio (ENG).] 5.1 Surround, AC3 @ 384kbps\n[Runtime.....] ~21 mins\n[File type...] Matroska Video (.mkv)\n[File size ..] 550 MiB - 700 MiB\n[Genre.......] Comedy | Romance\n[IMDB........] http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/\n[Screens.....] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7768/snapshot20091126193736.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7768/snapshot20091126193736.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img412.imageshack.us/img412/4396/snapshot20091126193703.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img412.imageshack.us/img412/4396/snapshot20091126193703.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img509.imageshack.us/img509/5325/snapshot20091126194203.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img509.imageshack.us/img509/5325/snapshot20091126194203.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cc8f9a6edd9783ab25978613f36953784070267","amp;dn":"How.I.Met.Your.Mother.Season.1.720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cc8f9a6edd9783ab25978613f36953784070267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,200,249,166,237,217,120,58,178,89,120,97,63,54,149,55,132,7,2,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
