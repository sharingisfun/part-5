Eight years later, the American people continue to live in the aftermath of 9/11 and deal with its ongoing repercussions. Is this just another machination of power on the timeline of history? If so, the real question is what happens next? Or better yet, what can we do to prevent another 9/11?\n\nThe film serves as a fundamental call to action which is fueled by hope that those affected by 9/11 will soon receive the answers that they have sought after for nearly a decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e30c80712d4973ced928963542784990a378bde","amp;dn":"Loose+Change+9%2F11%3A+An+American+Coup+++++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e30c80712d4973ced928963542784990a378bde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,48,200,7,18,212,151,60,237,146,137,99,84,39,132,153,10,55,139,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
