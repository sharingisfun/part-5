P. SELIGMAN\n2007  \nEnglish\nISBN: 1400078407 \n440 Pages\nPDF \n2.82 MB\n\n In the climate of self-improvement that pervades our culture, there is an overwhelming amount of information about treatments for everything from alcohol abuse to sexual dysfunction. Much of this information is exaggerated if not wholly inaccurate. As a result, people who try to change their own troubling conditions often experience the frustration of mixed success, success followed by a relapse, or outright failure. To address this confusion, Martin Seligman has meticulously analyzed the most authoritative scientific research on treatments for alcoholism, anxiety, weight loss, anger, depression, and a range of phobias and obsessions to discover what is the most effective way to address each condition. He frankly reports what does not work, and pinpoints the techniques and therapies that work best for each condition, discussing why they work and how you can use them to make long lasting change. Inside youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll discover the four natural healing factors for recovering from alcoholism; the vital difference between overeating and being overweight; the four therapies that work for depression, the pros and cons of anger-and much more. Wise, direct, and very useful, What You Can Change and What You CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t will help anyone who seeks to change.\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:333890094410e64521fe054d1603bbd5c0f2b7e8","amp;dn":"What+You+Can+Change+and+What+You+Can%5C%27t%3A+The+Complete+Guide+to+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"333890094410e64521fe054d1603bbd5c0f2b7e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,56,144,9,68,16,230,69,33,254,5,77,22,3,187,213,192,242,183,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
