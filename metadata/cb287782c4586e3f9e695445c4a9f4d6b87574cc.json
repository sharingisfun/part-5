Field trips to hot-air balloon events, symphony concerts, bicycle shops, and other locales make complex concepts more accessible. Inventive computer graphics illustrate abstract concepts such as time, force, and capacitance, while historical re-enactments of the studies of Newton, Leibniz, Maxwell, and others trace the evolution of theories. The Mechanical Universe helps meet different students' needs, from the basic requirements of liberal arts students to the rigorous demands of science and engineering majors. This series is also valuable for teacher professional development.\n\n\n\n\n11)  Gravity Electricity Magnetism \nForces at play in the Physics Theater. The gravitational force between two masses, the electric force between two charges, and the magnetic force between two magnetic poles -- all these forces take essentially the same mathematical form. Newton's script suggested connections between electricity and magnetism. Acting on scientific hunches, Maxwell saw the matter in an entirely new light.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1607 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 528\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (4:3)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 29.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 52\n * Part Size: 350 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mechanical_Universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mechanical_Universe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb287782c4586e3f9e695445c4a9f4d6b87574cc","amp;dn":"The+Mechanical+Universe+and+Beyond+11of52+Gravity+Electricity+Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb287782c4586e3f9e695445c4a9f4d6b87574cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,40,119,130,196,88,110,63,158,105,84,69,196,169,244,214,184,117,116,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
