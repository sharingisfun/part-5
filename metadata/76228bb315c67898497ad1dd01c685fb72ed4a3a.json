FEEL FREE TO POST SUBTITLES IN COMMENTS.\r\n\r\nAmir Escandari, Finland / Denmark / Sweden, 2014, color / black and white, DCP, 93' - \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3492436/\r\n\r\nSynopsis\r\n\r\nFour young men, all from the slums of SÃ£o Paulo, have one mission in life. Without any safety gear, they scale tall buildings to spray-paint their names and slogans criticizing society. They climb as high as they can, always clad in black. Hence, the film is mainly in black-and-white, with the occasional striking color accent. A dynamic, hand-held camera follows the boys in their daily lives, at work, on the street, at home in the favela or at night during their climbs or their raids for copper. When they are invited to the Berlin Biennale, a memorable culture clash ensues, as it appears that the curator fails to understand what lies at the heart of pixaÃ§ao, or Brazilian graffiti. Are these men artists, anarchists or criminals? On the soundtrack we hear barking dogs, sirens, speeding trains or helicopters, underlining the tension in the lives of the often-hunted pixadores. The film tells the story of these four friends â€“ Djan, William, Ricardo and Biscoito â€“ who risk their lives to leave their mark on the world. Itâ€™s a story about train surfing, fighting for freedom, realizing dreams, Nietzsche and goodness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76228bb315c67898497ad1dd01c685fb72ed4a3a","amp;dn":"Pixadores+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76228bb315c67898497ad1dd01c685fb72ed4a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,34,139,179,21,198,120,152,73,122,209,221,1,198,133,251,114,237,74,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
