The story comprises of seven different 4-issue miniseries and two bookend Specials.\n\nIndependently, each of these characters are featured in a story arc of their own that redefines their purpose in the DCU. But their stories also interweave with the other Soldiers' tales, forming a grander story of a devastating global threat to mankind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with the ties between them becoming more evident in each new volume. Together these reluctant champions must arise and somehow work together to save the world... without ever meeting one another!\n\nPack includes:\n\nSeven Soldiers 0-1\nBulleteer 1-4\nFrankenstein! 1-4\nGuardian 1-4\nKlarion the Witch-Boy 1-4\nMister Miracle 1-4\nShining Knight 1-4\nZatanna 1-4\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9857eb69e2b0b4297dc4f78de3ea5a6374640f95","amp;dn":"Seven+Soldiers+%28Grant+Morrison%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9857eb69e2b0b4297dc4f78de3ea5a6374640f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,87,235,105,226,176,180,41,125,196,247,141,227,234,90,99,116,100,15,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
