With detailed information on the NSA's secret role in the Korean Airlines disaster, Iran-Contra, the first Gulf War, and other major world events of the 80s and 90s, this is a brilliant account of the use and abuse of technological espionage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f19f92b15dcb2417c28e269d4d583975ea78df17","amp;dn":"James+Bamford+-+The+Puzzle+Palace+-+Inside+the+National+Security","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f19f92b15dcb2417c28e269d4d583975ea78df17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,159,146,177,93,203,36,23,194,142,38,157,77,88,57,117,234,120,223,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
