This new security policy prevents modifications to certain system files, folders and processes. This protects components on disk and at run-time, only allowing system binaries to be modified by the system installer and software updates.\r\n\r\nSystem Integrity Protection introduction made the algorythms, which NTFS for MacÂ® driver previously run, absolutely non-functional. Moreover all cross-platform solutions for OS X Yosemite will no longer work with OS X 10.11 El Capitan without additional fixes. To keep users happy and make this considerable security upgrade smooth and invisible, we have specifically updated Paragon's best-selling NTFS driver for OS X El Capitan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6566b6487fd4000180aadf670f7e1ac1705257b0","amp;dn":"Paragon+NTFS+14.0.332+%28Mac+OSX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6566b6487fd4000180aadf670f7e1ac1705257b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,102,182,72,127,212,0,1,128,170,223,103,15,126,26,193,112,82,87,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
