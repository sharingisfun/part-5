Rose Kennedy commiserates with and offers advice to Jackie on the burdens of marriage to a powerful man.

In the White House, the President faces increasing trouble from his Addison\\'s disease, turning to Doctor Max Jacobson for amphetamine shots.

Jack integrates the Secret Service Presidential Protective Division with the appointment of Abraham Bolden. Frank Sinatra tries to intercede with Joe on Giancana\\'s behalf; Joe rebuffs him but still cautions Bobby.

After Hoover plays Bobby a wiretap of Giancana and Johnny Roselli implicating Joe in election fraud, the brothers cut Joe out of Jack\\'s presidency.\n************\n\nPart five\n\nEscalating racial tensions in the summer of 1961 form the backdrop of episode five, which sees Jack turn to Vice-President Lyndon Johnson for help in handling the Southern Congressional delegation.

Jackie grows more dependent on amphetamines, leading Jack to confront her and Jackie to confess her fears to him. Joe suffers a massive debilitating stroke.
