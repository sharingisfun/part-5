Havoc took the role of producer, while Prodigy assumed the position of primary emcee. Originally dubbing themselves the Poetical Profits, the duo later changed its name to Mobb Deep in order to &quot;reflect their reputation on the streets.&quot;[citation needed] In the groups early career, it released the single &quot;Cop Hell.&quot;\n\nWhile members of the clique were only 17, the clique released its debut album Juvenile Hell, which was led by the single &quot;Peer Pressure.&quot; The album sold very poorly and was met with harsh reviews that wrote the duo off as just another hardcore group with little to distinguish them from the rest of the hip-hop world especially with the group Illegal despite production by DJ Premier and Large Professor. However, a few songs from Juvenile Hell gained a little recognition, such as &quot;Hit It from the Back,&quot; &quot;Locked in Spofford,&quot; and &quot;Me and My Crew.&quot; Also in 1993, Havoc had a guest appearance in the critically acclaimed Black Moon album Enta Da Stage, on a song called &quot;U Da Man.&quot;\n\nMobb Deep - Juvenile Hell (1993)\n\nJuvenile Hell is Mobb Deep's debut album released in 1993.The duo were still in its teens when the album was recorded. According to Havoc, the album sold approximately 40,000 copies during its initial release, but it remains in print to the present day.\n\nLabel: 4th &amp; B'way Records\nCatalog#: 162 444 053-2\nFormat: CD, mp3\nCountry: US\nReleased: 1993\nGenre: Hip Hop\nStyle:\nCredits: Producer - Kerwin Young (tracks: 3, 7, 11, 13) , Mobb Deep (tracks: 1, 5, 6, 8 to 11) , Paul Shabazz (tracks: 3, 7, 11, 13)\n\nScratches - Prince A.D.\nBit Rate: 128 kpbs\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.

It was released a year and a half after its previous album, The Infamous. The album is largely a continuation of the style pioneered on its previous album. The entire album was produced by Havoc, who also rhymes on the album with Prodigy. The second track, &quot;Drop a Gem on 'Em,&quot; is a response to 2Pac's feud with the group, recorded while he was still alive. The song is one of the most acclaimed in the album, along with &quot;G.O.D. Pt. III&quot; and &quot;Hell on Earth (Front Lines).&quot; Hell on Earth is considered by many die-hard fans and hip-hop heads to be the duo's best album because of its dark, hardcore tone. The album was included in Q Magazine's 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time.\nGuest appearances include Nas, Raekwon, Method Man, and frequent collaborator Big Noyd.\n\nLabel: Loud Records\nCatalog#: 1828-2\nFormat: CD, Album, Mp3\nCountry: US\nReleased: 1996\nGenre: Hip Hop\nStyle: Thug Rap\nBit Rate: 224 kbps\nCredits: Engineer [Assistant Recording And Mixing] - Ben Grassini\nExecutive Producer - Matt Life , Mobb Deep , Schott Free\nMastered By - Leon Zervos\nMixed By - Kenny Ifil* (tracks: 13) , Mario Rodriguez , Mobb Deep , Tony Smalios (tracks: 8, 9, 11)\nProducer - Mobb Deep\nRecorded By - Kenny Ifil* (tracks: 13) , Mario Rodriguez (tracks: 1 to 12, 14)\nWritten By - A.
