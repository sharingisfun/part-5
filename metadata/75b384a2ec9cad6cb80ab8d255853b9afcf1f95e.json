These three concerts became the highest grossing concerts at a single venue in history. A double album compiled from these three shows went straight to No. 1 in the UK and stayed there for a total of two weeks, selling about over 120,000 copies.[3]  Of the eight studio albums by the Red Hot Chili Peppers that were released prior to Live in Hyde Park, only three are actually represented in this album's set list - Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication and By the Way (the single &quot;Fortune Faded&quot;, however, was featured solely on the band's Greatest Hits compilation). &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; and &quot;Give It Away&quot; were the only songs from Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The songs &quot;Leverage of Space&quot; and &quot;Rolling Sly Stone&quot; are exclusive to this collection.  The song &quot;Mini-Epic (Kill For Your Country) &quot; which was performed, and originally planned for this release, did not make it into the CD versions, probably[citation needed] due to delicate issues concerning the theme of the song. However, it can be found on most video recordings displaying the concerts.  This album is now out of print, but turns up second-hand regularly[citation needed] due to high sales at the time of its release..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Intro\n[02] Can't Stop\n[03] Around The World\n[04] Scar Tissue\n[05] By The Way\n[06] Fortune Faded\n[07] I Feel Love\n[08] Otherside\n[09] Easily\n[10] Universally Speaking\n[11] Get On Top\n[12] Brandy\n[13] Don't Forget Me\n[14] Rolling Sly Stone\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:59m:43s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Throw Away Your Television\n[02] Leverage Of Space\n[03] Purple Stain\n[04] Zephyr Song\n[05] Californication\n[06] Right On Time\n[07] Parallel Universe\n[08] Drum Homage Medley\n[09] Under The Bridge\n[10] Black Cross\n[11] Flea's Trumpet Treated By John\n[12] Give It Away\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:03m:56s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 02h:03m:39s\nTotal File Size....................... 300mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
