Tahiti X includes almost the complete archipelago covering 14 islands and 9 airports with a detailed mesh and many animations.\nOf course this product should have been named French Polynesia X, but Tahiti X just sounds a lot better. But almost the complete archipelago is included covering a massive two and a half million kilometers. Distances between the islands are massive so you need an aircraft that has a reasonable cruise speed and twins are highly recommended. Of course a twin that can land on water is ideal. For example the Twin Otter we done (it even comes with a correct livery) or the default Grumman Goose. An ideal destination for a dark evening!\nFeatures:\n Island-Hopping with tropical flair\n All islands with detailed mesh\n Many animations (birds, people, dolphins)\n All airports and landing strips\n Fully documented with all charts (English manual and charts as pdf-files)\n Relatively kind on framerates\n printed Manual (English, German, French) and charts\nIslands:\n Bora Bora\n Huahine\n Maiao\n Manuae\n Maupihaa\n Maupiti\n Mehetia\n Moorea\n Motu One\n Raiatea\n Tahaa\n Tahiti\n Tetiaroa\n Tupai\nAirports:\n Faa'a, Tahiti (NTAA)\n Fare, Huahine (NTTH)\n Fetuna, Motu Nao Nao, Raiatea (NNAO)\n Maupiti, Maupiti (NTTP)\n Motu Mute, Bora Bora (NTTB)\n Temae, Moorea (NTTM)\n Tetiaroa, Tetiaroa (NTTE)\n Tupai , Tupai (NTPX)\n Uturoa, Raiatea (NTTR)\nSystem requirements:\n Microsoft Flight Simulator FSX SP2 (or Acceleration)\n Windows XP/Vista (fully updated)\n 2.0 GHz processor (Intel Core 2 Duo highly recommended)\n 2 GB RAM internal memory\n 256 MB graphic card (512 MB highly recommended)\n Installations-Size: 240 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269118fa90faf8b6dbb649b42a18c5cd46f34e8a","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Aerosoft+-+Tahiti+X+v1.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269118fa90faf8b6dbb649b42a18c5cd46f34e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,145,24,250,144,250,248,182,219,182,73,180,42,24,197,205,70,243,78,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
