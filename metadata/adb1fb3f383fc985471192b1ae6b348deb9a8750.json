The film, starring Jim Carrey and directed by MiloÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ Forman, begins at Kaufman's childhood, where he is seen performing imaginary television programs for stuffed animals. The story traces Kaufman's steps through the numerous comedy clubs, and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role as &quot;Latka Gravas&quot; on the television sitcom Taxi. The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put-ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running &quot;feud&quot; with wrestler Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton.\n\nCarrey won a Golden Globe for his performance - his second win in a row after receiving an award for The Truman Show previously. He was nominated in the Musical/Comedy category for Man on the Moon, and remarked in his acceptance speech that he thought the film was a drama at heart, an opinion shared by others, but also a reference to how Kaufman saw himself as a &quot;song and dance man.&quot;\n\nCast\n\n    * Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman/Tony Clifton\n    * Danny DeVito as George Shapiro\n    * Courtney Love as Lynne Margulies\n    * Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda/Tony Clifton\n    * Vincent Schiavelli as Maynard Smith\n    * Gerry Becker as Stanley Kaufman\n    * Jerry Lawler as himself\n    * Norm MacDonald as Michael Richards\n    * Leslie Lyles as Janice Kaufman\n    * Peter Bonerz as Ed.
