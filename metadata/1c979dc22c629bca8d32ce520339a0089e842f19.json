The focus of the narrative is split between three sets of people: the French actress Anne (Juliette Binoche), her husband and in-laws; a Romanian woman, Maria (Luminita Gheorghiu), who struggles to raise money for her family back home; and Amadou (Ona Lu Yenke), a teacher for the deaf who is at odds with his resolute African clan. The catalyst for the stories begins on a streetcorner, where Anne's brother-in-law Jean (Alexandre Hamadi) insults Maria, who is begging for change; incensed, Amadou picks a fight with Jean, resulting in negative repercussions for the triptych of protagonists. Throughout, Haneke  punctuates the action with his unique editing and use of sound.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Code Inconnu.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 747 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate : 1 516 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.224\n      Stream size : 1.19 GiB (87%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 224 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 180 MiB (13%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 96 ms (2.40 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 96 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216625/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216625/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench (and other languages) audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nFrom Secret-Cinema by dionisiou\n\nMichael Haneke - Code Inconnu (2000)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c979dc22c629bca8d32ce520339a0089e842f19","amp;dn":"Michael+Haneke+-+Code+Inconnu+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c979dc22c629bca8d32ce520339a0089e842f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,151,157,194,44,98,155,202,141,50,206,82,3,57,160,8,158,132,47,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
