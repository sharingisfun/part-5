His previous TV series on cells and DNA showed his ability to convey complex concepts in an easily accessible style, which he deploys again here.\n\n\n1)  Galen and Leonardo \nFirst in a five-part series in which Dr Adam Rutherford investigates the close relationship between discoveries in anatomy and the works of art that illustrate them. He begins by focusing on Roman anatomist Cladius Galen and artist and part-time dissector Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n2)  Andreas Vesalius \nIn 1537, the 23-year-old Andreas Vesalius became the most famous anatomist in Europe. He went on to produce the first complete account of the human body and how to dissect it, his drawings setting the gold standard for anatomical art for centuries to come and earning him the title of 'the founder of modern anatomy'. Adam Rutherford tells his story\n\n3)  Rembrandt and Ruysch \nIn the 17th century in Holland, anatomy became the cutting edge of medical science, inspiring the great artists of the age like Rembrandt to produce the most beautiful anatomical paintings yet created. Adam Rutherford travels to The Hague and Amsterdam to find out what it was that drew Rembrandt to anatomy and why dissecting bodies was thought a suitable subject for high art.\n\n4)  The Hunter Brothers \nDr Adam Rutherford investigates the story of the two brilliant but controversial Hunter brothers, who transformed both medicine and art in 18th-century Britain. Their belief that students could only learn anatomy by carrying out dissections created an unprecedented demand for dead bodies - as well as a market for the growing trade of body-snatching from graveyards.\n\n5)  Grays Anatom \nThe world's most famous study of the human body is Gray's Anatomy. The accuracy of the descriptions and the stark beauty of the illustrations made it an instant bestseller. Adam Rutherford tells the story of how, in just three years, Dr Henry Gray and Dr Henry Carter put it together based on dissections they personally performed.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;723a1b151a323e465c43&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2558 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 132 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 30mins\n * Framerate: 25FPS\n * Number of Parts: 5\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 557 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dq8j7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36f7946a0e4ead78b411556164c9e08e66352450","amp;dn":"BBC.The.Beauty.of.Anatomy.1of5.Galen.and.Leonardo.720p.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36f7946a0e4ead78b411556164c9e08e66352450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,247,148,106,14,78,173,120,180,17,85,97,100,201,224,142,102,53,36,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
