Evan, looking to hire him to find a missing dog. As a miner with a reputation for â€œbloodhoundingâ€â€”tracking down missing persons the police canâ€™t find or wonâ€™tâ€”Slim is accustomed to looking for people, not pets. On the other hand, he needs the cash to fix his air conditioner. But when he pulls the thread that leads to the Cleavesesâ€™ red-haired purebred pitbullâ€”and then the dognapper is discovered with his head blown offâ€”Slim finds himself plunged into a world of underground dogfights and white supremacists. . . all because he just wanted to get cool. \r\nAs bitingly funny as it is starkly violent, Red Dog marks the emergence of a new, gritty voice in detective fiction. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c861cfa98d57fac4ee8545c8e645807146d12c61","amp;dn":"Red+Dog+-++Jason+Miller+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c861cfa98d57fac4ee8545c8e645807146d12c61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,97,207,169,141,87,250,196,238,133,69,200,230,69,128,113,70,209,44,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
