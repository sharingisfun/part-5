But I always loved it, no matter how stupid and inane it really is. The plot holes and pure unbelievability of the film must be put aside just for the sillyness. A few things stand out. A cameo by Col. Harland Sanders of KFC, and a view of early Sea World in San Diego. When I worked there in 1985, I found all the places that the film was shot. And the best of all, is Charlie Callas' totally hilarious bit when he sees the appranently dead Sid Valentine (Lewis' other role) come to life again. He comes apart, as do his other friends, but with much more panache and skill. His stuttering, eye-popping gibberish is so funny you have to watch the same dialogue over and over again. It's a classic bit, and one that actually saves the film from being a total Lewis stinker. &quot;That's him, thats him, that's aaaahh, that's im-POSSIBLE!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7558b2b13739ca942b7c12ab621629553bada335","amp;dn":"The+Big+Mouth+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7558b2b13739ca942b7c12ab621629553bada335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,88,178,177,55,57,202,148,43,124,18,171,98,22,41,85,59,173,163,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
