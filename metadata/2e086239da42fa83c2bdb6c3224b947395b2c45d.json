Not likely. Since their debut album in 1991, Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn--two middling solo artists who turned out to be dynamite once paired together by a savvy record executive--have charted consistently with songs of various tempos and temperaments. There&amp;#039;s smooth pop (a cover of the &amp;#039;70s rock hit &quot;My Maria&quot;), hard-charging honky-tonk (&quot;Hard Workin&amp;#039; Man&quot;), thoughtful ballads (&quot;She Used to Be Mine&quot;), and the line-dancing craze&amp;#039;s very own Rosetta stone (&quot;Boot Scootin&amp;#039; Boogie&quot;). The Greatest Hits Collection gathers 16 of the duo&amp;#039;s best-known \nsongs, plus three new tracks, &quot;Honky Tonk Truth,&quot; &quot;He&amp;#039;s Got You,&quot; and &quot;Days of Thunder.&quot;\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n?
