You can make up your own mind as to \nwhether or not it is a worthwhile addition. \nIt also features all new artwork in both sections specially created for this DVD-Audio release\nThe disc will play on all DVD players, as  it is a DVD-Audio/Video &quot;hybrid&quot; containing the following:\n\nAudio_TS \nMLP Lossless at 24/96 Resolution in 4.1\n\nVideo_TS\nDTS from 24/48 Source files\nDolby Digital from 24/48 Source files\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to play both the lossy streams from DVD-Audio players.\nEach type has it&amp;#039;s own menus.
