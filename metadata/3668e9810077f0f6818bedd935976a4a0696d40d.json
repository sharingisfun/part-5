Not only does it ommit the only real album the band released in their time, but a lot of the tracks on it are either remixed or re-recorded versions of the original songs.\nI've been trying to compile a definitive &quot;ideal&quot; version of the box set for a while now, and I think this is as close as I'll ever get.\n\nThis set includes ALL the songs that were either released or prepared (= mixed) for release during the band's existence (1977-1983), plus the 3 bonus tracks from the Static Age sessions, and all the rarities that appear on the original box set, all in chronological order.\n\nAll the audio was sourced from my copy of the Box Set, except CD1 tracks 27-29 (from Static Age CD), track 30 (from Collection II), and CD3 tracks 1-13 (from Walk Among Us CD).\n\nHere's the full track list, with notes about the provenance of each track:\n\n-------------------------\n\nCD1: Static Age\n\n\n01.
