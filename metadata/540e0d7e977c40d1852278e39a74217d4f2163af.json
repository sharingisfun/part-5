It displays alright in Calibre for PC though.\nIf you have discovered an alternative epub reader that displays the text well a comment, at the bottom of the screen, would be really helpful for other downloaders, especially first time downloaders.\n\nCheers.\n\n          ---------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPhyllis BachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books have sold over eight million copies (refer wikipedia.org)\n          \n\nThe popularity of herbal medicine has exploded during the past decade, with herbal remedies becoming increasingly available in such conventional outlets as drugstores and even supermarkets. Prescription for Herbal Healing brings to herbal medicine the same in-depth, easy-to-understand information and accessible style that Prescription for Nutritional Healing successfully brought to diet and nutritional supplements. This book is divided into three parts for easy reference. Part I discusses the basic principles of herbal medicine and outlines the properties and characteristics of some one hundred sixty single herbs and sixty herbal combination formulas. Part II describes more than one hundred fifty common disorders, conveniently arranged in alphabetical order from acne to yeast infection, and names the herbal therapies that can be used in the treatment of those conditions. Part III is a guide to using various kinds of herbal and other alternative therapies. In addition, it includes self-diagnostic tests and boxed insets throughout, which offer detailed information on a wide variety of topics.\n\nComplete coverage of Chinese and Ayervedic herbs make this volume entirely comprehensive, and thorough scientific references lend it an authority not found in any other herbal book. Prescription for Herbal Healing is the definitive herbal resource and is a necessity for any health-conscious consumer.\n\n\n\nNotes: The azw3 and mobi files I checked out on a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model) using Kindle for Android, and on my desktop PC using Kindle for PC. Please refer to the top of the description regarding the epub file.\n\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:540e0d7e977c40d1852278e39a74217d4f2163af","amp;dn":"Prescription+Herbal+Healing+Balch+Bell+epub+mobi+azw3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"540e0d7e977c40d1852278e39a74217d4f2163af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,14,13,126,151,124,64,209,133,34,120,227,154,116,33,125,79,33,99,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
