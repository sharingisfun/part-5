Instead, The Hunting Party is designed as a return to rock, evoking the group's earliest records. Reconnecting with the past is a standard move for a heavy band 15 years into its career, but The Hunting Party is effectively aggressive, partially due to how far into the ether Linkin Park strayed on Living Things and, especially, A Thousand Suns. Written and recorded over the course of a year, The Hunting Party nevertheless packs a visceral punch. Hints of the murky, meditative darkness linger -- especially on &quot;Until It's Gone,&quot; which builds upon its atmosphere to reach melodramatic heights; &quot;Final Masquerade&quot; is subtler in its approach -Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but there's good reason why Page Hamilton and Tom Morello both guest on the record: this is a grinding, metallic workout. Far from sounding as if they're grasping at straws, Linkin Park seem rejuvenated, proving there is value in the clichÃƒÂ© of returning to roots.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bdc1a9e144891f5e7fad61ae0db0332a236e201","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+The+Hunting+Party+%5BHD+Tracks%5D+24.96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bdc1a9e144891f5e7fad61ae0db0332a236e201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,220,26,158,20,72,145,245,231,250,214,26,224,219,3,50,162,54,226,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
