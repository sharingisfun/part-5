He was a dancer, singer, multi-instrumentalist (vibraphone, trumpet, and drums), impressionist, comedian, convert to Judaism, and Emmy and Golden Globe-winning actor. He was a member of the 1960s Rat Pack, which was led by his old friend Frank Sinatra, and included fellow performers Dean Martin, Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford.\n\nFor much more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr.\n\nPS: The Frontcover is from another &quot;Best Of Album&quot;.\nThe Backcover is original so the tracklisting is accurate.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
