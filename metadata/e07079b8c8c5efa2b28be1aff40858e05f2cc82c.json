The Magic Faraway Tree (1943)\n3. The Folk of the Faraway Tree (1946)\n4. Up the Faraway Tree (1951) * NOT INCLUDED IN THIS COMPILATION *\n\nThe stories revolve around an enchanted wood where a gigantic magical tree, the &quot;Faraway Tree&quot;, grows. It is discovered by three children, Jo, Bessie, and Fannie, who live nearby. At the top of the tree is a ladder which leads the children to a magic land. It is a different place every time they visit, because the land can &quot;move on&quot; from the top of the tree and make way for a new land. The children are free to come and go, but they have to leave before the land &quot;moves on&quot; or they will be stuck there until the hole comes back and they can get down the ladder at the top of the tree. The Faraway Tree is inhabited by characters, especially Moonface, Silky (a fairy), The Saucepan Man, Dame Washalot, Mr. Watzisname and the Angry Pixie. The lands at the top were sometimes extremely unpleasant (the Land of Dame Slap) or sometimes fantastically enjoyable (the Land of Birthdays, the Land of Take-What-You-Want). \n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e07079b8c8c5efa2b28be1aff40858e05f2cc82c","amp;dn":"The+Faraway+Tree+Stories+-+Enid+Blyton+++%28Read+by+Kate+Winslet%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e07079b8c8c5efa2b28be1aff40858e05f2cc82c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,112,121,184,200,197,239,162,178,139,225,175,244,8,88,224,95,44,200,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
