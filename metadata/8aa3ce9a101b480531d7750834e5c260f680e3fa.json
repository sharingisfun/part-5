He was born in Newark, New Jersey, and moved to the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles when he was in the 8th grade. Tracy &quot;Ice-T&quot; Marrow's music career started with the band of the singing group, The Precious Few of Crenshaw High School. Tracy and his group opened the show, dancing to a live band. The singers were Thomas Barnes, Ronald Robinson and Lapekas Mayfield.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, he served in the United States Army for four years. He began his career as a rapper in the 1980s and was signed to Sire Records in 1987, when he released his debut album Rhyme Pays, the first hip-hop album to carry an explicit content sticker. The next year, he founded the record label Rhyme Syndicate Records (named after his collective of fellow hip-hop artists called the 'Rhyme Syndicate') and released another album, Power.\n\nHe co-founded the heavy metal band Body Count, which he introduced in his 1991 album O.G.: Original Gangster. Body Count released its self-titled debut album in 1992. Ice-T encountered controversy over his track &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, which was perceived to glamorize killing police officers. Ice-T asked to be released from his contract with Warner Bros. Records, and his next solo album, Home Invasion, was released later in February 1993 through Priority Records. Body Count's next album was released in 1994, and Ice-T released two more albums in the late 1990s. Since 2000, he has portrayed NYPD Detective Odafin Tutuola on the NBC police drama Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. \n\n\n\nRhyme Pays 1987 \n\n\nRhyme Pays is the debut album of Ice-T, released in 1987. The album, especially tracks like &quot;6 'N the Mornin',&quot; is considered to have defined the gangsta genre, and was the first hip hop album to carry a Parental Advisory warning label, although it was years before the industry-standard explicit-lyrics sticker was developed.[1] The 1988 CD release included four bonus tracks. Rhyme Pays peaked at number 93 on the Billboard 200 music chart and number 26 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums. Rolling Stone gave the album three stars. It was also the first hip-hop artist album released on the Sire and Warner Bros. labels.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Intro/Rhyme Pays&quot; \n2.\t&quot;6 'N the Mornin'&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Make It Funky&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Somebody Gotta Do It (Pimpin' Ain't Easy!!!)&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;409&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;I Love Ladies&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Sex&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Pain&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Squeeze the Trigger&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Make It Funky&quot; (12&quot; mix)\n11.\t&quot;Sex&quot; (&quot;bonus beat&quot;; instrumental)\n12.\t&quot;Somebody Gotta Do It (Pimpin' Ain't Easy!!!)&quot; (12&quot; mix)\n13.\t&quot;Our Most Requested Record&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\nPower 1988\n\n\nPower is the second album by Ice-T. Released in 1988, the album produced the single and video &quot;I'm Your Pusher,&quot; which got Ice-T major air-play on MTV. The album cover, photographed by Glen E. Friedman, was the subject of controversy upon its original release, due to the provocative pose of Darlene Ortiz, Ice-T's girlfriend at the time. &quot;I'm Your Pusher,&quot; an anti-drug song, was also interpreted as having the opposite message.[6] The album is broken down track-by-track by Ice-T in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Intro&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:11\n2.\t&quot;Power&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25\n3.\t&quot;Drama&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n4.\t&quot;Heartbeat&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n5.\t&quot;The Syndicate&quot; (feat.

Just Watch What You Say 1989\n\n\nThe Iceberg/Freedom Of Speech... Just Watch What You Say! is the third album by Ice-T. Released in 1989, the album has an uncharacteristically gritty sound, featuring some of the darkest musical scores Ice-T has ever released.\n\nThe album was released after Ice-T had been encountering censorship problems on tour. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, the rapper states that &quot;People had already told me what I could not say onstage in Columbus, Georgia. You couldn't say anything they called a 'swear' word. You couldn't touch yourself. They were using the same tactics they used on everyone from Elvis and Jim Morrison to 2 Live Crew&quot;.[5]\n\nThe album's cover, featuring a B-boy with a shotgun shoved in his mouth, and two pistols pressed against each side of his head, reflected Ice-T's experiences with the concept of freedom of speech. &quot;The concept of that picture is, 'Go ahead and say what you want. But here comes the government and here come the parents, and they are ready to destroy you when you open your mouth'&quot;.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1\t&quot;Shut Up, Be Happy&quot;\n2\t&quot;The Iceberg&quot;\n3\t&quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;\n4\t&quot;You Played Yourself&quot;\n5\t&quot;Peel Their Caps Back&quot;\n6\t&quot;The Girl Tried To Kill Me&quot;\n7\t&quot;Black 'N' Decker&quot;\n8\t&quot;Hit The Deck&quot;\n9\t&quot;This One's For Me&quot;\n10\t&quot;The Hunted Child&quot;\n11\t&quot;What Ya Wanna Do?&quot;\n12\t&quot;Freedom Of Speech&quot;\n13\t&quot;My Word Is Bond&quot;\n\t\n\n\n\n\nO.G. Original Gangsta 1991\n\n\nO.G. Original Gangster is the fourth album by Ice-T. Released in 1991, the album has been praised by many as the artist's best. The album introduces the band Body Count, whose thrash metal sound is in sharp contrast to the rest of the album's material. The whole album has also been made into a video. O.G. Original Gangster has been seen as Ice T's best record, and has over the years has been seen as a classic west coast record. The album's most prominent tracks were featured in the film New Jack City.\n\nO.G. Original Gangster peaked at #9 on Billboard magazine's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and at #15 on the Billboard 200.[8] The album was ranked at #25 in Melody Maker's list of the top 30 albums of 1991,[9] and was featured in The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums [10] and the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.  Allmusic - 5 stars - &quot;A sprawling masterpiece that stands far and away as Ice-T's finest hour.&quot; Rolling Stone (6/13/91) - 4 stars - Excellent - &quot;Ice-T has forged a flexible, hyperliterate style that sacrifices none of hip-hop's rhythmic momentum... his slice-of-street-life stories and badass parables offer a fascinating glimpse into a half-hidden world.&quot; Melody Maker (12/91) - &quot;Tight, intelligent and matchless musically.&quot;\n\nTracks: \n\n1\t&quot;Home of the Bodybag&quot;\n2\t&quot;First Impression&quot;\n3\t&quot;Ziplock&quot;\n4\t&quot;Mic Contract&quot;\n5\t&quot;Mind over Matter&quot;\n6\t&quot;New Jack Hustler&quot;\n7\t&quot;Ed&quot;\n8\t&quot;Bitches 2&quot;\n9\t&quot;Straight up Nigga&quot;\n10\t&quot;O.G.

Released in 1993, the album (which was originally set to be released in 1992 as part of his deal with Sire/Warner Bros. Records) was Ice-T's first official release as an artist on his own label Rhyme Syndicate Records, now in full control of the content of the release, as part of his new distribution deal with Priority Records.\n\nHome Invasion was the first album that Ice-T released following the controversy over the Body Count song &quot;Cop Killer.&quot; Sire/Warner Bros. Records had stood by freedom of expression during the controversy, although some within the Time Warner conglomerate now favored a more pragmatic policy. Home Invasion was originally set for a November 15, 1992, release, but the Rodney King riots were still fresh in people's minds, an election was in process, and political releases by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre were causing controversy, so Ice T agreed to postpone Home Invasion's release, in addition to removing the song &quot;Ricochet,&quot; which had already appeared on the soundtrack to the film of the same name.\n\nWith the album's release postponed to February 14, 1993, Sire/Warner Bros. told Ice-T that it would not release the album with its current artwork, painted by Dave Halili (cover artist for Body Count), which depicted a white child who is seemingly engrossed in black culture surrounded by images of violence, mayhem and disorder. Although the catalog number 45119 was already assigned to it and the single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gotta Lotta LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released, the album was still deferred. Ice-T initially agreed, opting for an all-black cover and a name change to The Black Album. He later realized that his future output was going to be continuously monitored and censored, so he left the label amicably, signing a distribution deal with Priority Records, which released the album with the originally intended artwork.[1] Due to the postponed release of the album, tracks were altered to keep the topics up-to-date.\n\nIn 2004 Jay-Z released a song called 99 Problems using the same title and chorus as the Home Invasion track.\n\nThe album peaked at #9 on Billboard magazine's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and at #14 on the Billboard 200.[6] Home Invasion was the last hip hop release of Ice T that had significant political content. His later releases were more in tune with the rest of gangsta rap. This is reflected in how this album featured the end of the accumulated pleas that had appeared inside the pamphlets of his albums since Power. Home Invasion is also often seen as the release with which Ice T's career began to take a downturn. Reviews were generally less impressed than they had been with his earlier work. The hip hop audience was moving away from political artists at the time. The rivalry between the West and East Coast was also at its peak. Ice-T had always stayed out of the dispute. He also didn't seem to fit neatly into either camp; he hailed from the West Coast, but his raps were more in the style of the East Coast.\n\nTracks: \n\n1\t&quot;Warning (Intro)&quot;\n2\t&quot;It's On&quot;\n3\t&quot;Ice M.F.
