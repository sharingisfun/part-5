I'm not the only one that has concluded that the darker, deeper themes of the album were betrayed with less than stellar lyrics &amp; excessive production. \n\nIt pains me to say that NLOTH is one of U2's weakest albums. That's not to say it's a terrible album, for even U2's weakest albums still remain considerably better than most artists' best. But it could have been better. And so this pet project was born to bring NLOTH into... a new light. To rediscover and fine tune an album that is more thematically whole and features a more sonically cohesive &amp; satisfactory play order.\n\nI've substituted in place of the excised tracks* songs that I felt would work better among this collection. Those include: Mercy (recorded in the previous album sessions but not used) and Winter (from the NLOTH sessions &amp; the 'Brothers' OST), as well as Breathe (Mandela Version from the 'Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom' OST) and Soon (a single found only with the 'U2 360Ã‚Â° at the Rose Bowl' Super Deluxe boxset). This new, stripped down version of Breathe fits better with the slower, more somber songs on the back end of this album.\n\nOf further note, the track 'Fez - Being Born' has been shaved of its Eno-esque prologue, allowing the raw power of the song to just thrust the listener into the album after the first track. Moment of Surrender has been moved to conclude the album, mirroring the set closer of the tour.\n\nThe themes of birth and rebirth, struggle and salvation should now prove easier to discern &amp; appreciate. \n\nLastly, the album cover was redone because the sea scape featured on NLOTH by Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto was already used by another artist. It took away from U2's 'uniqueness'. I thus made a cover that I felt was more fitting with a photograph of the band, looking out on a beach. \n\nI hope this alternate version allows you to appreciate the original in a new light. There's great work to be found, but I felt it needed the distractions peeled away to get there. \n\nHope you enjoy NLOTH Revisited and, *please*, send your thoughts to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;185654574c504a7d6e716b716c7d7c5875797174367b7775&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n        \n                 U2 - No Line On The Horizon REVISITED\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------- \n   1.
