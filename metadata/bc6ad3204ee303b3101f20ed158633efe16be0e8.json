It's the year 1921, and renowned English explorer William Pike leads an expedition into the dense jungles of Peru in search of the fabled &quot;Lost Temple of the Incas,&quot; an elusive sanctuary said to have strange healing properties. Can it be that these two disparate souls, separated by thousands of years and hundreds of millions of miles, will somehow fall in love?\n\nRelease Note: This issue was printed in an intentionally unorthodox format, with all of the pages that were focused on the male protagonist flipped upside down, while pages focused on the female protagonist were right side up. This release preserves the format as it was printed.\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
