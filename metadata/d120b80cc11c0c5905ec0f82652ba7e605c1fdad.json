You'll learn how to maintain, secure, troubleshoot, install, control and configure basic network infrastructure. This series offers the perfect way to kick off your network admin career or improve on the networking skills you already have. It's also a terrific introduction to computer networking for business professionals of any stripe. \n\nThis exciting series begins by providing you a solid foundation of how computer networks operate, and builds upon that knowledge with real-world examples of network technologies and protocols including the OSI model, TCP/IP, DNS, ARP, IP addressing (including sub-netting), and media types and connectors including fiber optics, copper and wireless.\n\nKeith uses real-world experience and analogies to explain complex topics in simple, easy-to-digest, bite-sized chunks, and makes it fun. In addition to live demonstrations as examples of the technologies taught in the videos, Keith includes protocol analyses (where Keith uses a protocol analyzer to show the details of what is really happening on the network) to reinforce the concepts and ideas learned in the videos. The new Network+ video series covers each and every topic in the latest blueprint for the 2011 N10-005 exam, and each Nugget maps to a specific exam objective. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nThis is 2013 content, directly from CBT Nuggets.  It is a fantastic series and will prepare you very well for the N10-005 Network+ exam.\n\nLet me know if there are any issues with any of the videos in the comments and I will see what I can do.  This is the first dump.  More 2013 CBT Nuggets content coming soon.  Stay tuned.\n\n\n\nSupport the freedom of information.  Seed. Share. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d120b80cc11c0c5905ec0f82652ba7e605c1fdad","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+-+CompTIA+Network%2B+N10-005+Video+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d120b80cc11c0c5905ec0f82652ba7e605c1fdad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,32,184,12,193,28,12,89,5,236,15,130,101,43,167,230,5,193,253,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
