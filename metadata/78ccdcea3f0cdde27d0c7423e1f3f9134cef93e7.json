Each .map contains the \nrelevant datum and projection.\n\n\nFORMAT\n\n.ozf2 &amp; .map\n\nI choose the ozf2 format as it produces \nhigh quality images at a fairly small file \nsize, and it's fairly compatible with \nvarious map conversion softwares. The \nactual OZI Explorer software is also \nreadily available.\n\nIf you would like to see these in another\nformat I can possibly convert them from \nthe master files and make them available, \njust let me know.\n\n\nCREDIT\n\nAll credit goes to Hema for producing these\nabsolutely outstanding maps. If you enjoy\nusing these maps please buy something from\nHema to let them know you care!\n\nThe main reason I converted these maps was \nbecause Hema's iOS app leaves a little to\nbe desired (it's basically a port of\nMemory Map) and they have not made their\nrecent maps available (for purchase) in any \nother digital format.\n\n\nYOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TOO\n\nI am looking for the following maps and \nwould be happy to share them if you'd like\nto send me a disc or upload them somewhere.\n\n- Greg Harewood 100k South West WA\n- Greg Harewood 100k West Coast WA\n- Greg Harewood 50k Pilbara WA\n- Greg Harewood 50k Kimberley WA\n- NSW TopoView Raster 2006\n- VIC, QLD, SA, WA 25K Topo maps (any editions)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78ccdcea3f0cdde27d0c7423e1f3f9134cef93e7","amp;dn":"HEMA.2012.Austalia.OZIEXPLORER-mapPirate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78ccdcea3f0cdde27d0c7423e1f3f9134cef93e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,204,220,234,63,12,221,226,125,12,116,35,225,243,249,19,76,239,147,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
