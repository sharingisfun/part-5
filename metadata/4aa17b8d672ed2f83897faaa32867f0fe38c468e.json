Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mali MusicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2002) is a brilliant, eclectic treat comprised of truly mesmerizing sounds.\n\nAlbarn traveled throughout Mali and recorded the source material at various venues, from small bars to village streets. He then brought the recordings into a professional studio, adding guitars, keyboards, percussion, and effects to a majority of the tracks, and the result is a thoroughly chilled album. Layered and rich musical tones emerge from pianos, samplers, xylophones, and chanting choirs. Beats and keyboards mingle effortlessly with the exotic instruments.\n\nPrimary Mali players include guitarists Afel Bocoum and Lobi Traore, kora player Toumani DiabatÃƒÂ©, and ngoni player Ko Kan Ko Sata Doumbia.\n\nInspiring, uplifting music.\n\n\n \nAfel Bocoum, Damon Albarn, Toumani DiabatÃƒÂ© &amp; Friends\n\nMali Music\n\n2002\n\n\n\n  CD / 2002 / 320Kbps\n\n \n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
