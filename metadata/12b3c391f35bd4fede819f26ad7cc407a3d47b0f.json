Unlike groups like Level 42 or Spandau Ballet, they actually had more catchy songs outside of their big hit, despite how it might have seemed to the rest of the world. The sound displayed here is so mired in the decade it comes from that it might turn off many, but T'Pau was the natural extension of ABBA's perfect pop once faced with the changes new wave and synth pop brought to the music industry. This album may be filled with overblown fluff, but it is some of the best overblown fluff from a decade full of it. There are countless hidden gems to be found here, and fans of '80s pop may find themselves shocked as to how good the band really is outside of &quot;Heart and Soul,&quot; one of the most precious, gorgeous songs to emerge out of the time period. That is one song that has aged remarkably well, featuring some great post-Kate Bush vocal tricks and the best driving synth line of 1987 (although New Order is exempt from that comment). A true hidden gem, this is by far the best document of music someone could get from this band, even with the eerie cover photo and shoddy packaging.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] China In Your Hand\n[02] Heart And Soul\n[03] Valentine\n[04] Only A Heartbeat\n[05] Whenever You Need Me\n[06] Secret Garden\n[07] Sex Talk\n[08] Road To Our Dream\n[09] This Girl\n[10] Only The Lonely\n[11] Bridge Of Spies\n[12] I Will Be With You\n[13] No Sense Of Pride\n[14] Strange Place\n[15] Hold On To Love\n[16] The Promise\n[17] A Place In My Heart\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:12m:31s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 173mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
