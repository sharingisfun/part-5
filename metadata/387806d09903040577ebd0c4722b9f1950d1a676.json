It includes songs from Zephyr, The James Gang, Billy Cobham, Alphonse Mouzon, Moxy, Deep Purple, and Tommy&amp;#039;s two Solo Ablums (Teaser and Private Eyes). There is also a previously unreleased accoustic version of &quot;People, People&quot; (called &quot;Brother, Brother&quot;) that sets the stage for later releases of archived tapes. A wonderful biographical picture booklet accompanies this 2CD box set, which is heavily laden with trivia to bring back even the most ardent fan again and again to check over the facts and timelines. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Bolin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Bolin&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOriginal Release Date: September 25, 1989\nNumber of Discs: 2 \nNumber of Tracks: 23 \nTT: 1:49:28\n\nTrack Listing:\nCD1\n01.
