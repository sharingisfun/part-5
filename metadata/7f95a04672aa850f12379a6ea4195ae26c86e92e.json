The murders in London between 1888-91 attributed to Jack the Ripper constitute one of the most mysterious unsolved criminal cases. This story is the result of many years meticulous research. The author reassesses all the evidence and challenges everything we thought we knew about the Victorian serial killer and the vanished East End he terrorized. Based on exhaustive research by a trained historian, the definitive work on the Ripper murders includes much new material, the discovery of a possible new victim, details of victims' lives, and exoneration of several traditional suspects.\n\nHardcover: 532 pages\nPublisher: Carroll &amp; Graf Pub; First edition (November 1994)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0786701242\nISBN-13: 978-0786701247","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f95a04672aa850f12379a6ea4195ae26c86e92e","amp;dn":"The+Complete+History+Of+Jack+The+Ripper+By+Philip+Sugden+%28Epub%2CM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f95a04672aa850f12379a6ea4195ae26c86e92e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,149,160,70,114,170,133,15,18,55,154,110,164,25,90,226,108,134,233,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
