Some 28 years after its initial recording and release, Skylarking finally appears on CD as it was originally intended to sound. Andy Partridge - never entirely happy with the overall sound of the finished album - took it to award-winning mastering engineer John Dent, who noticed something that had never previously been spotted. Somewhere, possibly in the transfer from the multi-channel tape to the stereo master, a polarity had been reversed. This is not the same thing as a reversed left/right channel which puts a stereo picture out of phase and makes the sound unlistenable, but a much more difficult to pin down event that can be triggered by something as simple as a badly wired plug in the overall system which, nonetheless, removes some of the punch and presence from a finished recording. The album's cover and tracklisting have reverted to the band's original vision, making this the ultimate edition of one of the band's most popular albums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a7dd4f905d379ebc31115fca81d11e511d5293f","amp;dn":"XTC+-+Skylarking+%28Corrected+Polarity+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a7dd4f905d379ebc31115fca81d11e511d5293f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,125,212,249,5,211,121,235,195,17,21,252,168,29,17,229,17,213,41,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
