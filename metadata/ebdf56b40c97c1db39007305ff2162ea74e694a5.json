Michael Hampton\n\n\nCourse Description:\n\nThis is the second Analytical Figure Drawing class offered through CGMA. As such, this course builds on the skills and information covered in the initial course, however challenges students to push those skills through the introduction of additional subject matter. In addition to covering parts not addressed in the first course (hands, feet, features, and drapery) this course will answer the basic question of &quot;what to do with the figure?&quot; This question will be put to the student through lectures on the execution/ use of tone and composition specifically. \n\n\nsite: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://2d.cgmasteracademy.com/analytical-figure-drawing-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://2d.cgmasteracademy.com/analytical-figure-drawing-2.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nfiles originally shared by: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.f4e.info/showthread.php?p=9757626&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.f4e.info/showthread.php?p=9757626&lt;/a&gt;\n\nplease support the creators!\n\ncheers.\nonlydark","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebdf56b40c97c1db39007305ff2162ea74e694a5","amp;dn":"CGMW-+Analytical+Figure+Drawing+-Michael+Hampton+pt2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebdf56b40c97c1db39007305ff2162ea74e694a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,223,86,180,12,151,193,219,57,0,115,5,255,33,98,234,116,230,148,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
