The growing excitement about WebGL applications and their ability to integrate HTML5, inspired the authors to exclusively use WebGL in the Seventh Edition of Interactive Computer Graphics with WebGL. Thisis the only introduction to computer graphics text for undergraduates that fully integrates WebGL and emphasizes application-based programming. The top-down, programming-oriented approach allows for coverage of engaging 3D material early in the course so students immediately begin to create their own 3D graphics.\n\nTeaching and Learning Experience\nThis program will provide a better teaching and learning experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€œfor you and your students. It will help:\n\nEngage Students Immediately with 3D Material: A top-down, programming-oriented approach allows for coverage of engaging 3D material early in the course so students immediately begin to create their own graphics.\nIntroduce Computer Graphics Programming with WebGL and JavaScript: WebGL is not only fully shader-basedÃ¢â‚¬â€œeach application must provide at least a vertex shader and a fragment shaderÃ¢â‚¬â€œbut also a version that works within the latest web browsers.\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1 Graphics Systems And Models\nChapter 2 Graphics Programming\nChapter 3 Interaction And Animation\nChapter 4 Geometric Objects And Transformations\nChapter 5 Viewing\nChapter 6 Lighting And Shading\nChapter 7 Discrete Techniques\nChapter 8 From Geometry To Pixels\nChapter 9 Modeling And Hierarchy\nChapter 10 Procedural Methods\nChapter 11 Curves And Surfaces\nChapter 12 Advanced Rendering\nAppendix A: Initializing Shaders\nAppendix B: Spaces\nAppendix C: Matrices\nAppendix D: Sampling And Aliasing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c862b42ed9e218ecb2efbb9c3b3f02efe1df88","amp;dn":"Interactive+Computer+Graphics%3AA+Top+Down+Approach+with+WebGL%5BX7%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c862b42ed9e218ecb2efbb9c3b3f02efe1df88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,200,98,180,46,217,226,24,236,178,239,187,156,59,63,2,239,225,223,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
