I agree with many of the points, but wanted to add my humble opinion. If you're a big fan of the Clash (as I am), then you have all of these songs already. Likewise, fans of the Clash probably don't even like the concept of a 'greatest hits' CD...why bother when they released such great albums??!!!\nHowever, even though the Clash are 'the only band that matter' to their fans, there are many music fans (some with good taste!) who likely are not hard-core Clash collectors. For people who want a taste of The Clash and their punk, this CD is pretty good. It covers their biggest US hits (Train in Vain, Rock the Casbah, Should I Stay?) and their biggest UK hits (London Calling, Bankrobber, &amp; Tommy Gun - all hit the UK Top 20). Part of the appeal of the Clash is that they kept trying to expand themselves, which can clearly be seen in this CD.\n\nWith the sad and recent passing of Joe Strummer, fans of the Clash should do all they can to make sure that their music can reach as many people as possible...that's the purpose of a 'greatest hits' CD. In those terms, I think that this CD suceeds, and it will appeal to casual fans.\n\nOf course, with their upcoming induction into the R&amp;R Hall of Fame, many people will like be paying attention to the Clash's back catalogue. If you're curious, start with their 1977 debut or &quot;London Calling,&quot; both are pretty brilliant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2280332758c6d585b77e97f5256aa1e5fd846991","amp;dn":"The+Clash+-+The+Singles+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2280332758c6d585b77e97f5256aa1e5fd846991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,128,51,39,88,198,213,133,183,126,151,245,37,106,161,229,253,132,105,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
