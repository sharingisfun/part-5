Charles Hertan?s radically different approach is: use COMPUTER EYES and always look for the most forcing move first! By studying forcing sequences according to Hertan?s method you will develop analytical precision, improve your tactical vision, overcome human bias and staleness, and enjoy the calculation of difficult positions. By recognizing moves that matter, you will win more games!\n\nCONTENTS\nCh.1: Stock Forcing Moves\nCh.2: Stock Mating Attacks\nCh.3: Brute Force Combinations\nCh.4: Surprise Forcing Moves\nCh.5: Equal or Stronger Threats\nCh.6: Quiet Forcing Moves\nCh.7: Forcing Retreats\nCh.8: Zwischenzugs\nCh.9: Defensive Forcing Moves\nCh.10: Endgame Forcing Moves\nCh.11: Intuition and Creativity\nCh.12: Various Exercises","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7df193c23bea662f86ec689692d522ebbf8548b","amp;dn":"Forcing+Chess+Moves+%283rd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7df193c23bea662f86ec689692d522ebbf8548b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,223,25,60,35,190,166,98,248,110,198,137,105,45,82,46,187,248,84,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
