The band consists of vocalist Gavin Hayes, guitarist Mark Engles, bassist Drew Roulette and drummer Dino Campanella. With Hayes and Roulette enjoying art as a hobby, the band has consistently incorporated art, and painting in particular, into their albums and concerts.\n\nThe band established themselves in the indie scene with their 1998 release of the concept album Leitmotif, landing them a deal with Interscope Records. Dredg released El Cielo in 2002 and in 2005 released the album Catch Without Arms. The band is most often associated with progressive and art rock.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  dredg       \nAlbum     -  various                                          \nGenre     -  progressive/alternative                                             \nLabel     -  Interscope, Universal\nYear      -  1994 - present                                            \nTracks    -  n/a                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  354.28 MB\nkbps      -  VBR / 256 avg.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy.
