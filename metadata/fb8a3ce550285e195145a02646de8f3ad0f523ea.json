Finally putting the last vestiges of Flat Eric behind him, 'Moustache (Half A Scissor)' sees Oizo embarking on a musical ramble that is a crackling union of his old, minimal sound and the type of fractured escapades that emerged on his mate Jackson's 'Smash' album (that just happens to also be released this week!). Opening with a bit of robot ire, Oizo hits his stride proper on the breaks-meets-80's-pop-meets-Arthur Baker-meets-AFX 'The End' before collapsing in a heap of brooding synth action on the bouncing rhythms of 'Latex'. Elsewhere he gets handy with some Prefuse shennanigans on 'Berleef', uncorks some glitchy, Acid stained filterhouse on the title track, before blowing the speakers with the static honed f*ck-wittery of '1$44'. Pretty sensory baiting if devoured in one sitting, 'Moustache (Half Scissor)' is nonetheless a worthy sucessor to 'Analog Worms Attack'. Now go buy some jeans...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb8a3ce550285e195145a02646de8f3ad0f523ea","amp;dn":"Mr+Oizo+-+Moustache+-+2005+%28Advanced+Promo+CDR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb8a3ce550285e195145a02646de8f3ad0f523ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,138,60,229,80,40,94,25,81,69,160,38,70,222,143,58,208,245,35,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
