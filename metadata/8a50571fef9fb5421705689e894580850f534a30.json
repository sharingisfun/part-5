The band takes its name from the Sindarin name of Mount Doom, a volcano in J. R. R. Tolkienâ€²s Middle-earth. Their lyrics mostly deal with Vikings, their mythology and their history, leading to the band often being labeled as Viking metal. The band is composed of vocalist Johan Hegg, guitarists Olavi Mikkonen and Johan SÃ¶derberg and bassist Ted LundstrÃ¶m. Amon Amarth has released nine studio albums, one compilation album, one EP, one video album, and eight music videos.\r\nTheir first studio album, Once Sent from the Golden Hall, debuted in 1998. Four more studio releases followed, before the band saw their breakthrough with the 2008 album Twilight of the Thunder God, which debuted at No. 11 on the Swedish album charts and No. 50 on the US Billboard 200. Two more albums, Surtur Rising and Deceiver of the Gods followed in 2011 and 2013, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nYear: 2016\r\nStyle: Melodic Death Metal\r\nCountry: Sweden\r\nFormat: 320 mp3\r\nSize: 119.77 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded: 22/03/2016 09:02:54\r\nFiles: 12\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nLength :00:52:08\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n01.
