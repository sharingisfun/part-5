The alpha male syndrome is in full force and the female sex cannot get enough.\n\nAnd itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all about being tall with huge muscles. Look at Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible. Hardly a towering figure, but still the ladies go mad for him.\n\nThe alpha male comes from within and with the help of Carlos XumaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Alpha Rules box set you too can unleash your dominant side and have girls literally queuing up to be with you.\n\nI can understand if you are a little skeptical already. I certainly was. But now thanks to XumaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind-blowing system, I have come to realize that there is an inner masculine power in all of us and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just about knowing how to bring it out.\n\nBeing an alpha male doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just start and end at being able to pick up women. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about being dominant in every area of your life, whether work or social. Think about the guy in the office that has a certain something about him. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s confident in meetings, everyone seems to connect with him and of course, the ladies love him.\n\nHow do you think he behaves outside of work? Well, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly the same! The reason being is once the alpha male within has been released, it becomes second nature. In every scenario the alpha male commands respect and after learning techniques from XumaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s box set, within weeks, this WILL be you.\n\nThe program will help you develop a mindset of unstoppable confidence that will eliminate any feelings of fear or anxiety. Just think how fantastic it would be heading to your next interview or approaching a new girl knowing that you are going to wow them, making rejection a thing of the past.\n\nYou will learn a whole array of specific tactics and techniques for winning in any social or work related setting. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe how powerful some of these really are.\n\nWouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it be nice to date a beautiful woman and not feel all insecure and needy? LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s be honest, it happens to all of us. You know every guy wants to be with her, so you start to doubt why she would want to be with you. Learn some never seen before techniques that will have you in the power seat with any beautiful woman and everything will be on your terms rather than hers.\n\nThe series is produced in a very easy to follow module and although the information provided is of the highest calibre, there is a little room for a more jovial side. You will learn how the Ã¢â‚¬Å“fun testÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ works and if you pass it, how youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re likely to end up in bed with any woman of your choice. Women react to a guyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cheeky side, but go overboard and you could be heading for disaster!\n\nLearn the real truth about Ã¢â‚¬Å“negsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the cocky approach and why these methods backfire in most cases Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially with high status females.\n\nIf you are frustrated being the shy, unnoticed guy and want to learn how to feel and project extreme confidence, the Carlos XumaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Alpha Rules box set is an essential piece of kit to turn that dream into a reality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8567f3df8fa26fec13db9721269c5195344c618","amp;dn":"Carlos-Xuma-Alpha-Rules.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8567f3df8fa26fec13db9721269c5195344c618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,86,127,61,248,250,38,254,193,61,185,114,18,105,197,25,83,68,198,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
