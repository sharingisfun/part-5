It is set at the annual ball of a small town's volunteer fire department, and the plot consists of a collection of anecdotes told within that setting. The film uses no actors - the firemen portrayed are the firemen of the small town where it is set.[citation needed]\n\nThe Fireman's Ball was the last film Forman would make in his native Czechoslovakia. It is also the first film he shot in color, and a milestone of the Czech New Wave.\n\n---=Rip Info=------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\tVideo: 647 MB (92.53%)\n\tAudio: 45.5 MB (6.52%)\n\tAVI Overhead: 6.67 MB (0.95%)\n\t\n\t---=Audio=-------------------------------------\n\t0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n\t48000Hz  86 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo\n\tInterleave: 1 vid frame (33 ms), preload=504\n\t\n\t---=Video=-------------------------------------\n\t656 x 496 @ 23.976 fps, XviD\n\t1:13:54, 106,296 frames\n\tQf 0.157/1224 kbps\n\n\t---=Size=--------------------------------------\n\t733,652,992 bytes (106,296 frames)\n\n\t---=Subtitles=---------------------------------\n\tEnglish SUB/IDX\n\t\t\n\t---=Credits=-----------------------------------\n\tThanks to Tansir and friends at DVD World\n\tRip by -=:ZEiNAB:=-\n\t\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
