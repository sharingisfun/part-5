He was also the rare athleteof his day who was photographed equally inside and outside of the ring, and always, the images were striking and compelling.\r\n\r\nNow, in an all-new special edition, LIFE celebrates the legendary athlete and cultural icon in Ali: A Life in Pictures, featuring dozens of photographs from acclaimed photographers including Gordon Parks, Harry Benson, Marvin Lichtner, James Drake, The Bettman Archive and many more. Many of these images have come to be as synonymous with Ali as his best quotes, and many of these images have not been seen for years.\r\n\r\nAll of the photos are accompanied by essays and commentary that take readers through four distinct stages of Aliâ€™s life â€“ â€œClay,â€ â€œAli,â€ â€œLegend,â€ and â€œThe Greatest,â€ and all together, Ali: A Life in Pictures is the ultimate commemorative keepsake that celebrates an icon in both words and photographs.Please note that this product is an authorized edition published by Time Inc. and sold by Amazon.
