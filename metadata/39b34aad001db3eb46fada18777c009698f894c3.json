Led \nZeppelin had mystique. They rarely gave interviews, \nsince the music press detested the band. Consequently, \nthe only connection the audience had with the band was \nthrough the records and the concerts. More than any other \nband, Led Zeppelin established the concept of album-oriented \nrock, refusing to release popular songs from their albums as \nsingles. In doing so, they established the dominant format \nfor heavy metal, as well as the genre's actual sound. allmusic......\n\nThe Complete Studio Recordings - 1993 Box Set Remastered\n\n1969 - Led Zeppelin\n1969 - Led Zeppelin II\n1970 - Led Zeppelin III\n1971 - Led Zeppelin IV\n1973 - Houses of the Holy\n1975 - Physical Graffiti\n1976 - Presence\n1979 - In Through the Out Door\n1982 - Coda\n\n\nEncoder..............FLAC\nAudio Quality........Lossless\nContains.............Album Art, CRC, ID Tag\nSample Rate..........44.1KHz\nSample Size..........16 bit\nBit Rate.............1411kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b34aad001db3eb46fada18777c009698f894c3","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+The+Complete+Studio+Recordings+-+1993+Box+Set+Rem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b34aad001db3eb46fada18777c009698f894c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,179,74,173,0,29,179,235,70,250,218,24,119,124,0,150,152,248,148,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
