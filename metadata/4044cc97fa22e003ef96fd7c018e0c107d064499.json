Beolab. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecorded quickly during Led Zeppelin's first American tours, Led Zeppelin II provided the blueprint for all the heavy metal bands that followed it. Since the group could only enter the studio for brief amounts of time, most of the songs that compose II are reworked blues and rock &amp; roll standards that the band was performing on-stage at the time. Not only did the short amount of time result in a lack of original material, it made the sound more direct. Jimmy Page still provided layers of guitar overdubs, but the overall sound of the album is heavy and hard, brutal and direct. &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; &quot;The Lemon Song,&quot; and &quot;Bring It on Home&quot; are all based on classic blues songs -- only, the riffs are simpler and louder and each song has an extended section for instrumental solos. Of the remaining six songs, two sport light acoustic touches (&quot;Thank You,&quot; &quot;Ramble On&quot;), but the other four are straight-ahead heavy rock that follows the formula of the revamped blues songs. While Led Zeppelin II doesn't have the eclecticism of the group's debut, it's arguably more influential. After all, nearly every one of the hundreds of Zeppelin imitators used this record, with its lack of dynamics and its pummeling riffs, as a blueprint. \n\nAs well as a single CD remaster (in a gatefold sleeve with an eight-page booklet) there is a deluxe 2CD version of Led Zeppelin II that has a second disc of previously unreleased studio outtakes. The Led Zeppelin II companion audio gives fans the first peek into the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recording sessions, with alternate mixes of five songs from the album, backing tracks to Thank You and Living Loving Maid (SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Just A Woman), and the previously unreleased track La La. The deluxe sets feature original artwork, plus a newly created negative artwork for the companion audio. The box set contains everything, including the book and hi-res downloads.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4044cc97fa22e003ef96fd7c018e0c107d064499","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Led+Zeppelin+II+%282014%29+Super+Deluxe+Edition+FLAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4044cc97fa22e003ef96fd7c018e0c107d064499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,68,204,151,250,34,224,3,239,150,253,124,1,142,12,16,125,6,68,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
