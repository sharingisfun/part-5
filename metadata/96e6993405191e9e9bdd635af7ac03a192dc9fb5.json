The footage from Scott's television program focuses almost exclusively on his fundraising efforts and an elaborate rant against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Scott at one point refuses to speak until his viewers pledge an additional $600. After a minute's silence, he yells angrily at the camera until a production assistant informs him that they had already received $700. Scott represents the FCC on his show by a cymbal-banging monkey toy.\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Glaube und Wahrung.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 087 Kbps\nLength            : 653 MiB for 43mn 43s 960ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 700 x 576 (1.295) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : de\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #3           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #4           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #5           : VobSub\nLanguage          : ru\n\nText #6           : VobSub\nLanguage          : it\n\nText #7           : VobSub\nLanguage          : tr\n\nText #8           : VobSub\nLanguage          : ar\n\nText #9           : VobSub\nLanguage          : zh\n\nText #10           : VobSub\nLanguage          : zh\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080796/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080796/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy rip of the Goethe Institut DVD\n\nWerner Herzog - God's Angry Man (1981)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e6993405191e9e9bdd635af7ac03a192dc9fb5","amp;dn":"Werner+Herzog+-+God%27s+Angry+Man+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e6993405191e9e9bdd635af7ac03a192dc9fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,230,153,52,5,25,30,158,155,221,99,90,247,172,3,161,146,220,159,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
