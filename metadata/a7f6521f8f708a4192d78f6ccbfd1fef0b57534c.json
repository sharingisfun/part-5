In this compelling story, Dickens shows the dangers of being driven by a desire for wealth and social status. Pip must establish his own sense of self against the plans which others seem to have for him, and thus discover a firm set of values and priorities. Whether such values will allow one to prosper in the complex world of early Victorian England is, however, the major question posed by Great Expectations, one of Dickens's most fascinating and disturbing novels.\nThere is an excellent unabridged narration of this novel by Simon Vance posted by codeblank here in 2011 as well as my own version posted back in 2008 read by the brilliant Martin Jarvis. There is also the abridged version posted by duckplumber a few days ago narrated by the wonderful Tom Baker. (All of these are still seeded). This is the new unabridged Naxos version on 15 CD's by the equally talented Anton Lesser. Take your pick of narrator - they are all very good!\n\n\nToday is the bicentenary of DickensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ birth on February 7, 1812 at Landport, in Portsea, near Portsmouth, England. If Jane Austen is wholly a Regency author, then Charles Dickens is her Victorian counterpart in popularity.\nHe would become the most famous author of his day, writing sixteen major novels and traveling the world with his speaking tours.(LA)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7f6521f8f708a4192d78f6ccbfd1fef0b57534c","amp;dn":"Great+Expectations+-+Charles+Dickens++%28Unabridged%3A+Anton+Lessor%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7f6521f8f708a4192d78f6ccbfd1fef0b57534c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,246,82,31,143,112,138,65,146,215,143,108,203,253,31,239,11,87,83,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
