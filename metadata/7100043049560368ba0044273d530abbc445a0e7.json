When they first met in Pans in late 1887, they were two of a number of artists seeking a way to move beyond Impressionism. They found common ground in the belief that progressive art should be created at a distance from urban decadence, a conviction that led Gauguin to Brittany and van Gogh to Aries in the early months of 1888","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7100043049560368ba0044273d530abbc445a0e7","amp;dn":"Van+Gogh+and+Gauguin+-+The+Studio+of+the+South+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7100043049560368ba0044273d530abbc445a0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,0,4,48,73,86,3,104,186,0,68,39,61,83,10,187,196,69,160,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
