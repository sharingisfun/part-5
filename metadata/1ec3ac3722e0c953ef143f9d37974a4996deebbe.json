The group originated in The Spectres, founded by schoolboys Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster in 1962. After a number of lineup changes, the band became The Status Quo in 1967 and Status Quo in 1969.\n\nThey have had over 60 chart hits in the UK, starting with 1967's &quot;Pictures Of Matchstick Men&quot;, and the most recent being in 2010, which is more than any other rock group. 22 of which reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1991, Status Quo received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\n\nStatus Quo starred in their first feature film, Bula Quo!, which was released to cinemas in July 2013. The film coincided with the release of the soundtrack album Bula Quo!, which peaked at number 10 in the UK Albums Chart. The first single from the album, &quot;Bula Bula Quo&quot; was released in June 2013, and is Status Quo's one hundredth single release.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAquostic (Stripped Bare) is the thirty-first studio album by English rock band Status Quo, first released on 17 October 2014.
