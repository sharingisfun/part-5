Recently, many major studios have stated their plans to migrate many of their features to 3D. Television manufacturers, on the other hand, have already launched 3D-ready models, with promises that many more will come. There have been announcements of 3D broadcast channels in America, Europe and Asia.\nSoon 3D, like HD not so long ago, will have a major impact in the TV and movies industry. And the majority of our programs and movies will come to life. Will the subtitling industry stall?\nNot for long.\n3DTitles is here to help you prepare and deliver high quality 3D subtitles. And it is fully compatible with some of the most significant 3D technologies and file formats, ensuring compatibility with Sony Blu-ray BDN XML with 3D Stereoscopic extensions format along with Final Cut ProÃ‚Â® XML and EDL file formats. The files 3DTitles creates can be used as well with AVIDÃ‚Â® and AdobeÃ‚Â® PremiereÃ‚Â® with ease.\n\nSubtitles are turning to a new dimension\nWhile for quite sometime it was considered that 2D subtitles can simply be applied to 3D material the overall result is not convenient. If the subtitles are not properly depth positioned within the 3D space they will seem out of place most of time, ruining both the whole 3D illusion and viewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience.\nThe possibility of adding depth to the subtitles became a must as it enables to appear properly on the screen for every viewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convenience.\nThe vast majority of the process of adding depth to standard 2D subtitles is fully automated with 3DTitles. With the help of our integrated real time auto-depth detecting system the program will automatically estimate the depth of the subtitles. And if the automation result is not satisfying the subtitler just have to choose the point of interest to which the subtitle shall be positioned to and simply click. 3DTitles will automatically calculate the necessary depth and apply it for the chosen subtitle.\n\nIn a new, dynamic position\nFor a proper display of the subtitles in 3D TV or cinema they have to remain perfectly positioned within the 3-dimensional space according to the dynamically changing points of interest. But at some point a single subtitle may stay on the screen for more than one shot. And it has to remain easy to read in relation to the changed point of interest when the new shot hits the screen.\nLuckily, 3DTitles has an answer for this kind of issues. A single subtitleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depth position can be changed as many of times as needed in order for the text to remain perfectly positioned in all conditions.\nFinally, 3DTitles is fully compatible with your existing 2D subtitle files. And each subtitleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depth position can be recorded into the original file for simplicity.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nEZTitles\n\nOpen/DVD and Teletext Subtitles, Closed Captions\nEZTitles is designed to work as a world-class professional subtitling software.
