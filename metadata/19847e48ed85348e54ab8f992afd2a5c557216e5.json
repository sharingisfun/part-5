The album was released on September 20, 2013 through Beluga Heights Records and Warner Bros. Records and its affiliated record labels. Incorporating a base core of R&amp;B, pop music and Electronic dance music, Derulo wanted the album to be &quot;totally different&quot; from his previous albums and show the growth in his writing and his overall performance saying &quot;there are so many twists and turns on the album... It's important when someone thinks they've figured you out to flip them&quot;. A deluxe edition of the album featuring 3 bonus tracks, was released simultaneously alongside the eleven-track standard edition, which will only be made available in some European and Oceania countries.  Derulo co-wrote every song on the album, also calling upon the likes of RedOne, Ricky Reed, DJ Frank E, Jonas Jeberg and Martin Johnson as well as others, to handle production for the album. In total Derulo had written over 300 songs and recorded between 100 to 120 songs for the album over a one year period. Amongst those included are collaborations with rappers 2 Chainz, The Game and Pitbull, in addition to his long time girlfriend Jordin Sparks who features on a song called &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Occasionally the album dips into other genres such adult contemporary and soul music.  Tattoos was promoted with live renditions of the album's songs during The Tattoos World Tour. The album was also preceded by the release of the lead single, a Joshua &quot;Ammo&quot; Coleman and Martin Johnson production called &quot;The Other Side&quot;, which peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. A second single, &quot;Talk Dirty&quot;, featuring American hip hop artist 2 Chainz, was released on August 2, 2013, it has since topped the charts in the United Kingdom and 13 other countries. Follow-up singles &quot;Marry Me&quot; was released a month before the album and reached the top-ten in Australia and top-twenty in New Zealand, whilst &quot;Trumpets&quot; was released in November 2013, peaking at number one in Australia and on the UK R&amp;B singles chart. &quot;Stupid Love&quot; was released on March 24, 2014, as the fifth overall single and is currently impacting charts..\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] The Other Side\n[02] Talk Dirty - - - Jason DerÃƒÂ¼lo Featuring 2 Chainz\n[03] Marry Me\n[04] Tattoo\n[05] Trumpets\n[06] Vertigo - - - Jason DerÃƒÂ¼lo Featuring Jordin Sparks\n[07] Fire - - - Jason DerÃƒÂ¼lo Featuring Pitbull\n[08] Side FX - - - Jason DerÃƒÂ¼lo Featuring The Game\n[09] Stupid Love\n[10] With The Lights On\n[11] Rest Of Our Life\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:38m:19s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 101mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
