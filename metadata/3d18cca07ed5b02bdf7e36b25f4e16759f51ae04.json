Romero, his second comic after &quot;The Death of Death&quot;, a mini-series he wrote for the DC Comics anthology Toe Tags in 2004 and 2005. Empire features zombies similar to those in his Living Dead series of films. One way the series departs from his films is that vampires are also part of the story.\n\nPublication history\n\nThe series was announced in October 2013, as a 15-issue miniseries, split between three 5-issue acts. Act One launched in January 2014, with art by Alex Maleev, and ended in June 2014. Act Two, which featured art by Dalibor Talajic, began in September 2014 and will end in January 2015. - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nGeorge Romero's Empire Of The Dead Act One (001 - 005) (2014) (Digital) (Nahga-Empire)\n(001 - 005)\n\nGeorge Romero's Empire of the Dead - Act Two (001-003) (2015) (Digital) (Zone-Empire)\n(001-003)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d18cca07ed5b02bdf7e36b25f4e16759f51ae04","amp;dn":"George+Romero%27s+Empire+Of+The+Dead+Act+One+%28Complete%29Act+Two+%2800","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d18cca07ed5b02bdf7e36b25f4e16759f51ae04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,24,204,160,126,213,176,43,223,126,54,178,95,78,22,117,159,81,174,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
