It was acquired for release by HBO, but quickly shelved and never shown.  An official reason was never given, but probably involved legal clearances and permission from documentary subjects and interviewees.\n\nAward winner at Sundance 1998, this copy of Frat House was exported for viewing before HBO decided to shelve the movie.\n\n\nThe weird farming clip is a result of the VHS being partially taped over.  Apologies.\n\n\n\n\nFRAT HOUSE\n58 minutes\n.m4v container\nh.264 video\nAAC stereo audio\n720x480 anamorphic to 4:3\n29.97 fps\n1887 kbits/sec\n776 MB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139221/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139221/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6881ae1a1cf6d09a051aad48fee1de4bf6e7a2b3","amp;dn":"FRAT+HOUSE+-+unreleased+HBO+documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6881ae1a1cf6d09a051aad48fee1de4bf6e7a2b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,129,174,26,28,246,208,154,5,26,173,72,254,225,222,75,246,231,162,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
