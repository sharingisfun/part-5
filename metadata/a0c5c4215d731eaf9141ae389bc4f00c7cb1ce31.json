It is the \n\nthird installment in the popular Driver series and was developed by Reflections Interactive and published by Atari. Driv3r \n\nwas released in North America for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on June 21, 2004. In Europe, it was officially released on June \n\n25, although due to the way Atari shipped the title across the continent, it made its way into independent UK retailers \n\nbefore the release date, even making a #6 position in the ELSPA chart for that week. On March 15, 2005, it was released on \n\nPC for US customers, it was also released on Game Boy Advance October 25, 2005. At one point a Nintendo GameCube \n\nversion and an N-Gage version were planned, but both were canceled.\nDriv3r brings back features from Driver 2 and adds the ability to ride motorcycles and boats, use weapons, swim, climb \n\nladders, and enter certain buildings among other things, controlling more than one character, as well as entering and \n\nexiting cars.\nAlthough two Driver games were published between them, 2011's Driver: San Francisco is considered the sequel to Driv3r.\n\nDeveloper(s) :- Reflections Interactive\nPublisher(s) :- Atari\nDesigner(s) :- Martin Edmondson\nSeries :- Driver\nPlatform :-  Microsoft Windows\nRelease date(s) :- Microsoft Windows\n                   NA March 15, 2005\n                   EU March 18, 2005\nGenre(s) :- Action, Shooter\nMode(s) :- Single-player\nLanguage :- Multi Language\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS :-\n\nMINIMUM PC REQUIREMENTS\nWindows 2000/XP\nPentium 4 or AMD Athlon 1.5GHz Processor\n256MB RAM\n5.5GB Hard Disk Space\n4X CD-ROM Drive\n64MB Video Card with Hardware T&amp;L\nDirectX compatible Sound Card\nDirectX 9.0c\n\nInstall Notes :-\n1.UnRAR the app\n2.Click on setup.bat\n3.Wait few minutes\n4.Press any key to continue\n5.Open game from Driv3r.exe\nAnd play and Injoy.........\n\nNote:- UnRAR using 7-Zip/WinRar/Universal Extractor\n\nScreenshots :-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img4/4613/2juj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img4/4613/2juj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img842/3766/4wb6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img842/3766/4wb6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img18/6500/2thv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img18/6500/2thv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img20/1936/ypah.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img20/1936/ypah.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img89/6083/aeyl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img89/6083/aeyl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img822/5093/5dw7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img822/5093/5dw7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img543/5015/46gd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img543/5015/46gd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img34/9341/9eud.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img34/9341/9eud.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img844/6241/04od.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img844/6241/04od.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img837/2727/zeps.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img837/2727/zeps.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRemember Me..................IGI30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c5c4215d731eaf9141ae389bc4f00c7cb1ce31","amp;dn":"Driv3r+%7BDRIVER+3%7D+2005+Full+PC+Game+%7BHighly+Compress%7D+%7BUploaded%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c5c4215d731eaf9141ae389bc4f00c7cb1ce31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,197,196,33,93,115,30,175,145,65,174,56,155,196,240,12,124,177,206,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
