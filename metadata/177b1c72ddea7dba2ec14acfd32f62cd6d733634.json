The focus is on algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in computer science and engineering. Motivation is provided from the application areas: all solutions and techniques from computational geometry are related to particular applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and geographic information systems. For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study by anyone with a basic background in algorithms.\n\nIn this third edition, besides revisions to the second edition, new sections discussing Voronoi diagrams of line segments, farthest-point Voronoi diagrams, and realistic input models have been added.\n\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 386 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 3rd edition (April 16, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3540779736\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3540779735","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177b1c72ddea7dba2ec14acfd32f62cd6d733634","amp;dn":"Computational+Geometry+Algorithms+and+Applications+%28Berg%2C+Cheong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177b1c72ddea7dba2ec14acfd32f62cd6d733634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,123,28,114,221,234,125,186,46,193,74,207,211,47,98,205,109,115,54,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
