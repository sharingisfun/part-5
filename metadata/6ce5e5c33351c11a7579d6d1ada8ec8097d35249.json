This 'productive laziness' approach builds on the Pareto principle that states that for \nmany phenomena, 80 per cent of consequences stem from 20 per cent of the causes. To put it simply, only 20 per cent of the things people do during \ntheir working days really matter. Inside this insightful and informative book you'll discover: * The intelligence of laziness - why smart, lazy people have \nthe edge over others; * Why the Jungle Book's 'Bare Necessities' should be the productive lazy theme tune; * How to get the maximum output for a \nminimised input; * Quick tips to productive lazy heaven. Everyone wants to achieve more without chaining themselves to their desk. \nBy concentrating your project management and learning to exercise effort where it really matters, you can learn to work smarter. \nWelcome to the home of 'productive laziness'.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce5e5c33351c11a7579d6d1ada8ec8097d35249","amp;dn":"The+Lazy+Project+Manager-+How+to+be+twice+as+productive+and+stil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce5e5c33351c11a7579d6d1ada8ec8097d35249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,229,229,195,51,81,193,26,117,121,214,209,173,168,236,128,151,211,82,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
