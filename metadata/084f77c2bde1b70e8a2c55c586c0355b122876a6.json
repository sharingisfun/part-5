The band is led by singer-songwriter and multi instrumentalist Zac Little who originally hails from rural Appalachia. Following in the footsteps of heartland bands who have sought to twist the music of the old weird America into new shapes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the Violent Femmes to Neutral Milk Hotel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Saintseneca perform songs that sound both familiar and uniquely original. The group utilizes a wide range of acoustic instrumentation with more contemporary elements such as synthesizers and electric guitars to create a seamless blend of soaring vocals and vibrant post-punk energy.\n\nAs Nashville Scene writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Saintseneca spins isolation into folk gold... On Dark Arc, Little's once minimalist compositions seem to miraculously twirl from sparse acoustic arrangements into layered space-rock jams that Built to Spill would be proud of&quot; while Pitchfork.com offered, &quot;bandleader Zac Little writes stompy folk songs that are more artfully crafted than all the bands you probably just thought of when you read the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“stompy folk songs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084f77c2bde1b70e8a2c55c586c0355b122876a6","amp;dn":"Saintseneca+-+Dark+Arc+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084f77c2bde1b70e8a2c55c586c0355b122876a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,79,119,194,189,225,183,14,138,44,85,197,134,192,53,91,18,40,118,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
