This hardcore instrument is created for both producers, composers and DJs. The style is mostly focused on Skrillex oriented Brostep type of sounds, so expect facemelting material from A-Z.\n\nWe created 40 different core kits, which covers all corners of the current Dubstep realm. We have hundreds of basses, leads, glitched vocal FX, drums and bonus patches containing side-chained synths and additional vocal FX. Everything is perfectly tempo-synced to your host and everything is controllable directly from your keys, including pitch, live-triggered FX etc.\n\n8Dio Dubstep is using a highly advanced, yet ultra intuitive layout that essentially allows you to control most things from you keyboard. The bottom part of the keyboard controls the pitch of the sounds. The mid part of the keyboard controls the sounds themselves. The upper part of the keyboard gives you real-time control over all the effects, including distortion, phaser, flanger, lofi, convolution reverb, delay, lowpass, hipass and several other effects.\n\nIn addition we also added a Talk-Talk FX to the modwheel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ giving you an extreme amount of controls right at your finger tips. The entire library comes in open 44.1/24 Bit Format.\n\nDubstep Basses and Wobbles\nDubstep Lead Synths and Vox FX\nDubstep Designed Drum Kits\nDubstep Groove Designers\nBonus: Side-Chain Synths\n\nDubstep Drum Kits\nDubstep Basses\nDubstep Lead Synths\nDubstep Vocal FX\nDubstep Sidechained Synths\nSpecific Beat Machine Patches\nSpecific Time Machine Patches\nIndividual Stem Parts of all elements\nBonus Side-Chained Synths\nBonus Vocal FX\nDual Custom convolution reverb\nUnique Dubstep Talking FX on Modwheel\nKeyboard swithes for all FX\nLo-fi\nRotator\nSkreamer\nDelay\nConvolution\nDistortion\n20 Kontakt .nki files\nApprox. 2000 samples\n4.3 GB installed\n24 bit / 44.1 kHz stereo PCM wav format\nSample resolution: 44.1Khz / 24Bit stereo .wav format\nFormat(s): Kontakt\n\n\n\n\nfuture-dada.com   MMXIII","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ac4189c26cfdf9702188c8dc23d2339bee9aac","amp;dn":"8Dio.Dubstep.KONTAKT-SYNTHiC4TE-packet-dada","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ac4189c26cfdf9702188c8dc23d2339bee9aac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,172,65,137,194,108,253,249,112,33,136,200,220,35,210,51,155,238,154,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
