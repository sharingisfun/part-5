TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re intelligent, skilled, and even charismatic. But only a handful of them will ever reach the pinnacle -- and as executive coach Marshall Goldsmith shows in this book, subtle nuances make all the difference. These are small &quot;transactional flaws&quot; performed by one person against another (as simple as not saying thank you enough), which lead to negative perceptions that can hold any executive back. Using GoldsmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s straightforward, jargon-free advice, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazingly easy behavior to change.\n \nExecutives who hire Goldsmith for one-on-one coaching pay $250,000 for the privilege. With this book, his help is available for 1/10,000th of the price.\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a99af9090b74d5c82d82f74fac6206981ace643","amp;dn":"%5BRare%5D+Marshall+Goldsmith+-+What+Got+You+Here+Won%27t+Get+You+Ther","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a99af9090b74d5c82d82f74fac6206981ace643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,153,175,144,144,183,77,92,130,216,47,116,250,198,32,105,129,172,230,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
