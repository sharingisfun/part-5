Ned and his wife Catelyn receive a letter from Catelyn's sister, Lysa that gives them reason to believe that rival House Lannister - who the King's wife Cersei belongs to - was the cause of the previous Hand's death. Ned must travel south to help the king and find out who killed the Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, while trying to protect his family from the Lannisters. As he tries to uncover the reasons behind Jon Arryn's death he uncovers the dark secrets about the Lannisters that Arryn himself died trying to expose.\n\nMeanwhile, across the Narrow Sea in the continent of Essos, the exiled, arrogant Viserys Targaryen, son of the former king whose throne was usurped, believes he still has the rightful claim to the throne. He marries off his younger sister, Daenerys Targaryen, whom he has psychologically and physically abused for years, to the leader of the Dothraki warrior tribe, Khal Drogo, in an exchange for an army to return to Westeros and take the throne. However, Daenerys' growing love for Drogo and newfound mental strength as the Khaleesi of the tribe means Viserys' plans go unexpectedly and powerfully awry.\n\nAnd beyond the wall, Ned's bastard son Jon Snow joins the Night's Watch, an ancient brotherhood sworn to watch over the massive Wall that separates the Seven Kingdoms from the dangerous unknown beyond. But an ancient force, long believed dead, threatens the land.\n\n\n.::Media Information::.\n=======================\n\n-:General:-\n-----------\nFormat: Matroska\nAverage File size: 400 MiB\nAverage Overall bit rate: 1 000 Kbps\nSource: 1080p BluRay x264 DTS-HDChina\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoded date: 18-19th February 2013\nWriting application: mkvmerge v5.7.0 ('The Whirlwind') built on Jul 8 2012 20:08:51\nWriting library: libebml v1.2.3 + libmatroska v1.3.0\n\n-:Video:-\n---------\nID: 2\nFormat: AVC\nFormat/Info: Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bef6d7d9d6fef28d908f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC: Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames: 4 frames\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nWidth: 1 280 pixels\nHeight: 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9\nFrame rate: 23.976 fps\nColor space: YUV\nChroma subsampling: 4:2:0\nBit depth: 8 bits\nScan type: Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.043\nWriting library: x264 core 125 r2208 d9d2288\n\n-:Audio:-\n---------\nID: 2\nFormat: AAC\nFormat/Info: Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile: HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID: A_AAC\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nChannel positions: Front: L R\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode: Lossy\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ac1b54377988acbad5b1bcf50e8c56658c9707","amp;dn":"Game+Of+Thrones+%282011%29+Season+1+BluRay+720p+x264+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ac1b54377988acbad5b1bcf50e8c56658c9707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,172,27,84,55,121,136,172,186,213,177,188,245,14,140,86,101,140,151,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
