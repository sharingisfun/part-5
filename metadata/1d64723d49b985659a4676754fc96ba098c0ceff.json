He claims that the cops are too stupid to find out about it when it's well executed, and that the robbers are too stupid to execute it the right way; and that he could do it himself relying on his photographic memory and his strategic planning skills. After he is invited on a hunting trip away from his home, an accident gives him the chance of his life: the possibility to commit the perfect crime he has been waiting for.\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY GA_GUN.........!!!!!!\n\nGA_GUN.....UPLOADER OF RARE AND GOOD MOVIES.......ENJOY !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d64723d49b985659a4676754fc96ba098c0ceff","amp;dn":"El+Aura+%28The+Aura%29+2005+Eng+Sub+DVDRIP+-+GA_GUN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d64723d49b985659a4676754fc96ba098c0ceff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,100,114,61,73,185,133,101,154,70,118,117,79,201,107,160,152,192,206,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
