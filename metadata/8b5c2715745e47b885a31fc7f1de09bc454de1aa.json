Each volume covers a particular period, with care taken to avoid unduly privileging Western notions of periodization, and the volumes cover progressively shorter chronological spans, reflecting both the greater geographical range of later volumes and the steep increase in historical activity around the world since the nineteenth century.  This set is the first collective scholarly survey of the history of historical writing to cover the globe across such a substantial breadth of time.\n\n\nThe following volumes are in PDF format:\n\n* VOLUME 1: BEGINNINGS TO AD 600 (Oxford UP, 2012).  672 pp.  Edited by Andrew Feldherr and Grant Hardy.\n\n* VOLUME 2: 600-1400 (Oxford UP, 2011).  672 pp.  Edited by Sarah Foot and Chase F. Robinson.\n\n* VOLUME 3: 1400-1800 (Oxford UP, 2011).  752 pp.  Edited by JosÃƒÂ© Rabasa, Masayuki Sato, Edoardo Tortarolo, and Daniel Woolf.\n\n* VOLUME 4: 1800-1945 (Oxford UP, 2011).  672 pp.  Edited by Stuart Macintyre, Juan Maiguashca, and Attila PÃƒÂ³k.\n\n* VOLUME 5: HISTORICAL WRITING SINCE 1945 (Oxford UP, 2012).  744 pp.  Edited by Axel Schneider and Daniel Woolf.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
