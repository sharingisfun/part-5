It is the brainchild of Dante Trudel who used the term 'Doggcrapp' for this program because it was his username on a forum where his posts about bodybuilding practices were an instant hit (he has since expressed regret about the choice of name). Trudel admits to have been taken in by the old bodybuilding magazine workouts when he first began training at the age of 20 where he weighed just 137 pounds. He credits his training system with transforming him into the 270-280 pound behemoth he is today.\n\n\nWhat are the basic principles of DC?\n\n    Heavy progressive weights\n    Lower workout volume but higher workout frequency\n    Multirep rest-pause training\n    Extreme stretching\n    Carb cutoffs later in the day\n    Morning cardio\n    Higher protein intake\n    Blasting and cruising phases","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4a9de5e9eafe7821f98b901a546eee924b8b96","amp;dn":"Bodybuilding+-+Dante+Trudel%27s+Doggcrapp+Training+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4a9de5e9eafe7821f98b901a546eee924b8b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,74,157,229,233,234,254,120,33,249,139,144,26,84,110,238,146,75,139,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
