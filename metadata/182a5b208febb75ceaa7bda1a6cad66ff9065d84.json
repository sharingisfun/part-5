As Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, Tyson makes regular appearances as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expert on spaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on major news programs and popular shows (Daily Show, Colbert Report).\n\nTysonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings (such as The Sky is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist) and NOVA specials (Origins, and NOVA ScienceNOW) have already won him a faithful media following. His most recent book, Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries reached the New York Times Best Seller List. Tyson was named Time MagazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 100 Most Influential Persons in the World for 2007.\n\nStarTalk Radio bridges the intersection between Pop Culture and Science with clarity, humor and passion. Captivating subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â€such as space travel, extra-terrestrial life, the Big Bang, the future of our Earth and the environment, and breaking news from the universeÃ¢â‚¬â€will all be explored. Hilarity ensues as Tyson is joined each week by comedian co-hosts, celebrities, and other special guests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:182a5b208febb75ceaa7bda1a6cad66ff9065d84","amp;dn":"StarTalk+Radio+show+with++Neil+deGrasse+Tyson+%28Selected%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"182a5b208febb75ceaa7bda1a6cad66ff9065d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,42,91,32,143,235,183,92,234,167,189,161,166,202,214,111,249,6,93,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
