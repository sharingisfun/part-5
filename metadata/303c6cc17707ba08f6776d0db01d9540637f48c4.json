Myrkur is signed to Relapse Records; initially the real-life identity of the person behind the project was kept unknown.\n\nThe project debuted with a self-titled EP in 2014; Bruun provided the vocals, played all guitars and bass and produced the album. \nDrums were played by her friend Rex Myrnur.\n\nIn June 2015, Myrkur announced the release of a full length album, entitled M, to be released on August 21st 2015 via Relapse Records. \nThe album was produced by Kristoffer Rygg of Ulver, and featured Teloch of Mayhem on guitars, with ÃƒËœyvind Myrvoll of Nidingr and Dodheimsgard on drums.\n\nM (LP, expected release 21 August 2015)\nTrack Listing\n\n    &quot;SkÃƒÂ¸gen Skulle DÃƒÂ¸&quot;\n    &quot;HÃƒÂ¦vnen&quot;\n    &quot;Onde BÃƒÂ¸rn&quot;\n    &quot;VÃƒÂ¸lvens SpÃƒÂ¥dom&quot;\n    &quot;Jeg er Guden, I er Tjenerne&quot;\n    &quot;Nordlys&quot;\n    &quot;Mordet&quot;\n    &quot;Byssan Lull&quot;\n    &quot;Dybt i Skoven&quot;\n    &quot;SkaÃƒÂ°i&quot;  - 04:54\n    &quot;Norn&quot;\n\n\nWhen MyrkurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-titled debut EP was released last year, nobody knew that classically trained Danish multi-instrumentalist Amalie Bruun was behind the black metal project. \nPart of the anonymity was due to the fact that she plays in an alt-rock band, Ex Cops, whose 2014 album Daggers was produced by Billy CorganÃ¢â‚¬â€and the metal community can be pretty hardcore when it comes to gatekeeping. \nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also just part of that realm: Anonymity helps maintain the atmosphere that old-school black metal needs to be successful. \nBut, of course, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more difficult to stay hidden nowadays than it was during the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90s formative years. \nInevitably, commenters unmasked Bruun, and thenÃ¢â‚¬â€because this is how the Internet worksÃ¢â‚¬â€that Ã¢â‚¬Å“gotcha!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ detective work also became part of the story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:303c6cc17707ba08f6776d0db01d9540637f48c4","amp;dn":"Myrkur+-+M++%282015%29+3320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"303c6cc17707ba08f6776d0db01d9540637f48c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,60,108,193,119,7,186,8,246,119,109,13,176,29,149,64,99,127,72,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
