Elbogen also founded Euphobia Records that same year as an outlet to release his records, the first of which was the Discosadness LP. Both that album and its enchanting follow-up, 2003's Numbers &amp; Mumbles, were recorded on Elbogen's homemade PC, and his hands-on approach captured Say Hi to Your Mom's tightly woven acoustic sound in progress. For 2005's Ferocious Mopes, drummer Chris Egan III and ex-Sea Ray keyboardist Jeff Sheinkopf were added to the Say Hi to Your Mom lineup after touring in support of Numbers &amp; Mumbles. North American shows with Nada Surf followed, and additional tour dates with Dirty on Purpose coincided with the 2006 release of Impeccable Blahs.\n\n  Two years later, the group shortened its name to Say Hi and released The Wishes and the Glitch in February 2008. They also signed with Barsuk Records and took up residence in Seattle. Oohs &amp; Aahs, the band's sixth album, was released in early 2009, having been recorded entirely by Elbogen in his home studio one year prior. The band's seventh-studio album Um, Uh Oh featuring the single &quot;Devils&quot; was released in January of 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:171ecaf8964f4e02419f3d6da4a4510a8ef5ebf9","amp;dn":"Say+Hi+-+Discography+%282002-2013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"171ecaf8964f4e02419f3d6da4a4510a8ef5ebf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,30,202,248,150,79,78,2,65,159,61,109,164,164,81,10,142,245,235,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
