But in a culture full of bad advice, predatory banks, and splurge-now-pay-later temptations, it can also be extremely dangerous--leading you to make financial decisions that could hurt you for years to come. Combine this with a slumped economy, mounds of student loans, and dubious examples from reality TV stars to politicians to your own parents, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder so many twenty-somethings are struggling.\n\n Twenty-three-year-old Zac Bissonnette--the author of Debt-Free U--knows exactly what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going through. He demystifies the many traps young people fall victim to in their post-college years. He offers fresh insights on everything from job hunting to buying a car to saving for retirement that will give you a foundation for a secure, stable, and happy life. In the process, he reveals why FICO scores are overrated, online job applications are a waste of time, car loans are for suckers, and credit card rewards are a scam.\n With detours to discuss wine connoisseurs, Really Broke Housewives, and Lenny Dykstra, Zac shows you how to make better choices today so you can be richer, smarter (and better-looking!) for years to come.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e3206b3560ab3f75ab587bc43d66525aecdcab","amp;dn":"How+to+Be+Richer%2C+Smarter%2C+and+Better+Looking+Than+Your+Parents+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e3206b3560ab3f75ab587bc43d66525aecdcab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,227,32,107,53,96,171,63,117,171,88,123,196,61,102,82,90,236,220,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
