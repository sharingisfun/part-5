One such story is what is known as &quot;Curse of Ham&quot;, or &quot;Curse of Canaan&quot;, which refers to the curse that Ham's father Noah placed upon Ham's son Canaan, after Ham &quot;saw his father's nakedness&quot; because of drunkenness in Noah's tent. It is related in the Book of Genesis 9:20-27 as follows:\n\n20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: \n21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. \n22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. \n23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. \n24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. \n25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. \n26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\n\nNow, according to Genesis 10, Noah had three sons:\n-  Ham: the forefather of the southern peoples (Hamitic Africa)\n-  Shem: the forefather of the middle peoples (Semitic)\n-  Japheth: the forefather of the northern peoples (Japhetic Eurasia)\n\nThe above story was used by some followers of Judeo-Christianity to justify racism and the enslavement of people of Black African ancestry, who were believed to be descendants of Ham. \n\nIt is clear that the above is a fabricated story, and it has  many problems. First, Ham is not directly cursed for his actions; instead the curse falls upon his youngest son Canaan. Second, the curse seems unusually severe for merely observing Noah unclothed. Third, it is historically and scientifically impossible for the black people to be descendents of Canaan.\n\nRegarding the severity of the curse that falls on Canaan because of Ham's mistake, some biblical scholars and commentators suggested that Ham committed a transgression worse than just seeing his father nakedness. They suggested that the phrase &quot;exposing or uncovering nakedness&quot; is a metaphor that Ham sodomized his father Noah.\nAnother group of biblical scholars went a step further. They suggested that while Noah was drunk and unaware of what is going around him, Ham took the opportunity and raped a woman that was in the tent with Noah. This woman was Noah's wife; i.e. Ham's own mother.\n\nExamining all of the above makes one wonder who is the wickedest of them all?\nIs it the authors of the Bible who fabricated all these fictitious stories about God's prophets?\nOr, is it the racists who use (misuse) the Bible to justify racism and slavery?\nOr, is it the biblical scholars and commentators with their wild erotic imaginations?\nOr, is it the people who blindly believe these stories?\n\nThis upload contains 32 titles.
