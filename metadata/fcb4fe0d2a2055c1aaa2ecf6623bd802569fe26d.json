These illustrations are supplemented by more than 450 digitized full-color online photomicrographs of histological images. Part One explains tissues and their relationship to their systems; Part Two addresses organs in a similar way.\n\nTargeting undergraduate, allied health and first and second year medical students, the Eleventh Edition includes new and enhanced images through redrawing and digitization to provide increased detail. This edition also features updated illustrations and information on the functions of cells, tissues, and organs of the body based on advances in research and expert recommendations.\n\nThe atlas' student-friendly &quot;Functional Correlations&quot; sections help students study structure and function together. Students also benefit from a &quot;realistic&quot; perspective as more than 70 micrographs appear adjacent to color illustrations.\n\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bfd2cad7ded2d2dedb91c8decedecd91dedddddeccffd3d6c9da91dcd0d2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcb4fe0d2a2055c1aaa2ecf6623bd802569fe26d","amp;dn":"diFiore%27s+Atlas+of+Histology+with+Functional+Correlations+%2811th+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcb4fe0d2a2055c1aaa2ecf6623bd802569fe26d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,180,254,13,42,32,85,193,170,162,236,246,98,59,216,2,86,159,226,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
