Everything is given a uniquely Frankie spin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ scabrous, sharp and scathing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a no holds barred comedy that promises everything you already know and love about Frankie with even more added bite.\n\nAmong the sketches in the new series is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Untitled StreetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢: a new BBC soap opera which is so politically correct that actorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s faces are blanked out to avoid causing offence and plots are so ambiguous that the viewers have guess for themselves what itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all about. Others include ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Columbian Showbiz NewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, where anyone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s anyone is invariably shot dead before they make it to the red carpet and a new documentary ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Life in the 2050 houseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Is it all living with robots? Not quite. Boyle satirizes everything we love and loathe about British culture, mixing sketches with stand-up and delivering unadulterated comedy thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the faint-hearted. The UKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most fearless and uncompromising comic at the top of his game, expect brass neck and belly laughs in abundance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9cc728c97f230e7d10f9311c2cedba87f755c07","amp;dn":"Frankie+Boyle+-+Tramadol+Nights+Series+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9cc728c97f230e7d10f9311c2cedba87f755c07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,204,114,140,151,242,48,231,209,15,147,17,194,206,219,168,127,117,92,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
