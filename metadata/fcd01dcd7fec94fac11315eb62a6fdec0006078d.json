Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone is the sound of Lucinda Williams doing what she does best and letting her muse do the speaking, and if that sounds simple, in practice it is and it isn't â€“ this music is taut and soulful, but also a document of one woman baring her spirit and mind to the world, which has always been the case with her best music, and if this isn't a masterpiece, it's as pure, straightforward, and compelling as anything she's done since Essence.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n01 - Compassion\r\n02 - Protection\r\n03 - Burning Bridges\r\n04 - East Side of Town\r\n05 - West Memphis\r\n06 - Cold Day in Hell\r\n07 - Foolishness\r\n08 - Wrong Number\r\n09 - Stand Right by Each Other\r\n10 - It's Gonna Rain\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n01 - Something Wicked This Way Comes\r\n02 - Big Mess\r\n03 - When I Look at the World\r\n04 - Walk On\r\n05 - Temporary Nature (of Any Precious Thing)\r\n06 - Everything but the Truth\r\n07 - This Old Heartache\r\n08 - Stowaway in Your Heart\r\n09 - One More Day\r\n10 - Magnolia\r\n\r\n*2014 Highway 20 Records | H2 001\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucinda Williams - Blessed (2011) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13163588/Lucinda_Williams_-_Blessed_%282011%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcd01dcd7fec94fac11315eb62a6fdec0006078d","amp;dn":"Lucinda+Williams+-+Down+Where+The+Spirit+Meets+The+Bone+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcd01dcd7fec94fac11315eb62a6fdec0006078d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,208,29,205,127,236,148,250,193,19,21,235,98,166,253,236,0,6,7,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
