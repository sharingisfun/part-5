Inside were two audio cassette tapes mini-December 30, 1999 and tagged: The last testament of George Harrison. A voice eerily similar to that of Harrison tells a surprising story: Paul McCartney died in a car accident in November 1966 and replaced by a double!\n\nBritish intelligence, MI5, had forced the Beatles to cover up the death of McCartney to prevent mass suicides by fans. However, the remaining Beatles tracks left on the covers of his albums and songs. Until now, the mystery that exploded worldwide in 1969 was deemed a hoax. However, in this film, the mysterious voice on the tape reveals a secret history of the Beatles, the story of a fatal accident McCartney, concealment, dozens of unknown tracks, and a dangerous game of cat and mouse between The Beatles and MI5. The voice also says that Lennon was murdered in 1980 after he threatened to expose &quot;Paul McCartney&quot;, as an impostor!\n\nHighway 61 Entertainment has investigated this new and startling account of the conspiracy to hide the tragic death of McCartney and produced this unauthorized documentary, which includes new evidence unearthed. The mysterious voice on audio tapes narrated the entire film in what may become the most important document in the history of rock and roll, leaving little doubt that Paul McCartney is really dead!.\n\n\n\n3.3\n\nOriginal title: Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison\nDirector: Joel Gilbert.\nStarring: Documentary.\nCountry: United States.\nGenre: Documentary.\nDuration: 97 Minutes\n\n\nWWW..CRAZY-TORRENT..COM\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/i/thumbs20110226193014.jpg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/i/thumbs20110226193014.jpg/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1b3aaa87469c5816d1e1b42522eb77011a89080","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+Really+Is+Dead+%282010%29.Crazy-torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1b3aaa87469c5816d1e1b42522eb77011a89080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,179,170,168,116,105,197,129,109,30,27,66,82,46,183,112,17,168,144,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
