Four years on, Scott was back with something even more enticing, collaborating on Soused, a body of work he was writing with them in mind. \n\nRecorded in London in early 2014 and produced by Scott Walker and long-time ally Peter Walsh with the assistance of musical director Mark Warman, Soused is a 5-track 50-minute body of work that cements both actsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wide-reaching and otherworldly renown.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
