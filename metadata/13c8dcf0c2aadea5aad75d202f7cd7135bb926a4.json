If the rest of the album doesn't boast another song as tight or concise as this â€“ &quot;Downstream&quot; comes close but it doesn't have the same hook, while &quot;Babaji,&quot; a pseudo-spiritual moment that falls from the pop mark; the other four tracks clock in well over six minutes, with the closer, &quot;Fool's Overture,&quot; reaching nearly 11 minutes â€“ it nevertheless places a greater emphasis on melody and gentle textures than any previous Supertramp release. \r\n\r\nSo, it's a transitional album, bridging the gap between Crime of the Century and the forthcoming Breakfast in America, and even if it's not as full formed as either, it nevertheless has plenty of fine moments aside from &quot;Give a Little Bit,&quot; including the music hall shuffle of &quot;Loverboy,&quot; the Euro-artiness of &quot;From Now On,&quot; and the &quot;Fool on a Hill&quot; allusions on &quot;Fool's Overture.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
