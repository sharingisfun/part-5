Right now I have most of the tablature books from Dream Theater in the best qualities I could find available on the internet, as well as John Petrucci's Suspended Animation book, one of the most sought-after tab books, and Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings\n\nI would very much like to add to this collection, so I need the communities' help in either tracking down or creating high-quality and full-band backing tracks (minus guitar) for playing along with the tab books. This will aid in creating a complete go-to reference for playing Dream Theater music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8381e49298b196e91ee5da01e52142ca5e02c8fe","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+Ultimate+Tab+Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8381e49298b196e91ee5da01e52142ca5e02c8fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,129,228,146,152,177,150,233,30,229,218,1,229,33,66,202,94,2,200,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
