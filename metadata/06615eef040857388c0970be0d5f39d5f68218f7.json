The film is based on a book by Alexander Klein and stars William Holden, Lilli Palmer, Hugh Griffith, Carl Raddatz and Ernst SchrÃƒÂ¶der. Our overall rating for The Counterfeit Traitor is: very good,rewarding film that makes compelling viewing. \n\nBy BOSLEY CROWTHER Published: April 18, 1962\nA likely type of motion picture that hasn't been seen very often in recent years, the good old spy melodrama, comes swirling across the screen again in George Seaton's &quot;The Counterfeit Traitor,&quot; which swooped into the DeMille last night. And all who have been patiently waiting for another dash through the dangerous areas of European back rooms and touch-and-go espionage should find in this large-screen entertainment not only a tingler for the nerves but a rather generous endorsement for certain Germans in World War II.\n\nFor, in the construction of this drama from the raw material of the certified true-life story of an Allied spy in the war, Mr. Seaton has not hesitated to acknowledge and emphasize that his hero was greatly assisted by an anti-Nazi underground in Germany. The gathering of information by this fellow within the Third Reich is nervously helped by several Germans with various axes to grind. And his ultimate desperate dash to safety through Denmark to Sweden (his home base) is accomplished only because an efficient system of underground agents is there to give him aid.\nWhether what we see in this connection is entirely in accordance with fact, it makes for exciting melodrama, the tingling hum of the spy machinery and a gracious condescension to the sensibilities of our allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in this much later day. (It also made, we imagine, for greater facility in the brilliant photographing of much of the action in many colorful locations in Germany.)\nAnd, of course, it makes for the inclusion of a German woman who gives not only aid but also idealistic encouragement and romantic relaxation and suspense. With lovely Lilli Palmer playing this woman to William Holden's alert, acerbic spy, a delightful agitation of the emotions Ã¢â‚¬â€ the soft emotions Ã¢â‚¬â€ is got through most of the film.\n\nActually, as his own script writer, Mr. Seaton has contrived his play pretty much as a series of confrontations between his hero and other menacing men. The first of these confrontations comes as the hero is being dragooned to act as a spy by a wily British intelligence agent who virtually blackmails him. The hero (our cagey Mr. Holden), a Swedish-American, has been trading in oil with the Nazis and is &quot;blacklisted&quot; by the Allies. To gain eventual clearance, he is compelled to engage in espionage while making his presumably nefarious business trips to Germany.Hugh Griffith plays the British agent with such impudent casualness that the sneaky illogic of the intrigue becomes both tolerable and droll.\n\nOthers by whom the hero is then confronted along the wayÃ¢â‚¬â€or whom he confronts with impositionsÃ¢â‚¬â€are a sturdy German baron and oil tycoon, a Nazi envoy to Sweden, a courteous Hamburg friend and his decidedly obnoxious, Hitler Youth-brainwashed son and several varieties of Gestapo and military personnel.\n\nIf one notes in Mr. Seaton's drama certain incidents with a strong resemblance to familiar incidents in such previous inside-Europe pictures as &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing.&quot; &quot;Germany Year Zero&quot; and &quot;The Search,&quot; one can only be grateful to him for borrowing with taste and for handling the material as his own director with superior skill and style.\n\nHe has also commanded fine performances from his dazzling cast of international starsÃ¢â‚¬â€from Mr. Holden and Miss Palmer, in the first place; from Ernst Schroder as the tangled German baron, Eva Dahlbeck as the wife of the hero, Wolfgang Preiss as a Luftwaffe colonel, and all the other actors and actresses right down the line.\nShot in color with a full Cook's tour of cities of Sweden, Germany and Denmark as locales, this film of Mr. Seaton and his associate, William Perlberg, is a &quot;must&quot; for the fans of spies, a near-&quot;must&quot; for armchair tourists and a nice heart-twister for those who list to love.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.07gb\nDuration.... 03:20:52\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 706\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 964kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 121kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06615eef040857388c0970be0d5f39d5f68218f7","amp;dn":"The+Counterfeit+Traitor+1962+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06615eef040857388c0970be0d5f39d5f68218f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,97,94,239,4,8,87,56,140,9,112,190,13,95,57,213,246,130,24,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
