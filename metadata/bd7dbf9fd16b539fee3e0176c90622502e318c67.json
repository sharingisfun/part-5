How can we live lives that are wise, compassionate, and in tune with reality? And how can we separate the wisdom of Buddhism from the cultural trappings and misconceptions that have come to be associated with it?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd7dbf9fd16b539fee3e0176c90622502e318c67","amp;dn":"Buddhism+Is+Not+What+You+Think%3A+Finding+Freedom+Beyond","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd7dbf9fd16b539fee3e0176c90622502e318c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,125,191,159,209,107,83,159,238,62,1,118,201,6,34,80,46,49,140,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
