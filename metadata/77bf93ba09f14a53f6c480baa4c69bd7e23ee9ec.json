The Mayles both revel in and endure what for most would be a fantasy experience: leaving dull jobs, acquiring an old farmhouse in Provence, and (for Peter) attempting to write a novel in the midst of bucolic countryside, gourmet food and drink, and interesting people. With an Agatha Christie-meets-To the Manor Born sensibility, the Mayles brave mistral winds, truffle season and the Mafia that surrounds it, exasperating neighbors, constant summer guests, an attempt at old-fashioned winemaking, and a Father Christmas drama--all while trying to renovate their kitchen.\n\nThis is not an in-depth look at expatriate living; rather, Mayle gives us a pastiche of the comedic situations he and his wife find themselves in. Some viewers may yearn for more shots of the scenic locations and a more serious treatment of ProvenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§al culture, but most will find this a whimsical adventure and an entertaining slice of fantasy meets reality.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77bf93ba09f14a53f6c480baa4c69bd7e23ee9ec","amp;dn":"A+Year+in+Provence+++%281993+-+John+Thaw+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77bf93ba09f14a53f6c480baa4c69bd7e23ee9ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,191,147,186,9,241,74,83,246,196,128,186,164,198,155,215,226,62,233,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
