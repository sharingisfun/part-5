Absolutely the finest of all versions of the venerable novel by Charles Dickens, and superb filmmaking on every conceivable level, with the definitive career performance from the great Ronald Colman. There's not a false note sounded among the literally hundreds of supporting performances. Truly one of the finest films of all time, the very definition of the term 'film classic,' and an honor to view whether it's the first or the hundred-and-first time you've seen it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96b04c089d85c72ad49c04979c0badb75059a531","amp;dn":"A+Tale+of+Two+Cities+%281935%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96b04c089d85c72ad49c04979c0badb75059a531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,176,76,8,157,133,199,42,212,156,4,151,156,11,173,183,80,89,165,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
