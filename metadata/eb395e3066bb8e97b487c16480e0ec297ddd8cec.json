Pellonpaa and Outinen&amp;#039;s understated, affecting performances complete each other, with valuable support from Sakari Kuosmanen as Melartin, Nikander&amp;#039;s best friend, who even steals from his own daughter to finance his buddy&amp;#039;s dates. Not that his behavior is exemplary, but it shows how much these people care for each other, and that&amp;#039;s where Kaurismaki succeeds: he makes us emphasize with these characters despite their many flaws, and delivers an astounding, memorable picture.\nA true masterpiece of Finnish film-making, from the best director that country has ever spawned (and of Europe if am i say)\n\nIMDB ID: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092149/\n\n\nFormat               : AVI\nFormat/Info          : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family        : RIFF\nFile size            : 696 MiB\nPlayTime             : 1h 10mn\nBit rate             : 1368 Kbps\nStreamSize           : 5.40 MiB\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : XviD\nCodec/Family         : MPEG-4\nCodec/Info           : XviD project\nCodec profile        : Simple Profile/Level 3\nCodec settings/Packe : No\nCodec settings/BVOP  : No\nCodec settings/QPel  : No\nCodec settings/GMC   : 0\nCodec settings/Matri : Default\nPlayTime             : 1h 10mn\nBit rate             : 1171 Kbps\nWidth                : 640 pixels\nHeight               : 336 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 1.905\nFrame rate           : 25.000 fps\nResolution           : 8 bits\nChroma               : 4:2:0\nInterlacement        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.216\nStreamSize           : 593 MiB\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : AC3\nPlayTime             : 1h 10mn\nBit rate             : 191 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : CBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nChannel positions    : L R\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz\nStreamSize           : 96.8 MiB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb395e3066bb8e97b487c16480e0ec297ddd8cec","amp;dn":"Aki+Kaurismaki+-+Shadows+In+Paradise+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb395e3066bb8e97b487c16480e0ec297ddd8cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,57,94,48,102,187,142,151,180,135,193,100,128,224,236,41,125,221,140,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
