At a time when his L.A. singer-songwriter peers were bleeding all over their puffy shirtsleeves with mawkish, sensitive balladry, Zevon turned the 1970s troubadour approach on its ear with a twisted lyrical sensibility that embraced danger, ribaldry, and general mayhem. The two-disc collection I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is an excellent introduction to Zevon's iconoclastic work.\n\nThe early years are well represented by the oddly poignant junkie's lament &quot;Carmelita&quot;, the horror-of-war ghost story &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot;, and of course, such misanthropic staples as &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; and &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;. I'll Sleep When I'm Dead stands to show, however, that the '70s weren't the end of Zevon's story. \n\nZevon is backed by R.E.M. on the trenchant boxing tale &quot;Boom Boom Mancini&quot; and admirably covers Prince's &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;. He humorously sums up his life as a rogue on &quot;Mr. Bad Example&quot;. &quot;Accidentally Like A Martyr&quot; is an austerely beautiful song and &quot;Splendid Isolation&quot; is a hymn to misanthropy. \n\nI'll Sleep When I'm Dead serves Zevon's legacy well. Songs like the incendiary &quot;Play It All Night Long&quot; and one of Zevon's finest meditations on life in L.A., &quot;Desperados Under the Eaves&quot; ensure that he won't be forgotten. \n\nPersonnel include: Warren Zevon (vocals, guitar, piano); Waddy Wachtel, Danny Kortchmar (guitar); Jim Horn (saxophone); Jai Winding (piano); John McVie (bass); Mick Fleetwood, Russ Kunkel, Jeff Porcaro (drums); Jackson Browne, Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Carl Wilson, Jorge Calderon, J.D.
