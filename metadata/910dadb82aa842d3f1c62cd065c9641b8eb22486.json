The full game, not the beta book.\nSorry, the quality ain't perfect but my scanner had better days.\n\nAnyways, didn't find the book anywhere so I put it up myself, but you really should buy the book if you want to GM. For players on the other hand it is nice with a .pdf, we all know that some people hog the rulebook and that an IPAD each is great when you make characters or so.\n\nNice game, I was critical about the dice first but I came around. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:910dadb82aa842d3f1c62cd065c9641b8eb22486","amp;dn":"edge+of+the+empire.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"910dadb82aa842d3f1c62cd065c9641b8eb22486","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,13,173,184,42,168,66,211,241,198,44,208,101,201,100,27,142,178,36,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
