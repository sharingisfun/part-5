Miles Davis' interpretation smoothes out the composer's lurching rhythms, his muted elaborations on the melody turning it into a mist rising up from the ground, until suddenly, almost exactly at the halfway mark, he blows a shrill fanfare and John Coltrane comes swaggering in for a rich, bluesy solo of his own. \nThe album feels like a real work of art, not a recording of five guys blowing through some tunes in a room. It's breathtaking how seamless it all is.\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœRound About Midnight\n\n1957\n\n\n  CD / 2001 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. 'Round Midnight \n\n2.
