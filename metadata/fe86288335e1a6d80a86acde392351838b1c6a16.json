Matters are complicated when he falls in love with Claire Trinavant, the last link to a forgotten family whose name strikes a mysteriously resonant chord.\n\nNight Of Error \nThe only discernable bond in the relationship of brothers Mark and Mike Trevelyan is their fascination with the sea and its secrets.

Mike has only two clues - a notebook in code and a lump of rock - enough to trigger off a hazardous expedition and a violent confrontation far from civilisation.\n\nRunning Blind \nIt all begins with a simple errand - a package to deliver. But for Alan Stewart, standing on a deserted road in Iceland with a murdered man at his feet, the mission looks far from simple. Set amongst some of the most dramatic scenery in the world, Stewart and his girlfriend, Erin, are faced with treacherous natural obstacles and deadly threats, as they battle to carry out the mission.

In dense jungle, he helps two archaeologists locate the rest of a fabled hoard of gold - treasure from Uaxuanoc, the centuries-old lost city of the Mayas.
