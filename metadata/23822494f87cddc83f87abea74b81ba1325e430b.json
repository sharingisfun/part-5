Like most Amiga magazines, the page count peaked in the\nearly-mid 90's, before dropping dramatically later in the decade. Amiga\nComputer finally ceased publication in 1997; short-lived US and Greek\neditions only lasted a few issues in 1995.\n\nThese PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on\npublic torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the\nmore unusual fonts and layouts used and by the relatively low DPI of the\nsource images. Some of the source page images were a bit odd too - I\nsuspect the originals came from more than one source.\n\nThe file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG\nimages; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible\nwithout losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\n(or Google RetroPDFs) for more\ninformation.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to\nRetroPDFs for their support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
