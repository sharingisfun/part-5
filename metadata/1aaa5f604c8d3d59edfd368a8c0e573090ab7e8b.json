It presents state-of-the-art methodological and technical solutions in the areas of in-vehicle architectures, multipartner development processes, software engineering methods, embedded communications, and safety and dependability assessment.\n\nDivided into four parts, the book begins with an introduction to the design constraints of automotive-embedded systems. It also examines AUTOSAR as the emerging de facto standard and looks at how key technologies, such as sensors and wireless networks, will facilitate the conception of partially and fully autonomous vehicles. The next section focuses on networks and protocols, including CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and TTCAN. The third part explores the design processes of electronic embedded systems, along with new design methodologies, such as the virtual platform. The final section presents validation and verification techniques relating to safety issues.\n\nProviding domain-specific solutions to various technical challenges, this handbook serves as a reliable, complete, and well-documented source \n\n\n# Hardcover: 488 pages\n# Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (December 20, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 084938026X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0849380266","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aaa5f604c8d3d59edfd368a8c0e573090ab7e8b","amp;dn":"Automotive+Embedded+Systems+Handbook%2C1st+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aaa5f604c8d3d59edfd368a8c0e573090ab7e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,170,95,96,76,141,61,89,237,253,54,138,140,14,87,48,144,171,126,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
