It covers anti-epileptic drugs and non-drug treatments, as well as self-management and living with epilepsy.\n\nEdited by a general practitioner and neurologist team, the ABC of Epilepsy reflects current NICE guidelines and is ideal for all GPs, primary health care professionals, practice nurses and specialist nurses, and non-specialist medical staff who play an increasing role in monitoring and managing of epilepsy patients.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adde973381dc841a1cb55e465d68a3462f2ff635","amp;dn":"ABC+of+Epilepsy+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adde973381dc841a1cb55e465d68a3462f2ff635","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,222,151,51,129,220,132,26,28,181,94,70,93,104,163,70,47,47,246,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
