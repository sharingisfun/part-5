He also worked for a French government railway before studying at the Academie Suisse in 1861. There, he met Paul Cezanne and Camille Pissarro with whom he maintained lifelong friendships. While he never achieved the stature of these two, his influence on their work was significant. Cezanne attempted his first etching based on Guillaumin paintings of barges on the River Seine.\n\nIn 1886 he became a friend of Vincent van Gogh whose brother, Theo sold some of his works. He was finally able to quit his government job and concentrate on painting full-time in 1891, when he won 100,000 francs in the state lottery.\n\nNoted for their intense colours, Guillamin's paintings are represented in major museums around the world. He is best remembered for his landscapes of Paris, the Creuse departement, and the area around Les Adrets-de-l'Esterel near the Mediterranean coast in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region of France. Guillamin was called the leader of the Ãƒâ€°cole de Crozant, a diverse group of painters who came to depict the landscape in the region of the Creuse around the village of Crozant. One of these depictions, titled Landscape in Crozant, is housed in the Chicago Institute of Arts. His bust is in the square near the village church","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cce13c050f448e518188a1a2dcfc1abdc22128d","amp;dn":"Armand+Guillaumin+%281841+%26ndash%3B+1927%29+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cce13c050f448e518188a1a2dcfc1abdc22128d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,206,19,192,80,244,72,229,24,24,138,26,45,207,193,171,220,34,18,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
