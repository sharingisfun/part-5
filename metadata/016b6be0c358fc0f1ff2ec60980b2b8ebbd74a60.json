If there is one flaw it is Barbirolli&amp;#039;s conducting; he almost loves the score too much, and his lingering occasionally makes you feel that the action lacks impetus. But the upside of that is the gorgeous orchestral detail; it&amp;#039;s easy to forget how well orchestrated this opera is, and Barbirolli reminds us.\nElsewhere the performance can&amp;#039;t be faulted: Renata Scotto was at the peak of her vocal powers in 1966, with beautiful pianissimos as well as every other dynamic, and a voice whose top had not yet turned acidic. As an interpretation, she gets Butterfly magnificently. She never overdoes the little-girlness, and the pathetic 18-year-old &quot;I-won&amp;#039;t-go-back-to-being-a-geisha&quot; monolog never dissolves into tears, but rather ends with a quiet, resigned, and utterly heartrending &quot;Morta!&quot;. Even in the final scene she refuses to cheapen with effects; her vocal color and phrasing tell the story perfectly.\n\n\nCarlo Bergonzi, too, is at his honeyed best, with the voice beautifully produced from top to bottom, and if he misses Gigli&amp;#039;s playfulness in Act 1, well, too bad: his last act is ravishing. Rolando Panerai&amp;#039;s Sharpless is well-drawn, and he&amp;#039;s very effective in the catastrophic second-act conversation with Butterfly. Anna di Stasio sings Suzuki sympathetically, blending well with Scotto in the Flower Duet. The sound is superb. This is a study in sadness that can&amp;#039;t be beat.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:016b6be0c358fc0f1ff2ec60980b2b8ebbd74a60","amp;dn":"Puccini+-+Madama+Butterfly+%28Scotto%2C+1966+EMI%29+%5B2CD%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"016b6be0c358fc0f1ff2ec60980b2b8ebbd74a60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,107,107,224,195,88,252,15,31,242,236,96,152,11,43,142,187,215,74,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
