Philly native, DJ Drama cleverly borrows Disturbing Tha Peace&amp;#039;s, A-town anthem which speaks volumes for the impressive level of creativity expressed throughout Dedication 2 (Gangsta Grillz). The Holigrove, Cash Money, Young Money representa, offers a personal reflection regarding his political angst and grand affection for his Hurricane Katrina deposed home. Weezy F. Baby aka independently voted &quot;The President&quot; and DJ Drama&amp;#039;s Dedication 2 (D2) is an energized and poignant, music extravaganza for all Hip-Hop fans.\n\nD2 features many highpoints, lyrically and musically, just in time for summer. The southern bounce inspired, &quot;Get Em&quot; sets off the 25 track jambalaya. &quot;Cannon (AMG Edition)&quot; hints to the diversity found throughout the musical medley. With steady horns laced under Wayne&amp;#039;s almost seamless flow, he leads an impressive group of strong lyricist, including Freeway, Willie the Kid, Detroit Red and Juice. &quot;Cannon (AMG Edition)&quot; can easily be a contender for a new-age Hip-Hop classic.\n\nWith Weezy offering his own take over so many hits, snagging instrumentals from Dem Franchize Boyz (&quot;They Still Like Me&quot;) to T.I. (&quot;What U Kno&quot;), D2 does not disappoint. &quot;Sportscenter&quot; deserves special attention. Not only does the bass driven track, entice a sincere &quot;lean back&quot; moment, Wayne?s lyrical delivery is glossy. He opens with, &quot;Cover my tracks like butter so where the bread be/I see beef as dead meat.&quot; Post the Carter II, a confident, rightfully so, Weezy glides over the track like the veteran he is-even if he is only 23-years old.\n\nAside from Lil Wayne&amp;#039;s own solid lyrical performance, he shares the mic with Hip-Hop heavy weights. &quot;Welcome to tha Concrete Jungle&quot; opens with Juelz Santana, who appears again on &quot;No Other&quot;. Sharing most of the collaboration time is Lil Wayne&amp;#039;s, Young Money artists, Currency and Mac Maine. &quot;Poppin Them Bottle&quot; and &quot;Ridin Wit the AK&quot; are the most notable tracks featuring the trio. Remy Martin is featured on the slick, &quot;Where the Cash A and Pharell, the chameleon, appears on &quot;Gettin Some Head&quot;.\n\nLil Wayne and Hip-Hop aficionado DJ Drama is a proven team. The streets, any street from N.O. to Philly to N.Y. to L.A. can &quot;bounce&quot;, &quot;snap&quot;, &quot;lean back&quot; or &quot;gangsta boogie&quot; to this explosive second journey, Dedication 2. \n\n-----\n\nTracklist:\n\n# Best In The Business\n# Get Em\n# They Still Like Me\n# I&amp;#039;m The Best Rapper Alive\n# Cannon (AMG Remix) Ft.
