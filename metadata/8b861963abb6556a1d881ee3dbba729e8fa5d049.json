Like every one of his previous two big catalog shifts -- a campaign with Rykodisc/Demon in 1994, a jump to Rhino in 2001 -- the 2007 series is preceded by a new hits collection, this time The Best of Elvis Costello: The First 10 Years, a 22-track collection of highlights that's pretty much exactly what it says it is. It is quite similar to the last previous single-disc collection, the 1994 Ryko/Demon set The Very Best of Elvis Costello and the Attractions, which also ran 22 tracks, 19 of which also appear on The First 10 Years. The three omissions -- &quot;Watch Your Step,&quot; &quot;New Amsterdam,&quot; and &quot;Love Field&quot; -- will not be missed by anybody looking for a new Costello comp in 2007, particularly because all three substitutions are better choices for the casual man: &quot;New Lace Sleeves,&quot; &quot;Almost Blue,&quot; and &quot;(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes,&quot; which bizarrely wasn't on the 1994 set. With these three songs rubbing shoulders with &quot;Alison,&quot; &quot;Watching the Detectives,&quot; &quot;Pump It Up,&quot; &quot;Oliver's Army,&quot; &quot;(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love &amp; Understanding,&quot; and all the other usual suspects, The Best of Elvis Costello: The First 10 Years winds up being the best single-disc summary and introduction to Costello's prime years. - All Music Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine  \n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] (The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes\n[02] Alison\n[03] Watching The Detectives\n[04] (I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea\n[05] Pump It Up\n[06] Radio, Radio\n[07] Accidents Will Happen\n[08] Oliver's Army\n[09] (What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love &amp; Understanding\n[10] I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down\n[11] High Fidelity\n[12] Clubland\n[13] New Lace Sleeves\n[14] Good Year For The Roses\n[15] Beyond Belief\n[16] Man Out Of Time\n[17] Almost Blue\n[18] Everyday I Write The Book\n[19] Shipbuilding\n[20] Brilliant Mistake\n[21] Indoor Fireworks\n[22] I Want You\n\n\tCD Play Time - 01h:18m:37s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 199mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
