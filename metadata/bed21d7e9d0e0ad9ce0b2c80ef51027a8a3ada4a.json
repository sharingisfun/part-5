Like a tear in the fabric of the Silver Screen, Umebayashi somehow manages to evoke the romance of old Hollywood, the unpredictability of French cinema, and the sinewy world of David Lynch with both confidence and fluidity. Even the selections by other artists (Connie Francis, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole) sound as if they were coaxed out of the film as opposed to being inserted in it. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Umebayashi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Umebayashi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nmp3 128 k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed21d7e9d0e0ad9ce0b2c80ef51027a8a3ada4a","amp;dn":"2046+Soundtrack+-+2004+%28128%29+Shigeru+Umebayashi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed21d7e9d0e0ad9ce0b2c80ef51027a8a3ada4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,210,29,126,157,14,10,217,206,11,44,128,239,81,2,122,138,58,218,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
