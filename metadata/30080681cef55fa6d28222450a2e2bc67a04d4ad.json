Infotainment and navigation systems, diagnostics, WiFi, software assisted steering, and other innovations form a complex network that helps make driving a breeze. But these innovations also expose all modern vehicles to new attacks by malicious hackers that jeopardize the safety and security of millions of vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe Car Hacker's Handbook is a guide for the security-minded that shows how to identify network security risks, exploit software vulnerabilities, and gain a deeper understanding of the software running in our vehicles. Along the way you'll learn how navigation systems can be hacked to take control of vehicles, how systems are interconnected, even how to bypass dealership restrictions to diagnose and troubleshoot problems.\r\n\r\nThis book is a technical manual for hackers, as well as a wake-up call for legislators and car manufacturers. In order to build vehicles with safe and secure software, you need to know what's exposed.\r\n\r\nBut you don't have to be a mechanic or know much about automotive electronic systems to understand vehicle software security. If you're curious about cyber security, and want to hack a two ton computer on wheels, The Car Hacker's Handbook should be your first stop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30080681cef55fa6d28222450a2e2bc67a04d4ad","amp;dn":"The+Car+Hacker%27s+Handbook+%282016%29+%28Pdf%2C+Epub+and+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30080681cef55fa6d28222450a2e2bc67a04d4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,8,6,129,206,245,95,166,210,130,34,69,10,46,43,198,122,4,212,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
