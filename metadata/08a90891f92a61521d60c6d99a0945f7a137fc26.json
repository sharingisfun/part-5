It introduced music lovers the world over to Christopher Hogwood, Emma Kirkby, and a whole host of performers who have since become ubiquitous as the 'English Early Music Mafia,' appearing as they do under zillions of different ensemble names on a variety of labels. Hogwood's performance still holds its own, however, as one of the finest and freshest available. A first-rate effort.&quot;\n--David Hurwitz &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Handel-Messiah-Watkinson-Elliott-Hogwood/dp/B000004CXU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Handel-Messiah-Watkinson-Elliott-Hogwood/dp/B000004CXU&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------------------\nDisc: 1\n\n1.
