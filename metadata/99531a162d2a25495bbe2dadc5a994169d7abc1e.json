The guru to aspiring stand-up comics provides the complete scoop on being -- and writing -- funny for money. \n\nIf you've got a sense of humor, you can learn to make a career out of comedy, says Judy Carter. Whether it's creating a killer stand-up act, writing a spec sitcom, or providing jokes for radio or one-liners for greeting cards, Carter provides step-by-step instructions in The Comedy Bible. She helps readers first determine which genre of comedy writing or performing suits them best and then directs them in developing, refining, and selling their work. \n\nUsing the hands-on workbook format that was so effective in her bestselling first book, Stand-Up Comedy: The Book, Carter offers a series of day-by-day exercises that draw on her many years as a successful stand-up comic and the head of a nationally known comedy school. Also included are practical tips and advice from today's top comedy professionals -- from Bernie Brillstein to Christopher Titus to Richard Lewis. She presents the pros and cons of the various comedy fields -- stand-up, script, speech and joke writing, one-person shows, humor essays -- and shows how to tailor your material for each. She teaches how to find your &quot;authentic&quot; voice -- the true source of comedy. And, perhaps most important, Carter explains how to take a finished product to the next level -- making money -- by pitching it to a buyer and negotiating a contract. \n\nWritten in Carter's unique, take-no-prisoners voice, The Comedy Bible is practical, inspirational, and funny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99531a162d2a25495bbe2dadc5a994169d7abc1e","amp;dn":"The+Comedy+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99531a162d2a25495bbe2dadc5a994169d7abc1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,83,26,22,45,42,37,73,91,190,45,173,197,169,148,22,157,122,188,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
