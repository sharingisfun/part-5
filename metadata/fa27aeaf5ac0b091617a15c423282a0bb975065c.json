Author Ray Villalobos first introduces the fundamentals, such as checking to see if a user is logged into an application, accessing Facebook user data through the Open Graph API, and making complex API calls with the Graph API Explorer. The course then dives into building an application with API paths and Facebook Query Language (FQL) calls. Along the way, you'll discover how to post to a user's wall, upload photos, integrate with webpages, and more.\nTopics include:\nDownloading and installing the PHP SDK\nLogging in and authenticating users\nAccessing Open Graph data\nWorking with connection subpaths, limits, and subsearches\nStyling a Facebook app with CSS\nSetting up pagination\nUnderstanding Facebook Query Language (FQL)\nIntegrating query results into a full-scale application","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa27aeaf5ac0b091617a15c423282a0bb975065c","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Building+Facebook+Applications+with+PHP+and+MySQL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa27aeaf5ac0b091617a15c423282a0bb975065c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,39,174,175,90,192,176,145,97,122,21,196,35,40,42,11,185,117,6,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
