Sir Alex Ferguson drove United on to their record breaking 20th League title, and his 13th and ultimately final Premier League crown.\n\nAfter almost 27 years in charge, Sir Alex shocked the world of football with his decision to retire. Fittingly he leaves United at the top. Champions yet again and this triumph was as thrilling and comprehensive as any before it. Inspired by the goal scoring genius of Robin van Persie, the might and majesty of Michael Carrick, the defensive dominance of Rio Ferdinand and the emergence of David De Gea as the best young keeper in the country, the Reds roared back in style after missing out so cruelly on the final day last season. \n\nA United squad of youthful brilliance and experienced excellence beat all their major rivals with dramatic late victories at both Manchester City and Chelsea among the most exhilarating moments of an unforgettable campaign. Featuring every goal from every game, exclusive interviews and all the emotion of Sir Alex s final match at the Theatre of Dreams.
