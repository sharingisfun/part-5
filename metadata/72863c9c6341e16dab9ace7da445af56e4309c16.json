In the process, Bourne begins to question \nwho he really is and what he would become if he no longer carried the \nBourne identity.\n\nAcross the globe, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt \n- apparently by an Iranian missile - leaving the world wondering if \nit was an accident or an act of aggression. A massive global team, lead \nby Soraya Moore, is assembled to investigate the attack before the situation \nescalates.\n\nWhen Bourne's search for his would-be assassin intersects with Soraya's \nsearch for the group behind the airplane bombing, Bourne is thrust into \na race to prevent a new world war. But it may already be too late","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72863c9c6341e16dab9ace7da445af56e4309c16","amp;dn":"Robert+Ludlum+%28Bourne+09%29+-+The+Bourne+Dominion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72863c9c6341e16dab9ace7da445af56e4309c16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,134,60,156,99,65,225,109,171,154,206,125,164,69,175,86,228,48,156,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
