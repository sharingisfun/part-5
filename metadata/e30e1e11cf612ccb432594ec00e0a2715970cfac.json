Not knowing how to achieve the joyful and satisfying lives they desire, they're stuck accepting a lifestyle of emotional trauma, chronic physical pain, compulsions and addictions, or perhaps just an empty feeling inside. Along with these problems come pills to kill the pain, sleep at night, and suppress anxiety Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but this is hardly better than the disease.\n\nIf you're like many people, you feel trapped, caught in this cycle. You're tired of feeling sad, depressed, anxious, discontent, and unwell. You're sick of the expensive and ineffective treatments. You're fed up with relinquishing the power over your health and happiness to psychologists and doctors. You'd like to grow, flourish, and thrive, putting the past in the past. You want to be your best, living a life that is filled with peacefulness, joy, and fulfillment, from day to day and moment to moment.\n\nWith Tapping, you can do that. You can discover the vital secret for emotional wholeness and physical relief. You can take your physical and emotional well-being into your own hands. It's simple for anyone to master.\n\nWebsite: http://thetappingsolution.com/the-film.php\n\nINCLUDED IN THIS COLLECTION\nThe Tapping Solution DVD Rip (xvid format)\nThe Tapping Solution DVD cover (png format)\nThe Tapping Solution DVD subtitles (srt format)\nThe Tapping Solution Audio Book (mp3 format)\nThe Tapping Solution eBook (epub format)\nTapping scripts referred to in the book (pdf format)\nTapping demonstrations and interviews (avi format)\n\nVIDEO INFORMATION\nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile: Advanced Simple@L4\nFormat settings, BVOP: 2\nFormat settings, QPel: No\nFormat settings, GMC: No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix: Default (MPEG)\nCodec ID: DIVX\nDuration: 1h 24mn\nBit rate: 1 500 Kbps\nWidth: 720 pixels\nHeight: 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9\nFrame rate: 29.970 fps\nColor space: YUV\nChroma subsampling: 4:2:0\nBit depth: 8 bits\nScan type: Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.174\nStream size: 907 MiB (88%)\nWriting library: XviD 64\n\nAUDIO INFORMATION\nFormat: MPEG Audio\nFormat version: Version 1\nFormat profile: Layer 3\nCodec ID: 55\nCodec ID/Hint: MP3\nDuration: 1h 24mn\nBit rate mode: Constant\nBit rate: 192 Kbps\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode: Lossy\nStream size: 116 MiB (11%)\nAlignment: Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration: 26 ms (0.78 video frame)\nWriting library: LAME3.99\n\nThis is powerfully healing stuff.
