In addition to drumming duties, Peart also took on the job of lyricist by default, leading the band to adopt a more literary lyrical style that differed significantly from the debut album. The songs &quot;By-Tor &amp; the Snow Dog&quot; and &quot;Rivendell&quot; are examples of the inclusion of fantasy themes into Rush's music.\n\n&quot;By-Tor &amp; the Snow Dog&quot; was inspired by Rush roadie Howard Ungerleider's story of him staying at Anthem records manager Ray Danniels' house, where Danniels' German Shepherd growled at him, and a tiny dog also owned by Danniels tried to jump on him. Ungerleider told Rush about it and they thought it was hilarious.\n\n&quot;Anthem&quot; features lyrics inspired by elements of the philosophy of Ayn Rand, whose influence on Peart's writing would reach its apogee on Rush's 1976 album 2112. The autobiographical title track is based on Peart's experience of briefly moving from Canada to London as a young musician (before joining Rush). The original hand-penned lyrics for both &quot;Anthem&quot; and &quot;Fly by Night&quot; include different or additional lyrics not sung in the original songs. The original lyrics to &quot;Fly by Night&quot; include a prologue which is not found in the final song.\n\nThe song &quot;By-Tor &amp; the Snow Dog&quot; at the end of side one of the original LP has a recording of jingle sounds which continues into the locked groove and thus plays indefinitely on manual record players.\n\nTrack Listing [Remastered] [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Anthem&quot;   \t4:10\n2. \t&quot;Best I Can&quot; (Lee) \t3:24\n3. \t&quot;Beneath, Between &amp; Behind&quot; (Music: Lifeson) \t3:00\n4. \t&quot;By-Tor &amp; the Snow Dog\n    I. &quot;At the Tobes of Hades&quot; - 0:34\n    II. &quot;Across the Styx&quot; - 0:35\n    III. &quot;Of The Battle&quot; - 6:14\n        a. &quot;Challenge and Defiance&quot; - 1:04\n        b. &quot;7/4 War Furor&quot; - 1:07\n        c. &quot;Aftermath&quot; - 2:06\n        d. &quot;Hymn of Triumph&quot; - 1:57\n    IV. &quot;Epilogue&quot; - 1:14&quot;  \n5. \t&quot;Fly by Night&quot; (Music: Lee) \t3:20\n6. \t&quot;Making Memories&quot;   \t2:56\n7. \t&quot;Rivendell&quot; (Lee) \t5:00\n8. \t&quot;In the End&quot; (Lee, Lifeson) \t6:51","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed89176f61d141bb5003cf4f5ef63cd0ef387ce","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Fly+By+Night+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed89176f61d141bb5003cf4f5ef63cd0ef387ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,216,145,118,246,29,20,27,181,0,60,244,245,239,99,205,14,243,135,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
