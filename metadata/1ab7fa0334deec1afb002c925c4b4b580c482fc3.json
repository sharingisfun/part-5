Arthur discovers that the key to success lies in his own descent into the land of the Minimoys, creatures no larger than a tooth, whom his grandfather helped relocate to their garden. Somewhere among them is hidden a pile of rubies, too. Can Arthur be of stout heart and save the day? Romance beckons as well, and a villain lurks.\n\nFormat : Matroska at 1800 Kbps\nLength : 1 GiB for 1h 39mn 31s 40ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 1272 Kbps\nAspect : 720 x 304 (2.368) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : ell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab7fa0334deec1afb002c925c4b4b580c482fc3","amp;dn":"Arthur+and+the+Minimoys+2006+Greek+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab7fa0334deec1afb002c925c4b4b580c482fc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,183,250,3,52,222,236,26,251,0,44,146,92,75,75,88,12,72,47,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
