That this mystery lies behind everything from 9/11 to the collapse of the global economy? That ancient harbingers of judgment are now manifesting in America? That God is sending America a prophetic message of what is yet to come? Before its end as a nation, there appeared in ancient Israel nine specific warnings and omens of national destruction - these same Nine Harbingers are now manifesting in America with profound ramifications for AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future and end-time prophecy.\n\nHidden in an ancient biblical prophecy from Isaiah, the mysteries revealed in The Harbinger are so precise that they foretell recent American events down to the exact days: the 3,000-year-old mystery that revealed the exact date of the stock market collapse of 2008Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the ancient prophecy that was proclaimed from the floor of the US Senate and then came trueÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and more. The revelations are so specific that even the most hardened skeptic will find it hard to put down. Though it sounds like the plot of a Hollywood thriller - ITÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S REAL.\n\nThe prophetic mysteries are factual but revealed through a riveting narrative the reader will find hard to put down. The Harbinger opens with the appearance of a man burdened with a message he has received from a mysterious figure called The Prophet. The Prophet has given him nine seals, each containing a message about America's future. As he tells of his encounters with the Prophet, from a skyscraper in New York City to a rural mountaintop to Capitol Hill to Ground Zero, the mystery behind each seal is revealed. As the story unfolds, each revelation becomes another piece in a larger and larger puzzle, the ramifications of which are, even now, altering the course of America and the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57913d9210e5b5565406a7db3fe892cb21089ce","amp;dn":"The+Harbinger+-+Jonathan+Cahn+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57913d9210e5b5565406a7db3fe892cb21089ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,121,19,217,33,14,91,85,101,64,106,125,179,254,137,44,178,16,137,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
