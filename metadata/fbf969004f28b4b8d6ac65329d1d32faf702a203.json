While this\nfirst attempt at cracking the new protection, it seemed to\nwork at first, but soon you will notice that you can't\nadvance through the game campaigns. The game stays in this\nfrozen like state so no matter what you do it will remain\nunchanged. You can't complete your objectives and then\ngain new ones like you should which makes this game\nunplayable at that time and needing a proper crack.\nViTALiTY is here to present an alternative crack to this\nnew protection, one which doesn't require server emulation\nand allows you full access to the games features. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbf969004f28b4b8d6ac65329d1d32faf702a203","amp;dn":"Silent.Hunter.5.Battle.of.the.Atlantic.PROPER.READNFO-ViTALiTY-%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbf969004f28b4b8d6ac65329d1d32faf702a203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,249,105,0,79,40,180,184,214,172,101,50,157,29,50,250,247,2,162,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
