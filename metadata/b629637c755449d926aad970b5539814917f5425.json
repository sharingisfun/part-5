Defeating the corrupt tyrants entrenched there will require not only strength, but leadership, as Ezio commands an entire Brotherhood that will rally to his side. Only by working together can the Assassins defeat their mortal enemies.\n\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood offers a never-before-seen multiplayer layer. Players can help the Templars by using Abstergo to train in the art of Assassination to eliminate the Assassins once and for all. Players can choose from a wide range of unique characters, each with their own signature weapons and assassination techniques, and match their skills against other players from all over the world in different game modes.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMinimum Configuration:\nSUPPORTED OS: WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP (32-64 bits) /Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®(32-64 bits) /Windows 7Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® (32-64 bits)\nProcessor: Intel CoreÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2 Duo 1.8 GHZ or AMD Athlon X2 64 2.4GHZ\nRAM: 1.5 GB  WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP / 2 GB Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® - Windows 7Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®\nVideo Card: 256 MB DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®  9.0compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher (see supported list)\nSound Card: DirectX 9.0 compliant sound card\nDirectX Version: DirectX 9.0\nDVD-ROM: DVD-ROM dual-layer drive\nHard Drive Space: 8 GB\nPeripherals Supported: Keyboard, mouse, optional controller\n\n* This product does not support WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 98/ME/2000/NT\n\n\nRecommended Configuration:\nProcessor: Intel CoreÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2 Duo E6700 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ or better\nVideo Card: GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 8800 GT or ATI RadeonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® HD 4700  or better\nSound: 5.1 sound card\nPeripherals: Keyboard, mouse, joystick optional (Xbox 360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Controller for Windows recommended)\n \n\nSupported Video Cards at Time of Release:\nATIÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RADEONÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® HD 2000/3000/4000/5000/6000 series\nNVIDIA GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 8/9/100/200/300/400/500 series\n\n Laptop versions of these cards may work but are NOT supported.

With the Windows drivers, you may need to remap the Up/Down axis\n of the right stick through the in-game options menu for it to work properly.\n\n* ATI Eye Infinity and Matrox TripleHead2Go\n These peripherals are supported in the singleplayer mode but not in multiplayer.\n\n* MadCatz Modern Warfare controller\n To use this pad, install the madcatz, saitek software. Then use the pad in-game\n with a mouse/keyboard configuration. (the madcatz, saitek software emulates a mouse\n and keyboard)\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.madcatz.com/Default.asp?Page=213&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.madcatz.com/Default.asp?Page=213&lt;/a&gt;\n It works as a keyboard mouse emulator instead of native gamepad controls.\n\n* Generic controllers display problem in Hud and Menu\n On some controllers with letter buttons, the game will display them as numbers using\n DirectInput.\n\n* If using Realtek High Definition Audio, Soundmax HD Audio, or nForce Audio, you\n may experience sound anomalies. To work around the problem, reduce the Hardware\n acceleration slider to 'Basic' in the Windows Control Panel -&gt; Sounds and Audio\n Devices -&gt; Audio tab -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Performance tab.\n\n* Some SFX are playing too loud when the sfx setting is at 1.\n\n* If using an AMD dual-core processor, you may experience fast flickering of the\n in-game menu items. To work around this problem, install the AMD Dual-Core\n Optimizer available on the AMD web site (see section 3.2).\n\n* If you experience graphical corruption, make sure your graphics driver's\n control panel is _not_ configured to override application settings.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/51072100264261601903.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/51072100264261601903.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/03043693733555424726.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/03043693733555424726.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b629637c755449d926aad970b5539814917f5425","amp;dn":"Assassin%5C%27s+Creed+Brotherhood+-+CloneDVD+-+Multi+11%7EDiBYA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b629637c755449d926aad970b5539814917f5425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,41,99,124,117,84,73,217,38,170,217,112,181,83,152,20,145,127,84,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
