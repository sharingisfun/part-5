Lechter CPA, Michael Bernard Beckwith and Mark Victor Hansen\nMP3 FORMAT (5 CDs, Unabridged)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1454900679/4353-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1454900679/4353-20&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUsing his legendary ability to get to the root of human potential, Napoleon Hill digs deep to reveal how fear, procrastination, anger, and jealousy prevent us from realizing our personal goals. This long-suppressed parable, once considered too controversial to publish, was written by Hill in 1938 following the publication of his classic bestseller, Think and Grow Rich. Annotated and edited for a contemporary audience by Rich Dad, Poor Dad and Three Feet from Gold co-author Sharon Lechter, this book--now available in paper--is profound, powerful, resonant, and rich with insight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff11b660a4f8bd1bc605771b31659070aeff546","amp;dn":"NAPOLEON+HILL+-+Outwitting+the+Devil+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff11b660a4f8bd1bc605771b31659070aeff546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,241,27,102,10,79,139,209,188,96,87,113,179,22,89,7,10,239,245,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
