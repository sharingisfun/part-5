Yes, time never stops, and all our lives are but a journey through the relentless ticks of time.\nWhat is time? How do we measure it? Can we manipulate it? Such questions have attracted the attention of scientists, philosophers and writers through thousands of years.\nThroughout life, we are all traveling a one-way path through time, heading to the future. But can we take a turn and move backwards in time? Or, can we take a double-leap and take a peep into the future?
