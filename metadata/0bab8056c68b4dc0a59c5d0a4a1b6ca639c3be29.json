There are only the alternate versions of the existing stations of GTA IV, as well as the new ones.\n\nSome stations are a mix, some consist of a mix and stand-alone tracks, others are only split up tracks. I included all I had, and tagged everything so it would be consistent.\nAlso included, all the news, commercials, host interventions (sometimes separated into 2 sets, coming from TBGT or TLAD), weather reports.\nAlso included, the loading and menu tracks for the whole and both of the episodes.\nAlso included, the mix we can hear at Hercules' gay club.\n\nEnjoy! And seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bab8056c68b4dc0a59c5d0a4a1b6ca639c3be29","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+IV+%28GTA+4%29+-+Episodes+From+Liberty+City+-+OST+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bab8056c68b4dc0a59c5d0a4a1b6ca639c3be29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,171,128,86,198,139,77,192,165,156,93,10,74,27,108,166,57,195,190,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
