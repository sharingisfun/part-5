After stressing the significance of spoken language, along with art and technology, Diamond focuses on the self-destructive propensities of our species to kill each other (genocide and drug abuse) and to destroy the environment (mass extinctions). He also discusses human sexuality, geographic variability, and ramifications of agriculture (metallurgy, cultivated plants, and domesticated animals). Absent from Diamond's work is the role religion plays in causing both war and the population explosion as well as long-range speculations on the future of our species. This informative, most fascinating, and very readable book is highly recommended for all libraries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b808da42898fa161aa1e21839296c1bab0ce095","amp;dn":"Jared+Diamond+The+Third+Chimpanzee+The+Evolution+and+Future+of+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b808da42898fa161aa1e21839296c1bab0ce095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,128,141,164,40,152,250,22,26,161,226,24,57,41,108,27,171,12,224,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
