At this time the hersir was typically an independent landowner or local chieftain with equipment superior to that of his followers. By the end of the 10th century, the independence of the hersir was gone, and he was now a regional servant of the Norwegian king. This book investigates these brutal, mobile warriors, and examines their tactics and psychology in war, dispelling the idea of the Viking raider as simply a killing machine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d78cc665cc6676bfb6a5d9f02e0926456ff0532d","amp;dn":"Viking+Hersir+793-1066+AD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d78cc665cc6676bfb6a5d9f02e0926456ff0532d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,140,198,101,204,102,118,191,182,165,217,240,46,9,38,69,111,240,83,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
