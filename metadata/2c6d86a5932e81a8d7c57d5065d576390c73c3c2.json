His most recent project is a mixtape titled The Water[s].\n\nIn July 2014, Mick has been receiving a lot of attention after the release of his single/visual Martyrs which \njuxtaposes harsh truths about our society with a catchy hook, creating a thought-provoking single with various \nunderlying messages and subtle notions. Martyrs has led people such as Timberland, among others, to reach out \nand praise Jenkins for his musical talent and intricate lyricism. Mick continues to find creative ways to convey \nhis message and on August 12 released his highly anticipated project The Water[s] which has garnered national \nattention. Centered around the idea of comparing water to life's truths, The Water[s] serves as Jenkins' breakout \nproject and is receiving critical acclaim. Shortly after releasing the project, Jenkins announced he would \nbe touring during the fall on the 2014 Smoker's Club World Wide Roller's Tour along with Method Man, Redman, \nBerner, and B-Real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           We pillage, we plunder we rifle and loot\n                It's a pirate's life for me\n                   Drink up, me hearties\n\t\t\t\n                       _____|____\n                      | Ph1l0s0phy|\n\t\t      |     1s    |\n\t\t      |\t   D34d   |\n                      |.----||----.\n                        .---''---,\n                         ;..__..'    _...\n                       ,'/  ;|/..--''    \n                     ,'_/.-/':            :\n                _..-'''/  /  |         _|/|\n                     /-./_ ;       ,;'   \n               ,    / :  `:       //    `:`.\n             ,'    /-._;   | :    : ::    ,.   .\n           ,'     ::   /`-._| |    | || ' :  `.`.)\n        _,'       |;._:: |  | |    | `|   :    `'\n      ,'   `.     /   |`-:_ ; |    |  |  : \n      `--.   )   /|-._:    :          |    \n         /  /   :_|   ;`-._;   __..--';    : :\n        /  (    ;|;-./_  _/.-:'o |   /     ' |\n       /  , ._/_/_./--''/_|:|___|_,'        |\n      :  /   `'-'--'----'---------'          |\n      | :     O ._O   O_.
