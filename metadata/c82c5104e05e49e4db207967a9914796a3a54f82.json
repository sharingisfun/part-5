I will only be seeding this version from now on.\n\nBilly Gibbons\n\nBilly Gibbons is a founding member and guitarist for the famed Texas blues-rock band ZZ Top with bassist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard, who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. The band, formed in Houston in 1969, boasts seven platinum and 11 gold records, selling more than 25 million in U.S. album sales alone.\n\nDaryl and Billy launch into a remarkably diverse seven-song set of Daryl Hall and John Oates and ZZ Top chestnuts along with a vintage cover of Hammond B-3 jazz-blues organist Jimmy McGriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1963 instrumental, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kiko.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The pair also perform such deep Daryl Hall tunes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bank on Your Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song from Daryl Hall and John Oates' hit album, Big Bam Boom and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love You Like a Brother,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ recorded in 1973, but unreleased until 1977Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Atlantic Records hits compilation, No Goodbyes. The twosome lean into four ZZ Top nuggets, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover of Sam &amp; DaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Thank You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the 1979 album Deguello; the classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“La Grange,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ included on 1973Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Tres Hombres; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sharp Dressed ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1983Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s 10-million-selling Eliminator, and the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version of the NightcapsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s rave-up, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thunderbird.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Playing Live from DarylÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s House is a regular, down-to-earth, big bash,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Gibbons about the experience. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good groovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to the core.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Being in a room with Billy Gibbons is like dipping your toe into the deep wellspring of Texas rock, blues and soul,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Daryl.
