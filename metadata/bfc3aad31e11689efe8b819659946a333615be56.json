Although he does what he considers best for his students, they don't much like him, nicknaming him &quot;Ditchy&quot;, short for &quot;dull as ditch water&quot;. His life changes when he meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall actress and a woman with a questionable past. She affectionately calls him Mr. Chips. Despite their differences, they fall in love. He in particular realizes that in striking a relationship, they will have many obstacles to overcome. He doesn't particularly like the world in which she is involved, including her friends and her profession, and she doesn't exactly fit the mold of a teacher's wife. Still, they decide to get married. She forgoes her career to be Mrs. Chips, living on campus as the housewife of a teacher at a proper boy's school. It is a world in which she will have to learn the rules, or at least bend them to her sensibilities, although she vows never to embarrass him. Katherine's arrival at Brookfield may change Chips' standing at the school. Further changes ensue for the Chips' and Brookfield with the onset of World War II.  \n\nDirected by Herbert Ross. With Peter O'Toole, Petula Clark, Michael Redgrave.\n\n\nEnjoy! ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc3aad31e11689efe8b819659946a333615be56","amp;dn":"Goodbye+Mr.+Chips+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfc3aad31e11689efe8b819659946a333615be56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,195,170,211,30,17,104,158,254,139,129,150,89,148,106,51,54,21,190,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
