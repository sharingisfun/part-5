If questions are too hard, you could over-practice and loose confidence. Too easy, and you would be unprepared. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take chances. Trust the Wiley Test BankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proven success in matching practice sessions to exams.\n\nBetter Technology ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best of both worlds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you get access to updated, online content plus the ability to use the Test Bank on your PC or Mac offline without an internet connection. As of June 2012 a new Offline Player has been added via a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Download CenterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in CPATestBank.com. See the CPATestBank.com &amp; CD-ROM Comparison below for more details (the CD-ROM contains the same Offline Player as the Download Center).\n\nImproved Reporting shows student progress by topic, and which topics have reached passing threshold. Students can customize reports by including/excluding saved sessions. Progress reports can be filtered by subject, viewed as raw score or percents and more!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a474dd55ec597c6699aaacce66c9ff33691eef32","amp;dn":"Wiley+CPA+Exam+Review+Test+Bank+CD+-+Desktop+Installation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a474dd55ec597c6699aaacce66c9ff33691eef32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,116,221,85,236,89,124,102,153,170,172,206,102,201,255,51,105,30,239,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
