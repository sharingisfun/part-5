Enclave Radio - Yankee Doodle\t\t\t\t\t     1:12\n-------------------------------------Info/Comments-------------------------------\nWell, these are the 8 songs that play on Enclave Radio. They&amp;#039;re all at a constant bitrate of 128kbps. If you want to help seed assuming you already have this from extracting the bsa file just rename all the songs to the ones above. You may or may not have to change the genre to &quot;Other&quot; on all the songs. I&amp;#039;m not completely certain on that.\n\nI&amp;#039;m currently seeking Artist and Song names from Violin and Vault 101. If you have some info on that please send me an e-mail and you&amp;#039;ll receive credit for giving me the song and artist names when I get around to completing it and assuming no one beats me to it.\n\nSeed, seed, seed. Upload to other places if you&amp;#039;d like. I&amp;#039;m not saying that it&amp;#039;s that enjoyable but still, there&amp;#039;s some people who have a taste in this kind of music or perhaps they&amp;#039;re just looking for these songs in particular for some personal uses. Whatever the reason, the point still remains... SEED!\n\nFor those Galaxy News Radio Fans, you should check out my other torrent in case you haven&amp;#039;t and just in case you&amp;#039;re looking for the soundtrack of Galaxy News Radio as many are. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4547695\n\nSpecial Thanks to Enricksolt on YouTube for listing all the song names in your video description with all the Enclave Radio songs. Even if it was unintentional, you still have my thanks.\n\npenguincomrade[at]gmail[dot]com\nYour Friendly Neighbourhood Penguin,\nPenguin Comrade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51353a93c9cc828e32f52206bd81ab4b5fcd1a28","amp;dn":"Fallout+3+-+Enclave+Radio+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51353a93c9cc828e32f52206bd81ab4b5fcd1a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,53,58,147,201,204,130,142,50,245,34,6,189,129,171,75,95,205,26,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
