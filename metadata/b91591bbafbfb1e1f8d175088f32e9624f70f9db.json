His life takes a bizarre turn when a prostitute neighbor complains about the loss of her pimp. His partner, upon hearing the situation, suggests that they fill that opening themselves using the morgue at night as their brothel. Against his better judgement, he gets talked into the idea, only to find that it's more than his boss that has objections to this bit of entrepreneurship. \n\n\nTAGLINE:    Ever since two enterprising young men turned the City Morgue into a swinging business, people have been dying to get in.    It makes the day seem dead.    Together they are going to make the day pay off... all night long!    The oldest profession in a new-look comedy.\n \n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!!   \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
