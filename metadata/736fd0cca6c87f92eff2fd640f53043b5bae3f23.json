As irrational as he was surrealist, this genius diverted objects from their original meanings, plunging them into the acid of his constantly churning imagination. A megalomaniac and an artist who above all understood the force of marketing and publicity, DalÃƒÂ­ disorients the viewer in order to draw him into the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world. On his canvases, images and colours crash together to express and mock certain ideas, creating a subversive eroticism that taps into the subconscious of the avid voyeurs that we are.\n\nThe author, Eric Shanes, explores the twists and turns of DalÃƒÂ­Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s mad genius, commenting on the masterpieces of the painter so as to show the diversity and scope of his talent, leaving the reader blown away and bewitched by this Prince of Metamorphosis. This work opens up the sweet, mad universe of this megalomaniac genius and invites us to let ourselves be overcome Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ DalÃƒÂ­ is, first and foremost, an absolute.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:736fd0cca6c87f92eff2fd640f53043b5bae3f23","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Masterworks+of+Salvador+Dali+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"736fd0cca6c87f92eff2fd640f53043b5bae3f23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,111,208,204,166,200,127,146,239,242,253,100,15,83,4,59,91,174,63,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
