Joe Weeks is new to the Grange Estate. Tolerant, doesn't mind a bit of weed, doesn't try to pull other men's women. Live and let live is his motto... Eddie Quinn is the hardest man on the estate. Everyone knows that it's a bad idea to cross him, or his pit bull. But everyone also knows he's honest, as drug dealers go. Joe's pleased when Eddie offers him a job. But then he meets Katya. A prostitute. A slave. And desperate to escape from Eddie.\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22572d11f5902bc008e76c1e85435fea1a2c106f","amp;dn":"Mandasue+Heller%2C+The+Driver+%28best+seller%29+epub+mobi+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22572d11f5902bc008e76c1e85435fea1a2c106f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,87,45,17,245,144,43,192,8,231,108,30,133,67,95,234,26,44,16,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
