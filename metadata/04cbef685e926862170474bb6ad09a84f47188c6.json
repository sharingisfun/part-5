The series blends magic and primitive technology and the books are set in the Four Lands which in some books is identified as Earth long after civilization as we know it was destroyed in a chemical and nuclear holocaust called the Great Wars. By the time of the prequel First King of Shannara, the world has now reverted to a medieval state and magic has re-emerged to supplement science as humans and other races live in a place known as the Four Lands, which is a future North America. Further into the novels science starts to become more advanced.\nThe Original Shannara Trilogy\n1 The Sword of Shannara 1977\n2 The Elfstones of Shannara 1982\n3 The Wishsong of Shannara 1985\n\nThe Heritage of Shannara tetralogy\n1 The Scions of Shannara 1990\n2 The Druid of Shannara 1991\n3 The Elf Queen of Shannara 1992\n4 The Talismans of Shannara 1993\n\nPrequel to the Original Shannara Trilogy\n1 First King of Shannara 1996\n\nWord &amp; Void \n1 Running with the Demon 1997\n2 A Knight of the Word 1998\n3 Angel Fire East 1999\n\nThe Voyage of the Jerle Shannara trilogy\n1 Ilse Witch 2000\n2 Antrax 2001\n3 Morgawr 2002\n\nHigh Druid of Shannara trilogy\n1 Jarka Ruus 2003\n2 Tanequil 2004\n3 Straken 2005\n\nMagic Kingdom of Landover series\n1 Magic Kingdom For Sale  SOLD 1986\n2 The Black Unicorn 1987\n3 Wizard at Large 1988\n4 The Tangle Box 1994\n5 Witches' Brew  1995\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04cbef685e926862170474bb6ad09a84f47188c6","amp;dn":"Terry+Brooks+35th+Anniversary+Shannara+collection+22+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04cbef685e926862170474bb6ad09a84f47188c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,203,239,104,94,146,104,98,23,4,116,187,106,208,154,132,244,113,136,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
