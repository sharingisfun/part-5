So much of that \n\nmusic was about messing about and showing off, meaning a \n\nmusical sense of humour was usually as fundamental as a \n\nbassline; but here, the music is seldom relaxed enough to \n\ndrop its guard and too many tracks come across as \n\nremarkable reproductions of a sound.\n\nGibbonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ musical abilities have never been in doubt, but \n\nhis work here comes across as a little flat, as if \n\nconcentrating so much on what he was doing made him miss \n\nthe point of why he was doing it. This leaves what are \n\nsmart compositions, like Holding My Breath, The Importance \n\nof Elsewhere and A Time ForÃ¢â‚¬Â¦, having to be defined by their \n\nvocals. And, in said cases, these arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t very good.\n\nNot that this is a bad album, at all Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when it fires on all \n\ncylinders at the same time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very near to great. Fool, \n\nOne for Belski and Contusions occupy that interesting \n\njuncture, from the late-60s, where it was a very short step \n\nfrom soul to lounge, and a degree of cheesy playfulness was \n\nalways going to figure. Respectively, the smoky and \n\nseductive Angelique Morrison croons above chirping strings; \n\nnext, a hard driving rhythm takes the pressure off the \n\nHammond and flute allowing them to have some fun; and \n\nContusionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ big drums and honking brass has that almost \n\npointless self-celebration that underpinned some of the \n\nbest funk. P.A.R.T.Y. is bonkers hip hop, defined by \n\nrappers Wax &amp; Herbal TÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exuberant vocals, but in such a \n\ngood way the whole thing swings gloriously.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never easy approaching a style from the outside, as \n\nwhat contributed to making it special wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily be \n\nobvious Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ie the vibe of the time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but Gibbons gets closer \n\nthan most. Maybe next time out he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry about getting \n\nit so technically correct.\n\n-  Lloyd Bradley, BBC (2011-10-05) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed0d6b36606f3f5da1ace4a1d5788a7460864c1","amp;dn":"Lack+of+Afro+-+This+Time+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed0d6b36606f3f5da1ace4a1d5788a7460864c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,208,214,179,102,6,243,245,218,26,206,74,29,87,136,167,70,8,100,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
