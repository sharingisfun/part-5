Memphis Blood is a fresh injection of blues truth... Ulmer delivers here, big time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n*Ex-Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid rates a shout-out for convincing avant-jazz/funk guitarist James &quot;Blood&quot; Ulmer to take on this project.\nReid's belief that Ulmer possesses a great blues voice is vividly confirmed by the songs on display here. Backed by a fine lineup of players, Ulmer gets down on some meaty blues tunes, including Willie Dixon's &quot;Back Door Man&quot; and &quot;Spoonful,&quot; Otis Rush's &quot;Double Trouble,&quot; and the John Lee Hooker classic &quot;Money.&quot; Ulmer is consistently deep in the groove on vocals and guitar, but there are transcendent moments, specifically his enthralling version of the Son House song &quot;Death Letter,&quot; and his haunting cover of Rush's &quot;Double Trouble.&quot; \n\nUlmer's blues are as real and distinctive as his jazz.\n\n\nJAMES BLOOD ULMER\n\nMemphis Blood\nThe Sun Sessions\n\n\n- CD\n- 2001\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nGuitar, Vocals, James Blood Ulmer\nwith\nBass, Mark Peterson \nDrums, Aubrey Dayle \nGuitar, Vernon Reid \nHarp, David Barnes\nPiano, Organ, Accordion, Rick Steff \nViolin, Mandolin, Charles Burnham \n\n\nRecorded on 10, 11, 12 April 2001 at Sun Studios, Memphis, TN\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:238f8acfe3848d056ffe0cbd44c4bb065ce82279","amp;dn":"James+%27Blood%27+Ulmer+-+Memphis+Blood+The+Sun+Sessions+2001+-+320K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"238f8acfe3848d056ffe0cbd44c4bb065ce82279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,143,138,207,227,132,141,5,111,254,12,189,68,196,187,6,92,232,34,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
