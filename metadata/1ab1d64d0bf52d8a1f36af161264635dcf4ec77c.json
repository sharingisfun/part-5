What Separates Me From You is whiney, petulant, immature, hopeless, and thoroughly addicting, as the ten songs contained within the gatefold packaging (with the not-so-subtle painting of a man on a busy city street, trapped in an hourglass as the sand piles up around him) are as immaculately crafted and engaging as they are blindingly self-absorbed. Produced by New Found GloryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chad Gilbert, WSMFY blurs the line between clean vocal emo-punk and throat-exploding metalcore with great success, especially on the more brutal offerings like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sticks and StoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“2nd SucksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Be Tails,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I'll Be Sonic,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the guitarmony-laden album high point Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Is the House that Doubt Built.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ While mopey, melodic punk-pop jams like Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Signs Point to LauderdaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Out of TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ may sound like second-rate Against Me! cuts, the performances are so flawless and the knob-twiddling (mouse clicking) is so dialed in, that the volume nearly goes up on its own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab1d64d0bf52d8a1f36af161264635dcf4ec77c","amp;dn":"A+Day+to+Remember+-+What+Separates+Me+from+You+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab1d64d0bf52d8a1f36af161264635dcf4ec77c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,177,214,77,11,245,45,138,31,54,175,22,18,100,99,93,207,78,199,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
