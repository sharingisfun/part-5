But beginning with iOS is a great start. This course helps you build a simple note-taking app in iOS 8, one you can then re-create for Android and Windows Phone in Building a Note-Taking App for Android and Building a Note-Taking App for Windows Phone 8 and Windows Store.\n\nEach of these courses helps you build a complete mobile app from scratch; this installment uses the iOS SDK and Xcode to get the job done. Author Todd Perkins shows you how to create an Xcode project, lay out apps visually, connect UI elements to code, and save data to persistent storage. Start here with iOS 8, and compare your results with the Android and Windows Phone courses to learn about the differences and similarities of these mobile platforms.\nTopics include:\n\n    Previewing the note-taking app's features\n    Creating the Xcode project\n    Using local data storage\n    Creating a data class\n    Saving data to a file or user defaults\n    Understanding screens and storyboards\n    Controlling transitions between views\n    Connecting the controller to the data\n    Creating, editing, and deleting notes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:361fb6263c419fce28bef69186f7deb8ffebb3c9","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Building+a+Note-Taking+App+for+iOS+8+with+Todd+Perkin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"361fb6263c419fce28bef69186f7deb8ffebb3c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,31,182,38,60,65,159,206,40,190,246,145,134,247,222,184,255,235,179,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
