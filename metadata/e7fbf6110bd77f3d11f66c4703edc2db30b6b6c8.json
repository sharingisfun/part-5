It's the spot Brian Basco and Gina Timmins have chosen to take a well-earned vacation. An impromptu day trip to a remote and relatively uninhabited island goes awry, however; the plane stops working, and fast action is required if anyone is going to get out of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“idyllic tripÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ alive. Brian forces Gina from the plane, giving her the only working parachute. Brian luckily survives the plane's crash landing, but Gina has disappeared, setting the stage for a highly entertaining story.\n\nIn Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle, you will travel the world, from Alaska to Hawaii, from the highest reaches of the sky above to the harrowing deeps of the sea below, spooling out the thread of a gripping story. Immerse yourself in this tongue-in-cheek story where you'll meet a crazy cast of miscreants in order to solve a mystery too weirdly entertaining for words.\n\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: TEEN with Crude Humor, Language, Mild Violence, Sexual Themes, Use of Drugs.
