This upload examines the system of Priestcraft in Christianity and shows that it was unknown to early Christians and is against the teachings of Jesus. It is an innovation in Christianity that was borrowed from pagan practices. \n\nThe current exposure of the sex abuse scandals of the Church and its priests is only a small demonstration of the corruptions of Priestcraft. It shows how dangerous to the society could a group of people become when they put themselves in a class above people, and like gods give themselves the authority to exploit people and control their lives.\n\nThis UL contains 16 titles:\n\n1- Howitt - A Popular History of Priestcraft in All Ages and Nations (1833).\n\n2- Bush - Priesthood and Clergy Unknown to Christianity (1857).\n\n3- Evans - The Price of Priestcraft (1904).\n\n4- Stutfield ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Priestcraft: A Study in Unnecessary Fiction (1921).\n\n5- Wheless - Forgery in Christianity: A Documented Record of the Foundations of Christian Religion (1930).
