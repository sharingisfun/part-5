From 1943 the Red ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preference for close-quarters combat resulted in entire infantry units being equipped with nothing but SMGs. By deploying multiple SMG-armed companies and battalions, the Red Army was able to develop ferocious firepower in urban warfare and position assaults, the soldiers keeping within the SMGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s effective range of about 150m to nullify the German skills in armoured and manoeuvre warfare, artillery support and aerial bombardment. Featuring expert analysis and an array of specially commissioned full-colour artwork, this engaging study explains the history, use and development of Soviet wartime SMGs in detail. It gives particular focus to the tactical applications of these weapons in combat, and how they compared to firearms wielded by their German opponents. With numerous first-hand combat accounts, and detailed technical explanations, this book is ideal for both the general reader and the firearms enthusiast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28fbb118567e5ad652f6d0bda479d13b6a56681d","amp;dn":"Soviet+Submachine+Guns+of+World+War+II%3A+PPD-40%2C+PPSh-41+and+PPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28fbb118567e5ad652f6d0bda479d13b6a56681d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,251,177,24,86,126,90,214,82,246,208,189,164,121,209,59,106,86,104,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
