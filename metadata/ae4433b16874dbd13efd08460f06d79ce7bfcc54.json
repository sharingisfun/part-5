Jack's friend is Algernon Moncrieft (Michael Denison), a poor bloke living on credit. Jack refers mysteriously to Algernon about his country retreat, which drives Algernon to distraction, trying to figure out where Jack goes on the weekends. Jack is also in love with Algernon's attractive cousin Gwendolen (Joan Greenwood). He also has a ward, Cecily Cardew (Dorothy Tutin), who lives at the country estate and studies with local spinster Miss Prism (Margaret Rutherford). When Algernon learns of Cecily, he arrives at the country home claiming to be Jack's brother Earnest, knowing Jack had previously regaled Cecily with tales of having to bail the fictitious Earnest out of scrapes so he could sneak out to the city. Having set her eyes on &quot;Earnest&quot; in the flesh after having heard countless tales of his intrigues, Cecily immediately falls in love with Earnest. Meanwhile, Jack comes back to the country dressed in black, determined to announce to the group the demise of the fictional Earnest. As a result, Jack is stupefied when he sees Earnest standing in front of him. Meanwhile, Algernon's aunt, Lady Bracknell (Edith Evans) refuses to grant permission for Jack and Gwendolen's engagement. However, when Lady Bracknell finds out that Algernon is in love with Cecily, she asks Jack for his blessing on their marriage. Of course, Jack won't give his blessing until Lady Bracknell gives her blessing to his proposed marriage to Gwendolen. All is at a standstill until Lady Bracknell recognizes Miss Prism as a governess from the past who holds secrets concerning both Jack and Algernon.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044744/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044744/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-12787&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-12787&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector: Anthony Asquith\n\n\n\n\n\tMichael Redgrave\t ... \tJack Worthing\n\tRichard Wattis\t... \tSeton\n\tMichael Denison\t... \tAlgernon Moncrieff\n\tWalter Hudd\t... \tLane\n\tEdith Evans\t... \tLady Augusta Bracknell\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:31:30\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1213 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae4433b16874dbd13efd08460f06d79ce7bfcc54","amp;dn":"The+Importance+of+Being+Earnest+%281952%29+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae4433b16874dbd13efd08460f06d79ce7bfcc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,68,51,177,104,116,219,209,62,253,8,70,15,6,215,156,231,191,204,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
