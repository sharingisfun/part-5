Originally the solo project of singer/songwriter Dan Smith, Bastille expanded to a quartet after he decided to form a band and got some of his friends involved. The band attracted a lot of attention after putting a few tracks online, leading to support slots at major U.K. festivals like Glastonbury and the Isle of Wight. While their lush, heavily '80s-inspired melodies, anthemic choruses, and literate, emotionally raw lyrics, delivered in SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swooping voice, undoubtedly appealed to kids weaned on the sounds of La Roux and Florence + the Machine, at least part of the hype was due to the flagrantly copyright-breaching videos that Smith, an ardent film buff, edited together out of footage from old movies like Terrence MalickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Badlands. Eventually they secured a deal with hip indie label Young and Lost Club and released their debut 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ single, Flaws/Icarus, in July 2011. This was followed later that year by Laura Palmer EP, named for the teenaged murder victim in David LynchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cult '90s TV series Twin Peaks; the creepy accompanying video for the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“OverjoyedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was also heavily inspired by the series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea5d762ed0b7c3152e80f6a6e1b58678abe2f51","amp;dn":"Bastille+-+Bad+Blood+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea5d762ed0b7c3152e80f6a6e1b58678abe2f51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,165,215,98,237,11,124,49,82,232,15,106,110,27,88,103,138,190,47,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
