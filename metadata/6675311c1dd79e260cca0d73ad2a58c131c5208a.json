The film is centered around Katniss Everdeen - a 16-year-old girl\nfrom District 12, who volunteers for her 12-year-old sister, Prim, when\nPrim's name is chosen - and Katniss's fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta\nMellark, with whom she has some rather dramatic history. Katniss is then\nrushed to the Capitol, where she undergoes intense training before being\nthrust into the arena to fight to become the victor of the seventy-fourth\nannual Hunger Games.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Jennifer Lawrence.\n=&gt;-Josh Hutcherson.\n=&gt;-Liam Hemsworth.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Gary Ross.\n\nThe Hunger Games Catching Fire.\nKatniss and Peeta's unprecedented co-victory in the 74th Hunger Games\nstirs an uprising. President Snow visits Katniss to threaten the lives of\neveryone she knows and holds dear if she doesn't do all she can to toe the\nline and quell the unrest. As her best efforts fail, Plutarch Heavensbee\n(a former games-master, now returned) meets with Snow to implement a\nQuarter Quell, by which to gather all former Hunger Game victors and have\nthem eliminate each other. Katniss and Peeta end up in the Quarter Quell\nbut must form alliances in order to survive; however, those with whom\nKatniss prefers to ally herself seem to be for emotional rather than\ntactical reasons.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Jennifer Lawrence.\n=&gt;-Josh Hutcherson.\n=&gt;-Liam Hemsworth.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Francis Lawrence.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre..........................: Action : Adventure : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...................: 2012 : 2013.\n=&gt;-Language.......................: English : Spanish.\n=&gt;-File Size......................: 2.04 GiB : 2.09 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...............: 2 047 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..................: 2h 22mn : 2h 26mn.\n=&gt;-The Hunger Games...............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/\n=&gt;-The Hunger Games...............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hunger_games/\n=&gt;-The Hunger Games...............: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hunger-games/\n=&gt;-The Hunger Games Catching Fire.: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951264/\n=&gt;-The Hunger Games Catching Fire.: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hunger_games_catching_fire/\n=&gt;-The Hunger Games Catching Fire.: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hunger-games-catching-fire/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...................: 2.40:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.....................: 1920 x 800.\n=&gt;-Bit rate.......................: 1800 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels.......................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.......................: 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...............: 257 Kbps.\n\nAudio Spanish.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels.......................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.......................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...............: 217 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English.\n=&gt;-Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6675311c1dd79e260cca0d73ad2a58c131c5208a","amp;dn":"The+Hunger+Games+1%2C+2+-+Jennifer+Lawrence+Duology+Eng+Spa+Multi-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6675311c1dd79e260cca0d73ad2a58c131c5208a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,117,49,28,29,215,158,38,12,202,13,115,173,42,88,193,49,197,32,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
