(pronounced ai-kei-ju, abbreviated as iku) is a 2001 independent film directed by Taiwanese-American experimental filmmaker Shu Lea Cheang. It was marketed as &quot;a Japanese Sci-Fi Porn Feature&quot;. The film was partially inspired by Blade Runner (1982). I.K.U.'s premise involves a futuristic corporation sending shapeshifting cyborgs out into New Tokyo to collect &quot;orgasm data&quot; by means of sexual intercourse. The title is a pun on the Japanese word iku (Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã£ï¿½ï¿½) which, in sexual slang, is used to express an orgasm.\n\nI.K.U. premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival. It was the first pornographic film ever screened in the festival.\n\nCAST\nAyumi Tokito as Reiko number one\nMaria Yumeno as Reiko number two\nYumeka Sasaki as Reiko number three\nMiho Ariga as Reiko number four\nMyu Asou as Reiko number five\nEtuyo Tsuchida as Reiko number six\nTsousie as Reiko number seven\nZachery Nataf as Dizzy\nMash as Mash\nAja as Tokyo Rose\nAkira the Hustler as Akira","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a96af772553147598aa9163075fdac4948223b4","amp;dn":"IKU-2.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a96af772553147598aa9163075fdac4948223b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,150,175,119,37,83,20,117,152,170,145,99,7,95,218,196,148,130,35,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
