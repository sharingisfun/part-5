Secrecy is the key to FaerieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survivalÃ¢â‚¬â€but no secret can be kept forever, and when the fae and mortal worlds collide, changelings are born. Half-human, half-fae, outsiders from birth, these second-class children of Faerie spend their lives fighting for the respect of their immortal relations. Or, in the case of October Ã¢â‚¬Å“TobyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Daye, rejecting it completely.\n\nAfter getting burned by both sides of her heritage, Toby has denied the fae world, retreating into a Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ life. Unfortunately for her, Faerie has other ideas. The murder of Countess Evening Winterrose, one of the secret regents of the San Francisco Bay Area, pulls Toby back into the fae world. Unable to resist EveningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dying curse, which binds her to investigate, Toby is forced to resume her old position as knight errant to the Duke of Shadowed Hills and begin renewing old alliances that may prove her only hope of solving the mystery...before the curse catches up with her","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef314f512a9e8e2e65a9bf7f67bf432c615db4a1","amp;dn":"+Rosemary+and+Rue+-+Seanan+McGuire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef314f512a9e8e2e65a9bf7f67bf432c615db4a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,49,79,81,42,158,142,46,101,169,191,127,103,191,67,44,97,93,180,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
