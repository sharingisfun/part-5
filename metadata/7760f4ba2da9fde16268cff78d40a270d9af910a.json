It is flyable and some of the gauges and buttons do work. Also the Auto pilot works to. \nIv added 3 liverys to the package as it came with none!!!\n\n*****NOTE*****\nThis aircraft is not cracked, but i believe the activation lies in the qwings.dll (Located in the qualitywings folder in the fsx directory). I am working on it but its time consuming!!\n\nIv included the .exe if anyone wants to have a try a busting this bird!!!\n\n\nF.B.I :-)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7760f4ba2da9fde16268cff78d40a270d9af910a","amp;dn":"FSX%2FFS9+QUALITYWINGS146+%28READ+DESCRIPTION+FIRST%29+RE-UPLOAD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7760f4ba2da9fde16268cff78d40a270d9af910a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,96,244,186,45,169,253,225,98,104,207,247,141,64,162,112,217,175,145,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
