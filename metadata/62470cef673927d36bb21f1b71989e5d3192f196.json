Each song offers a distinct listening experience and carries its own story. Songs from previous Bethel Music albums have been deconstructed and re-arranged into versions that hint at original melodies through unique instrumentation and modern sounds. Each track creates a dynamic, ambient, and cinematic atmosphere free from lyric and discourse. This album ventures into new territory and explores what it is to worship without words.\n\nTrack Listings\n1. What Does It Sound Like\n2. God I Look To You\n3. Forgiven\n4.
