This text focuses on problem-solving applications rather than theory, using MATLAB throughout. Theory is introduced to inform key concepts which are framed in applications and demonstrated using MATLAB. The new second edition feature new chapters on Numerical Differentiation, Optimization, and Boundary-Value Problems (ODEs).\n\nAbout the Author\nSteven C.
