Dick Powell stars as John Forbes, a successful insurance man with a trophy wife named Sue (Jane Wyatt) and a model child named Tommy (Jimmy Hunt). Despite all that he's achieved in life, Forbes feels somehow unfulfilled. Thus it is that when his glamorous client Mona Stevens (Lizabeth Scott) &quot;comes on&quot; to him, Forbes falls for her like a ton of bricks. After a brief affair, Forbes suffers the pangs of guilt, a fact immediately capitalized upon by Mona's ex-lover, seedy private eye Macdonald (Raymond Burr). If adultery has always been committed, can murder be far behind? Many individual scenes in Pitfall are standouts, notably a brief moment wherein Forbes' son Tommy suffers a horrible nightmare-in almost exactly the same manner that child actor Jimmy Hunt would endure a similar bad dream in 1953's Invaders from Mars! Like many of the best noir efforts of the 1940s, Pitfall (based on a novel by Jay Dratler) is told in flashback, as John Forbes spills his guts to his disillusioned spouse. -- Hal Erickson\n\nDick Powell\t ...\tJohn Forbes\nLizabeth Scott\t ...\tMona Stevens\nJane Wyatt \t ...\tSue Forbes\nRaymond Burr\t ...\tJ.B.
