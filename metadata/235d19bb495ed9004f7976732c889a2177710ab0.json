WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it be great if you could use HTML as your own domain specific language (DSL) and have it be a custom thing tuned exactly to the elements and attributes you need for the project youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re building?\nAngularJS provides this exact solution by separating these two features so that you can make changes in the visual layout without affecting your code.
