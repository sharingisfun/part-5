We spent years of\r\n  researching the technique of famous painters in order to be able to\r\n  closely mimic their style of painting, something which has never been\r\n  successfully done in an automatic computer painting program before.\r\n\r\n  Looks like a real painting\r\n  One thing that puts DAP above others is that the output images will\r\n  look like a painting even in small size (for example resized on web\r\n  or looking from a distance when printed). This is normally a common\r\n  deal-breaker with all automatic filters which when resized down will\r\n  look simply like a processed photo.\r\n\r\n  Looks like a painting up-close\r\n  Looking at details you may think we are showing you a real canvas.\r\n  An in some sense it is actually true. There is an option in the\r\n  software called Real Canvas that simulates the way a real canvas or\r\n  artistic paper interact with the paint. There is enough details even\r\n  for a largest print.\r\n\r\n Never paints the same image twice\r\n Not only do you have a large variety of painter styles, you can choose\r\n different impressions and palettes. However even with the same settings\r\n the brush strokes will differ from one image to another as would do with\r\n a real painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The new version is a fully mature professional software that adds many\r\n tools and presets for ultra realistic complex details and brushworks.\r\n With the right subject, it is capable of producing large, highly\r\n detailed paintings that look real and organic while still keeping a\r\n distinguishable style of a real painter.\r\n\r\n With the new Outline, Layers, Material and Real Lights the canvas\r\n become truly alive with scratches, dried paint and bumps. Great for\r\n application where close-up detail is important such as very large prints.\r\n\r\n\r\n Version 4.2 has added a Tablet Touch mode for 2-in-1 and\r\n Slate Windows 10 notebooks. The screen will automatically switch\r\n into simplified touch mode when the slate is undocked from the keyboard\r\n\r\n For\r\n Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10 (x86 x64)\r\n\r\n\r\n                [INSTALLATION]\r\n                                     \r\n\r\n\r\n          - Unrar with you favorite archiver, such as WinRar.\r\n\r\n          - Run Setup and Install.\r\n\r\n          - Run Keygen-bean with ADMIN Rights and Generate Serial.\r\n\r\n          - Or just use a very boring serial.\r\n\r\n\r\n                â€¢ Thats it!
