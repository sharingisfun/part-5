He was also awarded the Booker Prize for literature in 1980 for his novel Rites of Passage, the first book in what became his sea trilogy, To the Ends of the Earth.\n\nGolding was knighted by Elizabeth II in 1988. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 2008, The Times ranked Golding third on their list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.\n\nHis first novel, Lord of the Flies (1954; film, 1963 and 1990; play, adapted by Nigel Williams, 1995), describes a group of boys stranded on a tropical island reverting back to savagery. The Inheritors (1955) shows &quot;new people&quot; (generally identified with Homo sapiens sapiens), triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with Neanderthals) by deceit and violence. His 1956 novel Pincher Martin records the delusions experienced by a drowning sailor in his last moments. Free Fall (1959) explores the issue of free choice as a prisoner held in solitary confinement in a German POW camp during World War Two looks back over his life. The Spire (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be Salisbury Cathedral); the spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity. In his 1967 novel The Pyramid three separate stories in a shared setting (a small English town in the 1920s) are linked by a narrator, and The Scorpion God (1971) consists of three novellas, the first set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band ('Clonk, Clonk'), the second in an ancient Egyptian court ('The Scorpion God') and the third in the court of a Roman emperor ('Envoy Extraordinary'). The last of these reworks his 1958 play The Brass Butterfly. His later novels include Darkness Visible (1979), which is about a terrorist group, a paedophile teacher, and a mysterious angel like figure who survived a fire in the blitz, The Paper Men (1984) which is about the conflict between a writer and his biographer, and a sea trilogy To the Ends of the Earth, which includes the Rites of Passage (1980), Close Quarters (1987), and Fire Down Below (1989), the first book of which (originally intended as a stand alone novel) won the Booker Prize.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1983 was awarded to William Golding &quot;for his novels which, with the perspicuity of realistic narrative art and the diversity and universality of myth, illuminate the human condition in the world of today&quot;.\n\nThe torrent contains all the following books in both ePUB and Mobi formats unless otherwise stated:\n\nNovels\n\n*  Lord of the Flies (1954) -- ePUB\n\n*  The Inheritors (1955)\n\n*  Pincher Martin (1956)\n\n*  The Spire (1964)\n\n*  The Pyramid (1967)\n\n*  The Scorpion God (1971)\n\n*  The Paper Men (1984)\n\n*  Rites of Passage (1980) -- ePUB\n\n*  The Double Tongue  (1995)\n\nRead the following articles, listen to the interview, check out the websites, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Golding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Golding&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.william-golding.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.william-golding.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1983/golding-bio.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1983/golding-bio.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.william-golding.co.uk/news/audio-interview-marx.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.william-golding.co.uk/news/audio-interview-marx.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9142869/William-Golding-A-frighteningly-honest-writer.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9142869/William-Golding-A-frighteningly-honest-writer.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3db22a73fe114460500ac426f38a68155be38d69","amp;dn":"William+Golding+-+Nobel+Prize+in+Literature+1983+%289+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3db22a73fe114460500ac426f38a68155be38d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,178,42,115,254,17,68,96,80,10,196,38,243,138,104,21,91,227,141,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
