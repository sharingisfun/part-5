That's what the 15 tracks collected here represent: singles and songs that were promoted for radio airplay, not necessarily the &quot;best of&quot; Faith No More. The compilation wisely selects only two key tracks from the Chuck Mosley era, and while it's missing the band's collaboration with the Boo-Y.A.A. Tribe for the Judgment Night soundtrack, it does include the non-LP covers of the Commodores' &quot;Easy&quot; and the Bee Gees' &quot;I Started a Joke.&quot; However, because the emphasis is on commercially promoted material, there are only five total entries from the group's two defining albums (The Real Thing and Angel Dust); there are three apiece from the somewhat less interesting King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime and Album of the Year. The adrenaline rush of a good Faith No More album lies in the way the band walks the fine line between eclecticism and disjointedness; concentrating only on their most commercially accessible selections simply can't capture that feeling. Granted, Who Cares a Lot is not without its uses; it will satisfy fans who just want the band's recognizable songs on one disc, or who don't have the patience to sort through the more uneven albums. But if its aim is to be a definitive Faith No More retrospective, Who Cares a Lot falls well short of the mark.
