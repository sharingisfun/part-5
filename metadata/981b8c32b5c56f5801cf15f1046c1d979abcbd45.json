It is built on the Chrome's JavaScript Runtime and can be used to build large scale web applications to quick time. It uses non blocken I/O and even driven model to allow creation of lightweight and highly scalable web applications. Our training program emphasizes on practical application of this amazing technology and will teach you nodejs development using real world application development.\n\nYou will learn about JavaScript Server programming, Node and NPM modules, the use of other associated technologies and frameworks while building the ten projects. The technologies covered in the course includes HTML/CSS Frontend technologies, Nodejs NPM, NoSQL database, Column Databases, Database ORM, Express Framework, Asynchronous programming, Karken layer, Drywall user management, Bcrypt encryption, Socket IO and REST APIs\n\nProject 1: Simple Web Server\nProject 2: Basic Express Website\nProject 3: User Login System\nProject 4: Node Blog Systems\nProject 5: Community Events\nProject 6: BookStore\nProject 7: Chat IO\nProject 8: Doctor Directory\nProject 9: Portfolio App\nProject 10: Elearning System","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:981b8c32b5c56f5801cf15f1046c1d979abcbd45","amp;dn":"udemy+-+Learn+Nodejs+by+building+10+projects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"981b8c32b5c56f5801cf15f1046c1d979abcbd45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,27,140,50,181,197,111,88,1,207,21,241,4,108,29,151,154,188,189,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
