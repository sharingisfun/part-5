The group was founded by bassist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee, who were later joined by guitarist Mick Mars, and vocalist Vince Neil. MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e has been described through the years as one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 100 million records, including 45 million in the U.S.\n\nThe members of the band have often been noted for their hedonistic lifestyles and the persona they maintained. Various original members have had numerous brushes with the law, spent time in prison, suffered from alcoholism, suffered from long addictions to drugs such as cocaine and heroin, had countless escapades with women and are heavily tattooed. The band is considered as a part of the first wave of glam metal. Their ninth and most recent studio album, Saints of Los Angeles, was released on June 24, 2008, and was certified Gold in January 2012. The band is currently embarking on a final tour that will continue through 2015 before retiring.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRed, White &amp; CrÃƒÂ¼e is a anthology album by the heavy metal band MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e, released on February 1, 2005 by MÃƒÂ¶tley Records and charted at number 6 on The Billboard 200. To coincide with the album's release, the band reunited with drummer Tommy Lee, who left the band in 1999. Bassist Nikki Sixx commented on the band's reunion, comparing it to &quot;seeing Mike Tyson fight. He probably wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bite anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ear off Ã¢â‚¬â€ but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re there in case he does.&quot;\n\nAccording to vocalist Vince Neil, the early stages of the band's reunion were &quot;kinda' strained. I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talked to Tommy Lee in years. Everyone was really guarded and had their managers there. It was very strange. Mick Mars was home, I guess. Either there or the hospital.&quot;\n\nRed, White &amp; CrÃƒÂ¼e features three new studio recordings: the album's lead single, &quot;If I Die Tomorrow&quot;, co-written by pop punk band Simple Plan, the second single &quot;Sick Love Song&quot; and &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, a Rolling Stones cover. Tommy Lee does not perform on the cover of &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;; drumming duties were handled by Josh Freese of The Vandals.\n\nRed, White &amp; CrÃƒÂ¼e is certified platinum.\n\nA video was made for &quot;Sick Love Song,&quot; though the video, mostly composed of produced concert clips, got only scarce airplay, the song found its way onto some rock-orientated radio stations.\n\nA special edition that includes a &quot;Greatest Video Hits&quot; DVD compilation was also made.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMembers:\n\nMick Mars: guitar, backing vocals (1981Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nNikki Sixx: bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1981Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nTommy Lee: drums, percussion, piano, backing vocals (1981Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1999, 2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nVince Neil: lead vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica (1981Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1992, 1997Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\n\nFormer:\n\nJohn Corabi: lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano (1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1996)\n\nRandy Castillo: drums, percussion (1999Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2002)\n\nSamantha Maloney: drums, percussion (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004)\n\n\nTouring:\n\nSamantha Maloney: drums, percussion (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2002)\n\nWill Hunt: drums, percussion (June 12, 2007)\n\nMorgan Rose: drums, percussion (August 2009)\n\nFrank Zummo: drums, percussion (August 2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d34b4977cd782c34731ea4ec0fa93d92c56871b8","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-+Red%2C+White+%26amp%3B+Crew+%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B2005%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d34b4977cd782c34731ea4ec0fa93d92c56871b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,75,73,119,205,120,44,52,115,30,164,236,15,169,61,146,197,104,113,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
