His career stretches all the way back to early rave and\nacid-house releases in the late 80s and early 90s as U.H.F. and Voodoo Child, through to his much\nloved/hated R&amp;B/blues/pop/techno sample cut-ups of today.\n\nHis most notable tracks from his early days include &quot;Next Is The E&quot;, &quot;Everytime You Touch Me&quot; and\n&quot;Into The Blue&quot;, and the classic &quot;Go&quot;, as well as his early albums &quot;Ambient&quot; and &quot;Early Underground&quot;.\nA brief outing into more rock-oriented territory came with 1996's &quot;Animal Rights&quot;, followed by\n&quot;I Like To Score&quot; in 1997, highlighting his past movie score contributions\n(most notably a remix of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;).\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Moby found unprecedented pop success with the album &quot;Play&quot; and the slew of singles\nand radio tracks that came from it (&quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Run On&quot;, &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot;, &quot;Natural Blues&quot;,\n&quot;Porcelain&quot;, &quot;Southside&quot;, and more). Among other things, his appearance as a DJ in the foyer of the 2000\nMTV Video Music Awards (wearing a gold suit and playing two golden copies of &quot;Play&quot;) led many people to\ndecry him as a sellout. Nonetheless, his follow-up album &quot;18&quot; tinkered very little with the &quot;Play&quot; sound\nand still received a mostly positive reception in 2002.\n\nBesides the many faces of his music, Moby also gathers controversy for his outspoken religious, dietary\nand animal rights views, as well as persistent rumors that his live shows are mostly pre-recorded.\nEvery Moby release from the mid-90s onward has borne the text\n&quot;Animals are not ours to eat, wear or experiment on. Thanks to Christ.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\nThe 90's\n\n01. Erasure - Chorus (Vegan Mix) [05:29]\n02. Brian Eno - Fractal Zoom (Mary's Birthday Mix) [07:06]\n03.
