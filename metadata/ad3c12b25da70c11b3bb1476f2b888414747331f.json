Like, literally â€“ MOMÃ¢Â€â„¢s all over the place. The positioning of that moon was terribly inconsiderate. Now her ship parts are scattered far and wide across an entire alien planet so rich in flora and fauna it would make even the most jaded galactic gardenerÃ¢Â€â„¢s head spin. ItÃ¢Â€â„¢s up to BUD to collect all her parts and get them back to the moon.\r\n\r\nGame Features\r\nJoin this adorable wobbly robot on his fantastical acroBUDic adventure to the moon.\r\nCollect MOMÃ¢Â€â„¢s ship parts with the help of your new friend POD. She likes planets. A lot.\r\nExplore an entire alien planet filled with excitement and wonder. And a Flungus.\r\nWalkingÃ¢Â€â„¢s overrated. Tuck BUD into Ball mode to boost, bounce and roll around the planet.\r\nTake to the air and soar between floating islands like a big metal bird with the Power Glider.\r\nExercise those green fingers and overcome obstacles by spawning any plant youÃ¢Â€â„¢ve found with the Floradex 3000.\r\nRide giant Starplants into the sky (yes, we know what they look likeâ€¦)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad3c12b25da70c11b3bb1476f2b888414747331f","amp;dn":"Grow+Up+%28MULTI6%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad3c12b25da70c11b3bb1476f2b888414747331f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,60,18,178,93,167,12,17,179,187,20,118,242,184,136,65,71,71,51,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
