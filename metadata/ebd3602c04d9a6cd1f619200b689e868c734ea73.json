Formed in 1952 after attending high school together, the Dells' repertoire has included doo-wop, jazz, soul, disco and contemporary rhythm and blues. Unlike many of their contemporaries, the group's lineup hasn't changed much since 1960 and has consisted of falsetto leader Johnny Carter, baritone lead singer Marvin Junior and background singers Mickey McGill, Verne Allison and Chuck Barksdale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd3602c04d9a6cd1f619200b689e868c734ea73","amp;dn":"The+Dells-Very+Best+Of+The+Dells-Oh+What+A+Night-2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd3602c04d9a6cd1f619200b689e868c734ea73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,211,96,44,4,217,166,205,31,97,146,0,182,137,232,104,199,52,234,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
