Extremely reader-friendly, the book begins with an overview of basic electricity concepts--rather than complex mathematical calculations. From here, you proceed directly to &quot;must-know&quot; information, including how to determine wire sizes and make a variety of common switch connections. Different types of electrical power panels are also examined in detail. Discussion of general wiring practices and circuit protectors, as well as an introduction to transformers and three-phase and single-phase motors, round out the comprehensive coverage.\n\nAbout the Author\nStephen L. Herman is a retired electrician and teacher with more than 30 years of experience to his credit. A seasoned author, his reader-friendly textbooks on electricity and mathematics are popular with students and instructors alike.
