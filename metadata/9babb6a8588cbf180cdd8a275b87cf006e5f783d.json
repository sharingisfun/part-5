Set in the oceans in the future, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dependency on oil has grown to an even larger amount. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you and a crew of men to travel the ocean, find abandoned oil drilling islands, and reclaim them for the United Oil of Oceana company.\n\nOnce you land on an island, you have a set amount of days and oil barrels to make during your stay. Fire up those old drilling machines and start making oil underwater, watch the oil barrel market and sell at the highest price, repair machines and do it all within the time youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re given, or the UOO will boot you off the island for a better crew. Sell more barrels to achieve higher ranks and perks, upgrade your machines, and conquer the ocean!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9babb6a8588cbf180cdd8a275b87cf006e5f783d","amp;dn":"The+Oil+Blue%3A+Steam+Legacy+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9babb6a8588cbf180cdd8a275b87cf006e5f783d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,171,182,168,88,140,191,24,12,221,138,39,91,135,207,0,110,95,120,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
