In 2005, Peter Broderick heard two songs that Justin had recorded in a friend's basement, and proceeded to track Justin down via the internet. Shortly after that, the two started playing music together. For the most part, Justin writes the songs initially, and then Peter helps to arrange them with varying instrumentation.\n\nMembers:\n-------------------\n\n* Justin Ringle: Vocals, Guitar, Banjo, Percussion\n* Nathan Crockett: Vocals, Saw, travelling suit salesman\n* Catherine Odell: Cello, Vocals\n* Sam Cooper: Banjo, Violin, Mandolin, Percussion, Vocals\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n--------------------------\n\n01 - Thistled Spring\n02 - Starving Robins\n03 - Belly of June\n04 - Cascades\n05 - This Bed\n06 - The Drought\n07 - Vernonia Blues\n08 - As A Ghost\n09 - The Widower\n10 - HeavenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s No Place\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nENJOY!\nAND REMEMBER: KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa90e8ae8f2d379fffda3204fa8c1228b9f3e486","amp;dn":"Horse+Feathers+-+Thistled+Spring+%282010%29%28Indie+Folk%29%28VBR-MP3%29%28Kil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa90e8ae8f2d379fffda3204fa8c1228b9f3e486","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,144,232,174,143,45,55,159,255,218,50,4,250,140,18,40,185,243,228,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
