The concert offered tracks from his Rat Pack covers album Swing When You're Winning  an album that finally gave him across the board appeal from nostalgic Grannies to hormonally imbalanced teenagers. With the average ticket price well into three figures and the likes of Tara Palmer-Tompkinson, Bob Geldof and Nicole Kidman in the stalls, this was no ordinary Robbie concert. Backed by a full swing band, accompanied by a slew of glamorous dancers, compered by Rupert Everett and featuring duets with John Lovitz, Jane Horrocks, the scene-stealing Jonathan Wilkes and even Old Blue Eyes himself Frank Sinatra (albeit in video form), Robbie takes centre stage and performs like never before. Classic track follows classic track--from &quot;The Lady is a Tramp&quot; (which Robbie dedicates to his last three girlfriends), to &quot;Mr Bojangles&quot; to &quot;My Way&quot;, each and every one of them is instantly recognisable, even to most of the younger members of the audience. Directed by Hamish Hamilton (the man behind the spectacular U2 Elevation DVD) this is a great up close and personal view of an intimate gig. \n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Intro\n02 - Have You Met Miss Jones?\n03 - Mack The Knife\n04 - Straighten Up and Flight Rigt\n05 - Let's face The Music and Dance\n06 - Well, Did You Evah\n07 - The Lady Is A Tramp\n08 - Things\n09 - One For My Baby\n10 - Mr Bojangles\n11 - I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen\n12 - Do NothinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Till You Hear From Me\n13 - Beyond The Sea\n14 - Me And My Shadow\n15 - AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t That A Kick In The Head\n16 - It Was A Very Good Year\n17 - My Way\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL DATA:\n\nFile Size: 4479 MB\nRuntime: 01h 11m 19s\nVideo Codec: X264\nAverage Quantizer: 19.006\nContainer: Matroska (.mkv)\nVideo Bitrate: 7267 Kbps\nResolution: 1280 x 724\nFPS (Frames/sec): 23.976\nQF (Frame quality): 0.262\n\nAudio Codec: DTS 1536 kbps 5.1 (English)\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/4328/robbie1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/4328/robbie1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/8638/robbie2f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/8638/robbie2f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/4033/robbie3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/4033/robbie3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/1033/robbie4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/1033/robbie4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/4518/robbie5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/4518/robbie5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8641/robbie6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8641/robbie6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/1324/robbie7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/1324/robbie7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/8541/robbie8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/8541/robbie8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/3598/robbie9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/3598/robbie9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5100/robbie10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5100/robbie10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1425/robbie11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1425/robbie11.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5e106ef663139d57a180ee1239688110904147d","amp;dn":"Robbie+Williams+-+Live+At+The+Royal+Albert+Hall+%28BDrip+720p+DTS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5e106ef663139d57a180ee1239688110904147d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,225,6,239,102,49,57,213,122,24,14,225,35,150,136,17,9,4,20,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
