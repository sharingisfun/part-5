The book calls for the end of &quot;mass&quot; and for the beginning of offering people more choices, more interests, and giving them more authority to operate in ways that reflect their own unique values.\n\nFor generations, marketers, industrialists, and politicians have tried to force us into little boxes, complying with their idea of what we should buy, use, or want. And in an industrial, mass-market driven world, this was efficient and it worked. But what we've learned in this new era is that mass limits our choice, because it succeeds through conformity. As Godin has identified, a new era of weirdness is upon us. People with more choices, more interests, and the power to do something about it are stepping forward and insisting that the world work in a different way. By enabling choice, we allow people to survive and thrive.\n\n--------------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theaudiobookvault.ws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theaudiobookvault.ws&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0405b765b482ba9066e3b53e6de1a2832f1135f9","amp;dn":"We+Are+All+Weird+-+Seth+Godin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0405b765b482ba9066e3b53e6de1a2832f1135f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,5,183,101,180,130,186,144,102,227,181,62,109,225,162,131,47,17,53,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
