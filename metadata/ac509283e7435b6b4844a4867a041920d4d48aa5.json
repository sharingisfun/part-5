It was founded in Chicago in 1953 by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from HefnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother. The magazine has grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc., with a presence in nearly every medium. Playboy is one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best known brands. In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of Playboy are published worldwide.\n\n[IMG]http://i1363.photobucket.com/albums/r712/wirelesstacos/PlayboyMagUSA092013_zps3d666a8a.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n                     English | 158 pages | PDF | 102.68 MB\n\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac509283e7435b6b4844a4867a041920d4d48aa5","amp;dn":"Playboy+Magazine+USA+September+2013+%5Bazizex666%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac509283e7435b6b4844a4867a041920d4d48aa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,80,146,131,231,67,91,107,72,68,164,134,122,4,25,32,212,212,138,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
