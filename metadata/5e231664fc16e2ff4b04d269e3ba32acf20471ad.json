Voth\nMonterey Peninsula College\nPh.D., Purdue University\n\n\n\nAs Professor Voth explains, &quot;As long as there have been people in the world, there have been stories.&quot; In this course, you'll sample some of the greatest literary expressions the world has known and experience storytelling in its many forms, including poetry, drama, and narrative.\n\nThe course begins in the ancient world, where tribal bards created national myths and founded religious texts out of legends, history, philosophy, and local lore. From there, you'll travel to the Far East to encounter the brief, suggestive, and deeply personal lyric poets of Classical Japan and China.\n\nYou'll also wander the countryside and aristocratic courts of India and the Middle East, collecting stories and folklore of magical men, terrifying beasts, alluring women, and conniving tricksters that live on in today's fairy tales and bedtime stories.\n\nSubsequent lectures follow the evolution of the art of the story as it appears in sophisticated narratives such as Wu Ch'eng-en's Monkey and Voltaire's Candide; the poetic masterpiece of Dante's Inferno; the great drama pioneered by Shakespeare and MoliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re; and other works of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment.\n\nWith the coming of the modern world, you'll trace the rise of Realism in the works of Flaubert, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and Ibsen and the development of experimental modes by Brecht, Beckett, Borges, Rushdie, and Pirandello.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Lecture Titles:\n\n1.
