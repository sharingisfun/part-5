The key is a static activation key. So that means that the product key is from Microsoft, and that it has no reason to be activated and is 100% genuine in validating.

Another key benefit of Outlook 2003 is the improved junk mail filter. Tablet and pen support was introduced in the productivity applications. Word 2003 introduced a reading layout view, document comparison, better change-tracking and annotation/reviewing, a Research Task Pane, voice comments and an XML-based format among other features. Excel 2003 introduced list commands, some statistical functions and XML data import, analysis and transformation/document customization features. Access 2003 introduced a backup command, the ability to view object dependencies, error checking in forms and reports among other features.\n\nSmart tag recognizers were added to PowerPoint and Access. FrontPage 2003 introduced conditional formatting, Find and Replace for HTML elements, new tools for creating and formatting tables and cells, dynamic templates (Dreamweaver), Flash support, WebDAV and SharePoint publishing among other features. Information Rights Management capabilities were introduced in document productivity applications to limit access to a set of users and/or restrict types of actions that users could perform. Support for managed code add-ins as VSTO solutions was introduced.\nAn example of the new Office icon and splash screen in PowerPoint 2003\n\nOffice 2003 is the last version of Office to include several features such as fully customizable toolbars and menus for all of its applications, the Office Assistant, the ability to slipstream service packs into the original setup files, Office Web Components, Save My Settings Wizard, allowing users to choose whether to keep a locally cached copy of installation source files and several utility resource kit tools. It is also the last Office version to support Windows 2000. A new picture organizer with basic editing features, called Microsoft Office Picture Manager replaced Microsoft Photo Editor. Because WinHelp has been deprecated, context-sensitive help (What's This help) is removed in Office 2003. [1]\n\nOnly basic clipart and templates were included on the disc media, with most content hosted online and downloadable from within the Office application. Microsoft advertised Office Online as a major Office 2003 feature &quot;outside the box&quot;. [2] Office Online provides how-to articles, tips, training courses, templates, clip art, stock photos and media and downloads (including Microsoft and third-party extensibility add-ins for Microsoft Office programs).\n\nThe last cumulative update for Office 2003, Service Pack 3 resolves several compatibility and stability issues with Windows Vista and later operating systems. Mainstream support for Office 2003 application ends in April 2009 and extended support ends in January 2014. [3]\n\n[edit] Enterprise features\n\nOffice 2003 features broad XML integration (designing customized XML schemas, importing and transforming XML data) throughout resulting in a far more data-centric model (instead of a document-based one). The MSXML 5 library was introduced specifically for Office's XML integration. Office 2003 also has tight SharePoint integration to facilitate data exchange, collaborated workflow and publishing. InfoPath was introduced for collecting data in XML-based forms and templates based on information from databases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e962542b1ecd9ce856fc6dc9c7d18c74e2f1e293","amp;dn":"Office+2003+Enterprise+Edition+w%2F+setup+key+activation+bypass+%2F%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e962542b1ecd9ce856fc6dc9c7d18c74e2f1e293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,98,84,43,30,205,156,232,86,252,109,201,199,209,140,116,226,241,226,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
