It contains poison which will cause one to lose our memory. Memories are central to the story, as the characters involved are questioned as to whether their memories are faulty, and if one can choose to repress them in the attempt to forget, be they happier times, or times of woe.\n\nJade (Rainie Yang) is an Internet web-cam girl, living with her grandma, and making a living out of smut, enticing men to trade money for moments of online peek-a-boo pleasure. She has a love since 9 years of age, and it is the relationship with Takeko (Isabella Leong), a tattooist, that forms the fulcrum of the story. Takeko herself bears a strong spider lily tattoo on her left arm, and it is something that Jade wants for herself, trying to rekindle and capture memories of her lost love, now found again.\n\nThere had been a recent fad about tattoos, nevermind the negative connotations once associated with this permanent body art. Perhaps this movie will change opinions about tattoos, as it opens your mind to specifics as to the reason behind each design, and the rationale that each person probably had when making their choices on a particular design. And as a plot device, it was a hand in glove, a tattoo&amp;#039;s powerful symbolism of hiding real intentions or emotions behind, or to feed off its perceived energy and possessing the design&amp;#039;s qualities.\n\nSpider Lilies has fine editing which serves the movie extremely well in engaging the audience with the characters&amp;#039; past. In fact, the rich back stories created for the characters make the story very compelling to watch. If there is a chink in the armour, then it&amp;#039;s the characterization of Takeko&amp;#039;s brother Ching (Shen Jian-hung), who is a bit slow in mental intelligence, and spends a lot of screen time pouting for his sister&amp;#039;s attention, which totally messes up her social life, out of love and obligation to provide the only family care for him.\n\nThe fear and pain of being forgotten in a modern society might resonate with many, and anyone who has spent enough time on the internet, will know that its anonymity can often lead to misunderstandings. That subplot perhaps added a touch of lightness coupled with a tinge of sadness and irony. As most youths today turn to the net as an outlet for expression, most will be able to identify with this portion of the story arc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:527bb6f66e5b71616594b061091f3e6d9763d10b","amp;dn":"Spider.Lilies.2007.lezmovie.DVDrip.Engsub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"527bb6f66e5b71616594b061091f3e6d9763d10b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,123,182,246,110,91,113,97,101,148,176,97,9,31,62,109,151,99,209,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
