The first acknowledged tune of the genre, &quot;Tristezas,&quot; was composed in Santiago by Pepe S?nchez during the late 1800s. The form was descended from a Spanish waltz-like dance of the same name, which in turn evolved from the French contradanse and, even earlier on, from English rural styles. Strangely, Ferrer had repeatedly been told that his voice was not sufficiently &quot;manly&quot; for these leisurely, achingly romantic ballads. But judging by the present tracks--and despite the inevitable depredations of age, which only give his interpretations an added, rueful vulnerability--this is demonstrably untrue. The singer's reedy tenor, in some cases rescued from high-quality demos with instrumentals recorded posthumously, touches places in a listener's soul that no power-popster with an umpteen-octave range and mud-slides of melisma could remotely approach. Ferrer is joined by BVSC band-mates Ruben Gonzalez (piano) and Omara Portuondo (vocals) on one tune each and is accompanied by the soulfully rinky-tink piano of Roberto Fonseca, Orlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; Lopez's sinuous, resonant acoustic bass and Manuel Galban's sensitive guitar, with Ramses Rodrigues and Emilio del Monte manning trap drums and percussion. Overall, Mi Suen~o (&quot;My Dream&quot;) has a late-night feeling, as though captured amid an after-hours jam in a smoky, malt-scented Havana nightclub, long after sleeves have been pushed up and chairs piled on the tables. --Christina Roden\n(Amazon.com editorial review)\n\nFiles\n01- Dos Almas.mp3\n02- Si Te Contara.mp3\n03- Melodia Del Rio.mp3\n04- Cada Noche Un Amor.mp3\n05- Deuda.mp3\n06- Uno.mp3\n07- Convergencia.mp3\n08- Quiereme Mucho.mp3\n09- Perfidia.mp3\n10- Copla Guajira.mp3\n11- Quizas, Quizas.mp3\n12- Alma Libre.mp3\nrelase-notes.txt\n\nAlbum cover encoded in each track (Visible in iTunes, Winamp, others)\nFormat: MP3, CBR 320 Kbit/s, 44100, stereo. encoders Xing, LAME 3.93.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari&lt;/a&gt;\n\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b844d3592aa0dc03e8d06d1cda153a202487733c","amp;dn":"%28Buena+Vista+Social+Club%29+Ibrahim+Ferrer+-+Mi+Sueno+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b844d3592aa0dc03e8d06d1cda153a202487733c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,68,211,89,42,160,220,3,232,208,109,28,218,21,58,32,36,135,115,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
