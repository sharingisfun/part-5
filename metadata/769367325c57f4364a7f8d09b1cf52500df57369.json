In addition to her studies, she works for a major scientific research firm, where her task is to be a companion to a silent, withdrawn, possibly autistic math genius. After failing her gruelling psych exam for the sixth time, however, she decides to lower her ethical standards a notch or ten and have a black-market memory-booster chip implanted in her arm to guarantee a passing grade next time around. The chip is successful, but seems to have some strange side effects, and Edit is soon gobbling iron-supplement pills like an addict. Something is going on inside her, and whatever this mysterious condition may be, it is of great interest to the company she works forÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nAnd so begins SerbiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first animated feature film, an energetic, eye-popping cyberpunk thrill ride thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scientifically calibrated to knock the socks off fans of Japanese anime and European bandes dessinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©es alike. TECHNOTISE: EDIT &amp; I certainly owes a debt to JapanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s animated cyberpunk classics (watch for a clever little wink at AKIRA), but unlike the obviously influential GHOST IN THE SHELL, it dials down the postmodern philosophical ramblings to a tolerable level and instead offers plenty of that hard-edged black humour so characteristic of Serbs. Aesthetically, though, TECHNOTISE: EDIT &amp; I is a feast for fans of Euro-sci-fi comics ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Moebius and MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tal Hurlant. No surprise, as in addition to being a well-established illustrator at home, the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writer/director Aleksa Gajic is known across the continent for his comic books with prominent French publisher Soleil. His debut film is a sequel to his popular graphic novella ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTechnotise,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and his remarkable strengths at the drawing board come through in every frameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a shame to see the film just once because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so packed with delightfully distinctive and carefully drafted little visual details and devices. Lovers of well-crafted, futuristic animation for discerning adults have long been stuck with Japan as their exclusive source, but TECHNOTISE: EDIT &amp; I proves that Eastern Europe, which already has a rich history in the medium, is loaded with exciting potential.\n\nIn technical terms, the film is combination of four kinds of animations. The movie features realistic drawing with static scenes, with emphasized atmosphere and with authentic artistic expression. It also combines classic 2D, improved 3D and vector animation, with few scenes done with fractal animation.\n\nThe stylistic inspiration for the movie was Japanese anime.\n\nHeat Vision is reporting that Legendary Pictures is developing a live-action remake of the animated Serbian film, Technotise: Edit and I.\n\nThe company has picked up a pitch by Laeta Kalogridis (Avatar, Shutter Island) who will write the screenplay. Rae Sanchini, who worked with James Cameron on Solaris, Titanic and Strange Days, will produce alongside Thomas Tull and Jon Jashni of Legendary Pictures.\n\nThe Serbian movie is set in Belgrade in the year 2074 and centers on a failing art student who decides to get a chip implant to circumvent studying but gets more than she bargained for.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:769367325c57f4364a7f8d09b1cf52500df57369","amp;dn":"Technotise+-+Edit+i+ja+%28eng+subs%29+%5B2009%5D+Aleksa+Gajic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"769367325c57f4364a7f8d09b1cf52500df57369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,147,103,50,92,87,244,54,74,127,141,9,177,207,82,80,13,245,115,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
