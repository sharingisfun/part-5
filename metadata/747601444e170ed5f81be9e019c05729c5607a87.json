The band originally consisted of Mark Holmes from Mansfield, England on vocals and bass, Sergio Galli on guitar and Chris Steffler on drums. Scottish musician Kenny MacLean later joined the group as bassist, freeing Holmes from bass duties.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlatinum Blonde originated in 1981 as a tribute band performing the music of The Police in Canada's university and club circuit. In 1982, they signed to CBS Records Canada and released a self-titled six-song EP, which made it to No. 39 on the Canadian album charts. It was quickly expanded into a full length album titled Standing in the Dark, which featured identical artwork to the EP. The LP version then received a wide release distribution deal through CBS America.\n\nThe band's popularity on the airwaves in Canada led to a triple platinum (300,000) album, featuring four hits including two Juno Award nominations: &quot;Standing in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Doesn't Really Matter&quot;. Their music videos were placed into high rotation on Canada's Much Music television and play listed as well on MTV America &amp; MTV EUR.\n\nIn 1985, the band released a second album called Alien Shores, featuring the addition of a fourth member, Kenny MacLean. &quot;Alien Shores&quot; went quintuple platinum (500,000), the group's high-water mark of success. Hits from the second album included &quot;Situation Critical&quot;, &quot;Crying Over You&quot;, &quot;Somebody Somewhere&quot;, and &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot;.\n\nIn 1988 the band's next album, Contact was a hit in Canada, going double platinum, but was significantly less successful than their previous record. The title track &quot;Contact&quot; was a modest hit, but the album was a commercial disappointment, and they were dropped by CBS. Platinum Blonde changed their name to The Blondes and recorded and released one further album Yeah Yeah Yeah before disbanding.\n\nThe entire group appeared as alien bikers in the 1988 episode Eye for an Eye of the television series War of the Worlds.\n\nIn 2002, Mark Holmes and partners opened the acclaimed Mod Club Theatre on College Street in Toronto CAN. The Mod Club Theatre has showcased the likes of Muse, Amy Winehouse, MGMT, The Killers, The Ruby Spirit, Keane, Feist and more.\n\nRumors of a reunion of the original band, and possibly some new material, continued to swirl, as the band played a few charity concerts in the mid-2000s. A DVD video compilation entitled Platinum Blonde: The Complete DVD Collection, containing all of their music videos was in production but ultimately shelved by CBS as they were bought out by Sony Music that same year.\n\nIn November 2008, Holmes took up McLeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-standing offer to make a guest appearance at one of his shows at the Mod Club, this time to mark the release of his third solo CD entitled Completely. McLean had commented to Holmes Ã¢â‚¬Å“hundreds of timesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that Platinum Blonde should re-unite. Holmes quotes McLean as saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s get back together. Music doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have any rock stars anymore.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Holmes always replied that he was too busy with his DJ career, but this time he agreed and they performed a collection of Platinum Blonde hits. MacLean died of a heart attack three hours after the show ended in his recording studio on Yonge Street in Toronto. His body was found there on November 24, 2008.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeven Year Itch: 1982-1989 is a compilation album of songs by Platinum Blonde. The 1999 album was released on record label Sony Music Direct as a compact disc and cassette. Music critic Mike DeGagne, of Allmusic, calls the release &quot;...a worthy summation of [Platinum Blonde's] five year existence.&quot; \n\nThe album is notable as it is the only available release on CD of material from Platinum Blonde's first two albums (Standing in the Dark and Alien Shores).\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:747601444e170ed5f81be9e019c05729c5607a87","amp;dn":"Platinum+Blonde+-+Seven+Year+Itch+1982-1989+%5B1999%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"747601444e170ed5f81be9e019c05729c5607a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,118,1,68,78,23,14,213,248,27,233,224,25,192,87,41,197,96,122,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
