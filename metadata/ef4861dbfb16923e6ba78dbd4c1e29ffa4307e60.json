Comedian Bob Newhart portrayed a psychologist having to deal with his patients and fellow office workers. The show was filmed before a live audience.\n\nPremise\n\nThe popular CBS series stars Newhart as Robert Hartley, Ph.D., a Chicago psychologist. The show divided most of its action between the character's home life and work, with Suzanne Pleshette as Hartley's supportive (though occasionally sarcastic) wife Emily, and Bill Daily as their friendly but inept neighbor, airline navigator Howard Borden. At the medical office where Hartley had his psychology practice, Peter Bonerz appeared as Jerry Robinson, D.D.S., an orthodontist who shared the office suite, and Marcia Wallace portrayed their joke-loving receptionist, Carol Kester (later Kester-Bondurant).\n\nTwo of Hartley's more memorable regular patients were the mean-spirited and neurotic Elliot Carlin (Jack Riley) and the milquetoast Marine veteran Emil Peterson (John Fiedler). (Carlin was ranked 49th in TV Guide's List of the 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time, and Riley reprised the character in guest appearances on both St. Elsewhere and Newhart.)\n\nMost of the situations involved Newhart's character playing straight man to his wife, colleagues, friends and patients, an extension of Newhart's stand-up comedy routines, where Newhart would play one side of a telephone conversation, the other side of which was not heard. Emily routinely acted as straight man to dimwitted Howard, and on occasion to Bob.\n\nCast\n\nBob Newhart as Dr. Robert Hartley, psychologist\nSuzanne Pleshette as Emily Hartley (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Harrison), his wife, a school teacher\nBill Daily as Howard Borden, their next-door neighbor, an airline navigator; becomes Bob's brother-in-law\nPeter Bonerz as Dr. Jerry Robinson, Bob's friend, an orthodontist\nMarcia Wallace as Carol Kester, their receptionist\n\nBob's patients\n\nJack Riley as Elliot Carlin (29 episodes)\nRenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Lippin as Michelle Nardo (15)\nFlorida Friebus as Mrs. Lillian Bakerman (10)\nJohn Fiedler as Mr. Emil Peterson (9)\nOliver Clark as Mr. Ed Herd (6)\nNoam Pitlik as Mr. Victor Gianelli (5)\nDaniel J.
