Pathos and dry humour (a Nail trademark)abound in a colourful and varied story which successfully mixes action, romance, mystery and music. The music, performed and mostly written by Nail, who also wrote the series, is excellent. It makes the story all the more believable - the soundtrack album really did make a singing star out of Jimmy Nail. North American viewers may find the Newcastle accents hard to follow.\n\n\nPlease note This is not my rip I got this elsewhere We must thank the original uploader = &quot;pgarbutt &quot; for making this series available i have looked at it and it is what it says its a TV VHS RIP so the quality is not like a dvd rip but it is still very watchable. Once again thanks to the original ripper.\n\n\nOriginal ripper notes\n\n\n\n\nCrocodile Shoes - Series 1\n==========================\n\n&quot;Wine, beer and spirits all the time.

IFO Edit was used to clean the VOBs and produce workable IFOs so that they'd go into TMPEGEnc. I had to use v1.6 of TMPEG, as v2.0 refused to load the cleaned VOBs - I don't know why and I have got the latest version too!\n\nUPDATE: Before I got a hold of TMPG3, I'd authored to DVD format using 1.6..didn't try direct to AVI using TMPG3...future releases (Crocdile Shoes 2, Spender etc) will be direct. Using Clone DVD Mobile produced out-of-sync audio AVIs!\n\nIf anyone has the sell-thru VHS of the series, I'll gladly transfer those instead!\n\nPlease keep this NFO with the episodes so that people know how they were made and who done the work.\n\nJust remember - if this comes out on official DVD then buy it.\nThese DivX files are for archival purposes until that time, OK?!\nENJOY THIS RARELY-SEEN SERIES!\n\n\n\n\nI Have Also Included The Original Sound Track From This Series\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Nail - Crocodile Shoes - OST (1994)[EAC-MP3@320KBPS]\n\nTrack list\n\nJimmy Nail - Crocodile Shoes\n\n01.

His next TV work, Spender, was a labor of love; he wrote and produced the series, starring as undercover detective Freddie Spender as well. He won several awards for the show, which also launched a best-selling novel. More awards were forthcoming for his series Crocodile Shoes, in which he played a third-rate country singer. Nail began recording in the mid-'80s, and first gained an American contract with the 1992 album Growing Up in Public. His 1995 LP Crocodile Shoes -- based on the TV series -- went triple-platinum in Great Britain (and spawned a best-selling follow-up one year later). In 1996, Jimmy Nail earned his most popular role, that of tango singer AgustÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­n Magaldi in Madonna's feature-film version of Evita.\n\nReview From Amazon.co.uk\n\nLike the very nose on his face, Jimmy Nail is a man going in two directions. Despite being one of Britain's most in-demand actors, he's always cited singing as his true vocation. In 1994, Nail was afforded the luxury of not having to choose when he was landed the lead in a TV drama about a jobbing singer-songwriter. Crocodile Shoes was a project very close to Nail's heart. Despite a cluster of hits under his belt, this was Nail's major songwriting debut. One might infer from songs like &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot; and &quot;Bitter And Twisted&quot; that Nail is happiest in the pub rock idiom. Perhaps though, he was writing for the part. Either way, the standard of his compositions is predictably dwarfed by three submissions from Paddy MacAloon, including the single &quot;Cowboy Dreams&quot;. Lest we forget, the Prefab Sprout frontman cut his teeth on the Tyneside pub circuit. &quot;Love Will Find Someone For You&quot; and &quot;Dragons&quot; strike a balance between sentimentality and poetry that Nail would do well to mind.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b836cf2ba091b206c5895aa3a747342331be4d9e","amp;dn":"Crocodile+Shoes+-+BBC+TV+-+Series+One+-+%281994%29%28Jimmy+Nail%29TV+VHS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b836cf2ba091b206c5895aa3a747342331be4d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,54,207,43,160,145,178,6,197,137,90,163,167,71,52,35,49,190,77,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
