It was noted for featuring No Malice of Clipse on the song &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;, and for including production work from 9th Wonder, Boi-1da, S1 and Street Symphony. Label-mates Tedashii and Andy Mineo, as well as other fellow Christian hip-hop artists such as Dre Murray, Thi'sl, Swoope, Christon Gray, and Braille, also made appearances on the album. The mixtape was downloaded 100,000 times in 48 hours, and met with critical acclaim. It received controversy in Christian media upon its release due to its condemnation of hypocrisy in the Christian Church and Lecrae's collaboration with the mainstream producer Don Cannon. A shorter, remastered EP version was released on iTunes on June 25, 2012. The EP debuted at #10 on the Billboard Christian Albums and Gospel Albums charts.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:820c2d6acbcc3780660c8ea22b3237f9e8e0a8da","amp;dn":"Lecrae+-+Church+Clothes+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"820c2d6acbcc3780660c8ea22b3237f9e8e0a8da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,12,45,106,203,204,55,128,102,12,142,162,43,50,55,249,232,224,168,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
