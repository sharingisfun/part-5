Maths, though, isn't just a tool for solving a specific problem - and it's definitely not something to be afraid of. Whether you're a maths glutton or have forgotten how long division works (or never really knew in the first place), the chances are you've missed what really makes maths exciting. Calling on a baker's dozen of entertaining, puzzling examples and mathematically illuminating culinary analogies - including chocolate brownies, iterated Battenberg cakes, sandwich sandwiches, Yorkshire puddings and MÃƒÂ¶bius bagels - brilliant young academic and mathematical crusader Eugenia Cheng is here to tell us why we should all love maths.\n\nFrom simple numeracy to category theory ('the mathematics of mathematics'), Cheng takes us through the joys of the mathematical world. Packed with recipes, puzzles to surprise and delight even the innumerate, Cake, Custard &amp; Category Theory will whet the appetite of maths whizzes and arithmophobes alike. (Not to mention aspiring cooks: did you know you can use that slow cooker to make clotted cream?) This is maths at its absolute tastiest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ee71191d58bfe682bd45ddfc706cf70165201d","amp;dn":"Cakes%2C+Custard+and+Category+Theory%3A+Easy+Recipes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ee71191d58bfe682bd45ddfc706cf70165201d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,238,113,25,29,88,191,230,130,189,69,221,252,112,108,247,1,101,32,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
