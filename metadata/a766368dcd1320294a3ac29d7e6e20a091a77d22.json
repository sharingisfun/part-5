It looks at how and why security evolved, why it works the way it does, and -- this is the timely part -- what is it about the information society that changes everything. Schneier will model the fundamental trade-off of societal security -- individual self-interest vs. societal group interest -- as a group prisoner's dilemma problem, and use that metaphor to examine the basic mechanics of societal security. Written in SchneierÃ‚â€™s engaging and riveting voice, the book will be divided into three parts: Understanding People, Understanding Security, and Understanding TodayÃ‚â€™s World. The first part covers the Natural History of Security, The Economics of Security, The Psychology of Fear and Risk, The Psychology of Security Trade-Offs, The Honest Majority, and The Dishonest Minority. The second part covers Societal Security, The PrisonerÃ‚â€™s Dilemma, Using Morals to Solve a PrisonerÃ‚â€™s Dilemma, Using Reputation to Solve a PrisonerÃ‚â€™s Dilemma, Using Rules to Solve a PrisonerÃ‚â€™s Dilemma, and Security Solutions for a PrisonerÃ‚â€™s Dilemma. And in the third part, he walks the reader through PrisonerÃ‚â€™s Dilemmas in a Market Economy, Organizations and the PrisonerÃ‚â€™s Dilemma, Why Does This Fail So Often?, The PrisonerÃ‚â€™s Dilemma in the Information Society, and The Future of Societal Security. He concludes with the rhetorical dialogue with the reader of Does Society Need a Dishonest Minority?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a766368dcd1320294a3ac29d7e6e20a091a77d22","amp;dn":"Liars+and+Outliers-Brice+Schneier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a766368dcd1320294a3ac29d7e6e20a091a77d22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,102,54,141,205,19,32,41,74,58,194,157,126,110,32,160,145,167,125,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
