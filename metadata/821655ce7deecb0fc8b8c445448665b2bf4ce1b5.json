What part did they play in our land s history? In Celtic Britain, Homer Sykes embarks on a fascinating journey though the mysterious landscapes and artifacts bequeathed to us by the Celts. Over 120 evocative photographs take us from Cornwall, through England, Wales and up to Scotland. We visit little-known sites that belong to pre-Celtic times, ruined cells where Celtic holy men performed Christian ceremonies during the Dark Ages, enigmatic sites such as Stonehenge, Avebury, and places that are shrouded in the mysteries of Arthurian legend. The powerful narrative explores the historical and archaeological evidence surrounding the myths, folktales and sites that are scattered throughout Britain: saints who saved lives by restoring heads to shoulders, eels that coiled around patients legs to cure them, the mystery of the bluestones at Carn Menyn, and many more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:821655ce7deecb0fc8b8c445448665b2bf4ce1b5","amp;dn":"Celtic+Britain+%28History+Photography+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"821655ce7deecb0fc8b8c445448665b2bf4ce1b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,22,85,206,125,238,203,15,200,184,196,69,68,134,101,178,191,76,225,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
