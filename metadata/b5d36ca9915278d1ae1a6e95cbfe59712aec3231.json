Released in 1996, My Generation: The Very Best of the Who was intended to be the definitive single-disc collection, replacing all the others that preceded it. While it is a very good collection, it just misses being a definitive sampler. Essentially, My Generation is a replica of Who's Better, Who's Best that adds four tracks that were missing from the previous compilation, including the seminal post-Tommy single &quot;The Seeker&quot; and the original single mix of &quot;Magic Bus.&quot; My Generation isn't strictly a singles collection, since it contains such album rock staples as &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and the full-length version of &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again.&quot; It also spans the group's entire career, so it has a bit of a scattershot feel to it -- &quot;You Better You Bet&quot; sounds a little odd next to tense early singles like &quot;Substitute&quot; and &quot;I Can See for Miles.&quot; The career-spanning approach doesn't make for as cohesive a collection as Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy, but it does mean that My Generation is an excellent -- even necessary -- introduction. There's a lot more in The Who's catalog that needs to be heard, but My Generation does boil down the most essential items (even though the abominable &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; is included) to a fine single-disc set.\nAll Music Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] I Can't Explain\n[02] Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\n[03] My Generation\n[04] Substitute\n[05] I'm A Boy\n[06] Boris The Spider\n[07] Happy Jack\n[08] Pictures Of Lily\n[09] I Can See For Miles\n[10] Magic Bus\n[11] Pinball Wizard\n[12] The Seeker\n[13] Baba O'Riley\n[14] Won't Get Fooled Again (Full Length Version)\n[15] Let's See Action\n[16] 5.15\n[17] Join Together\n[18] Squeeze Box\n[19] Who Are You (Single Edit Version)\n[20] You Better You Bet\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:16m:10s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 490mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
