The expansion is â€˜themedâ€™ in that it concentrates on those areas of policy where governments can influence the make-up of the electorate in subtle low-key ways over the long term. For example, subsidies to bicycles will encourage people to exercise more (in the long run decreasing health costs) and will also encourage less people to own cars and be members of the motorists group. Other policies to encourage entrepreneurship amongst young people will eventually lead to more people becoming self employed, and so onâ€¦\r\nA total of 26 policies and 8 dilemmas are included in the expansion, including food labelling, car-pooling, Labor Day bank holiday, witness protection schemes, a diplomatic service, armed forces week, free parenting classes, and much more. The social engineering expansion will allow you see the game as less of a simple win/lose challenge and more of a â€˜society sandboxâ€™ that gives you the power to change society over the long run whilst keeping everyone voting for you!\r\nBuild your own Great Society with all of the subtle tools of social engineering at your disposal!\r\nIncludes 26 new policies and 8 new political dilemmas.\r\nEnact new policies such as bicycle subsidies, needle exchange programs, or the young entrepreneur scheme amongst others.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10, Processor 2 GHz (Dual Core), 1 GB RAM (4 GB recommended), Directx 9.0c-compatible 3D graphics card with 256 MB VRAM, 500 MB HDD, DirectX 9.0c-compatible sound card, mouse, keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3745939237d1f770521718e61430eea5895ca711","amp;dn":"Democracy+3%3A+Social+Engineering+DLC+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3745939237d1f770521718e61430eea5895ca711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,69,147,146,55,209,247,112,82,23,24,230,20,48,238,165,137,92,167,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
