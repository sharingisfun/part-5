This is our year...... knock on wood!!!!\n\nFrom wikipedia;\nMike Bassett: England Manager is a 2001 satirical comedy film directed by Steve Barron, following the fortunes of the manager of Division One football club Norwich City, Mike Bassett, who having led his side to the 'Mr Clutch Cup', is appointed England manager.\nThe film takes the form of a fly-on-the-wall fictional documentary (mockumentary) following Bassett (played by Ricky Tomlinson) as he starts his international management career. Martin Bashir, well known as a journalist and presenter in real life, plays the interviewer and provides the voice-over, and the film features cameo appearance s from PelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and Ronaldo. The film satirises many targets, such as the mysterious figures who run the Football Association, the stereotypical view of an old-fashioned manager, and the tabloid press 's unfailing habit of building the England team up so they can knock them down hard.\nOnly mentioned once, the film is set at the 2002 World Cup, as it is referred to as 'World Cup XVII', which would be the 17th World Cup which was the tournament in 2002.\nThe film was followed by a TV series, Mike Bassett: Manager in 2005\n\nLink to a vlc snapshot to see the quality (or lack there of) of the file:\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/9030/vlcsnap2010052000h34m26.jpg\n\nMike Bassett - England Manager.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 822 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 341 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nCodec ID                         : DIVX\nCodec ID/Info                    : Project Mayo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 4\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate                         : 1 200 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nStandard                         : PAL\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.116\nStream size                      : 735 MiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : avc2.0.11.1110\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 78.5 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5e3732569f8230be329ca0c3e29e513db072acb","amp;dn":"Mike+Bassett+-+England+Manager.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5e3732569f8230be329ca0c3e29e513db072acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,227,115,37,105,248,35,11,227,41,202,12,62,41,229,19,219,7,42,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
