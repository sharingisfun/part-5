Most of the album was co-written by Jacques Levy, and is composed of lengthy story-songs, two of which quickly generated controversy: the over-11-minute long &quot;Joey&quot;, which is seen as glorifying the violent gangster &quot;Crazy Joey&quot; Gallo, and &quot;Hurricane&quot;, the opening track that tells a passionate account of the murder case against boxer Rubin Carter, whom the song asserts was framed. Carter was released in 1985, after a judge overturned his conviction on appeal.\n\nA well-received follow-up to Blood on the Tracks, Desire reached #1 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart[1] for five weeks, becoming one of Dylan's top-selling studio albums (currently certified double platinum), while reaching #3 in the UK. It claimed the number one slot on NME Album of the Year. Rolling Stone named Desire #174 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Hurricane&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:33\n    &quot;Isis&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:58\n    &quot;Mozambique&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n    &quot;One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below)&quot; (Dylan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:43\n    &quot;Oh, Sister&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:05\n    &quot;Joey&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:05\n    &quot;Romance in Durango&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:50\n    &quot;Black Diamond Bay&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:30\n    &quot;Sara&quot; (Dylan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:29","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3698cc012931bee63005d21ad432522164a64fd8","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Desire+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3698cc012931bee63005d21ad432522164a64fd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,152,204,1,41,49,190,230,48,5,210,26,212,50,82,33,100,166,79,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
