For Backspacer, the lasting Grunge rockers decided to do it big. They left label J Records and decided to release to album themselves, since the certainly have enough money to do that. They also hooked up with '90s Alternative Rock producer du jour Brendan O'Brien (Korn, Bruce Springsteen), the first time that the band has worked with O'Brien since 1998's Yield. The music on the record features a sound influenced by pop and New Wave.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n \n\nPer commenti e recensioni in italiano visitate anche http://trfkad.baywords.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca024b0461fb1d1ff5ca248092163f0dabe05a03","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+Backspacer+%5Bmp3-320-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca024b0461fb1d1ff5ca248092163f0dabe05a03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,2,75,4,97,251,29,31,245,202,36,128,146,22,63,13,171,224,90,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
