In Hong Kong, three sisters, masters in the use of paper, run their own detective agency to solve cases that involve books. When these people are brought together, a bond greater than blood is formed - a bond that will be sorely tested by the evil powers intent on taking over the world.\n\nJoin Anita, Maggie, Michelle, and Nenene as they travel the globe in order to save the world from the evil mastermind, Mr. Carpenter! Of course, that's if they can find the time to put down the books they're reading.\n\nMedia Info\nVideo: 640 X 480 | Main @ L3.0 | CABAC/6 Ref Frames\n\nAudio: 44kHz | 2 Ch | AAC\n\nSubtitle: English (Hardcoded)\n\nSource: Crunchyroll (Untouched Rip)\n\n\nPlease SEED as long as you can to keep this torrent alive for others to enjoy too.\n\nCome and Join Us on IRC\n\nirc://irc.rizon.net/animerg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c252a1c0b68d28256c8dad750300738f4cebbc3","amp;dn":"%5BAnimeRG%5D+R.O.D+-+Read+Or+Die+TV+%28Complete1+-+26%29%28480p%29%5BXcelent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c252a1c0b68d28256c8dad750300738f4cebbc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,37,42,28,11,104,210,130,86,200,218,215,80,48,7,56,244,206,187,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
