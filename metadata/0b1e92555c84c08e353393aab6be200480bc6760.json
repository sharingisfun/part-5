In Akibiyori, a still-beautiful widow has a daughter who is sufficiently past the favored age for marriage to be in danger of becoming an old maid according to the norms of Japanese culture. Three mature men, friends of the family, get together to discuss the widow and her problem daughter. Despite the fact that they each would like to marry the mother, they agree that one of them should make the sacrifice of marrying the daughter. They discuss their marriage idea with the mother, not the daughter (as is customary). Somehow, the girl hears of it, and is infuriated. She has said all along that though she wants to get married someday, she wants to remain single for some time longer. Now she is angry enough to threaten to accept the family friend's suit simply out of spite.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Akibiyori (Ozu 1960) dvdrip.xvid.ac3-rulle.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.45 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 9mn\n      Bit rate : 1602 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.23 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 9mn\n      Bit rate : 1407 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.190\n      StreamSize : 1.27 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 2h 9mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 177 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0053579\n\nJapanese audio; English, Spanish, French and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by serdar202, Eclipse rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b1e92555c84c08e353393aab6be200480bc6760","amp;dn":"Yasujiro+Ozu+-+Akibiyori+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b1e92555c84c08e353393aab6be200480bc6760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,30,146,85,92,132,192,142,53,51,147,170,182,190,32,4,128,188,103,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
