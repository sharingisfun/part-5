Now, James are set to release a two-CD set, The Morning After The Night Before.\nThe two-disc set started as separate mini albums: The Night Before was released in the U.K. in April and The Morning After is set for release there this September. The Night Before takes James' knack for uplifting songs about insecurity, disaffection and mental illness to a new level, and The Morning After has an intuitive, low-key 'campfire' feel featuring some of the saddest, darkest lyrics Tim Booth has ever come up with.\n\nTim Booth\nJim Glennie\nLarry Gott\nSaul Davies\nMark Hunter\nDave Baynton-Power\nAndy Diagram\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01074cde9886352552e331bf2216939b0b0b0b2","amp;dn":"James+-+The+Morning+After+The+Night+Before+%282010%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01074cde9886352552e331bf2216939b0b0b0b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,16,116,205,233,136,99,82,85,46,51,27,242,33,105,57,176,176,176,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
