Epic Last Song \n\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nThe hottest act rising from the underground to the mainstream in 2008, DIOYY have had a roller coaster ride through 2007 to their imminent album release. They have gone from Myspace jokers with a cult following to playing Brixton academy in under a year, turning heads and critics along the way with their must-be-seen-t-be-believed raucous live show that prompted the NME to champion them weekly in the magazine and put them on the esteemed February awards tour with The Cribs among others. The momentum is firmly behind the band who launch this album to their core fanbase around the dancefloor and live monster single We Are Rockstars.\n\nThe album itself is currently wowing critics and doubters by not being a straight up set of electro bangers. You Have No Idea What YouÃƒâ€ re Getting Yourself Into delivers on its promise by mixing up their trademark electro rock with distinctly melodic synth pop tracks, whilst retaining coherent thread throughout the 10 tracks. More than just a novelty new rave act, DIOYY are serious about their music and as a result it is seriously good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:289be05e1a6dded911048566a1dd73eea061febe","amp;dn":"Does+It+Offend+You+Yeah%3F%21+-+You+Have+No+Idea+What+You%5C%27re+Gett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"289be05e1a6dded911048566a1dd73eea061febe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,155,224,94,26,109,222,217,17,4,133,102,161,221,115,238,160,97,254,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
