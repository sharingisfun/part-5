If it does not then just Browse (or explore) the disc and click on the &quot;Autostart&quot; file then click on Autorun. \n\nClick on &quot;Install Nero 7 Essentials&quot; and a new window will appear, click on the &quot;Nero 7 Essentials&quot; tab, follow the instructions and accept the terms and conditions, install and enjoy.   \n\nIt will auto matically come up with the Product Key, just put in your name and your Organization (if you want too)\n\nOnce you have installed the program you will need to do one more thing:\n\nClick Start&gt;all programs&gt;Nero 7 Essentials&gt;tools&gt;Nero Scout, once this is open uncheck the box that says &quot;Integrate Nero Scout in Windows Explorer&quot; the click apply.  After that then uncheck the box in the upper lefthand corner that says &quot;Enable Nero Scout&quot; and click apply, the click OK.  This will keep you from having an &quot;end task&quot; error every time you shut down or restart your computer.  This was something that I had to research my self to get it to stop.  It is some kind of glitch they have not yet worked out.\n\nIf that does not work please let me know.\n \nPrograms:\n\nNero Express 7 Essentials\nNero ShowTime 3 Essentials\nNero Vision 4 Essentials\nNero Recode 2 Essentials\nInCD 5 essentials\n \nAlso \n\nAdobe Reader \nand a User Manual\n\nI will seed this for 1-2 days and will see how it goes.\n\nSeed and Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef3d48b58b9e5a003e819f552f70bb9e9762db38","amp;dn":"NERO7+ESSENTIALS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef3d48b58b9e5a003e819f552f70bb9e9762db38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,61,72,181,139,158,90,0,62,129,159,85,47,112,187,158,151,98,219,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
