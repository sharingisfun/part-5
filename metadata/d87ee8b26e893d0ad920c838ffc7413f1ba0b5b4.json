BrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡s Cubas dedicates his book to the first worm that gnawed his cold body: &quot;To the worm who first gnawed on the cold flesh of my corpse, I dedicate with fond remembrance these Posthumous Memoirs.&quot; (in Portuguese: Ao verme que primeiro roeu as frias carnes do meu cadÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ver dedico com saudosa lembranÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§a estas MemÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³rias PÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³stumas.) Cubas decides to tell his story starting from the end (the passage of his death, ironically caused by pneumonia after inventing the &quot;Emplasto BrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡s Cubas&quot;, a supposedly revolutionary medicine), then taking &quot;the greatest leap in this story&quot;, proceeding to tell the story of his life since his childhood.\n\nThe novel is also connected to another Machado de Assis work, Quincas Borba, which features a character from the Memoirs (as a secondary character, despite the novel's name). It's a novel recalled as a major influence by many post-modern writers, such as John Barth or Donald Barthelme, not to mention just about every Brazilian writer in the 20th century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d87ee8b26e893d0ad920c838ffc7413f1ba0b5b4","amp;dn":"Memorias+Postumas%5BEpitaph+of+a+Small+Winner%5D%5BPosthumous+Memories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d87ee8b26e893d0ad920c838ffc7413f1ba0b5b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,126,232,178,110,137,61,10,217,32,200,56,255,199,65,63,27,160,181,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
