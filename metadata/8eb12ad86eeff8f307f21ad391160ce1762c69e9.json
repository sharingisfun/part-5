The program was originally part of the Playhouse Disney block intended for preschoolers. The story concerns a teddy bear special agent in training, who needs the help of viewers at home in order to complete his missions.\n\nThese were encoded by me, from my digital recordings off cable TV. I don't currently get the station these are airing on, so I figured I'd post all the episodes I had collected that weren't already available on TPB.\n\n\nIf you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment! And please continue to seed after your download completes, so that others can enjoy this great kids educational show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb12ad86eeff8f307f21ad391160ce1762c69e9","amp;dn":"Special+Agent+Oso+%2820+episodes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb12ad86eeff8f307f21ad391160ce1762c69e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,177,42,216,110,239,248,243,7,242,26,211,145,22,12,225,118,44,105,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
