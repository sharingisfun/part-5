Reminiscent of Bill CosbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fatherhood, Dad is Fat is sharply observed, explosively funny, and a cry for help from a man who has realized he and his wife are outnumbered in their own home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef3d9b961683899ad96bb622c7e143be06070e9f","amp;dn":"Dad+Is+Fat+Jim+Gaffigan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef3d9b961683899ad96bb622c7e143be06070e9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,61,155,150,22,131,137,154,217,107,182,34,199,225,67,190,6,7,14,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
