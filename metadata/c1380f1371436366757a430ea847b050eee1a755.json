You get to see the palaeontologists in their natural habitats, searching for and digging up bones, as well as many scenes set in museums, workshops and laboratories, with some major discoveries being shown or reconstructed - and reconstruction is what palaeontology is all about! Mixed in with this is CGI footage of the dinosaurs in their habitats, going about their business, which is mainly stamping about or hunting each other. The CGI is not of the standard of the BBC's Walking With Dinosaurs , but this is not that sort of programme - this one focuses on the modern-day discovery of the evidence for the dinosaurs, with illustrations / scenes of how those dinosaurs might have looked or behaved,\n\n\n1)  The Land Time Forgot \nThis programme takes us beyond the lush forests, roaring lions and the blazing sun of Africa to reveal the World's most remote and hard to reach dinosaur fossils known to exist. We follow paleontologist Paul Sereno and his team from the southern tip of Africa to the northern reaches of Morocco as we meet some of the most diverse dinosaurs to have roamed our World.\n\n2)  Ground Zero \nThis DVD focuses on dinosaurs found in South America and the hunt for the first dinosaur. The DVD's special features include direct scene access where you can jump between thematic sections such as Nomadic Dinosaurs, Small Dinosaurs, and Disaster in Tunisia, a trivia quiz to see how well you remember the information presented, and spotlighted dinosaurs where you can jump to the specific dinosaurs presented--Majungotholus, Rahonavis, Kirky, Carchardontosaurus, Deltadromeus, Spinosaurus, Brachiosaurus, and Massospondylus.\n\n3)  At the Ends of the Earth \nIn the searing heat of Australia and frozen wastes of Antarctica, the dinosaurs that ruled these lands were the toughest creatures that ever lived. Follow a path of over 3000 footprints left in soft clay, proof that dinosaurs lived in the deadly Outback.\n\n4)  Birth of the Giants \nFar beneath the ruins of Europe's glorious civilisations lies an even more ancient World when dinosaurs were kings. From the Isle of Wight to Los Hoyas in Spain, leading paleontologists trace the rise and fall of the European dinosaurs.\n\n5)  Asia the Land of the Dragon \nThis programme looks at the major dinosaur discoveries made in China and Mongolia, including &quot;cutting edge science, extraordinary locations and intrepid scientists. In addition to its unique dino-birds, China boasts the greatest number of dinosaur eggs and embryos in the world&quot;; not to mention the secret origin of the T-Rex...\n\n6)  Beyond T Rex \nEveryone knows that the T-Rex was the King of the Dinosaurs, the fiercest and meanest flesh eater of them all. However, Beyond T-Rex scours the area from Morocco to Patagonia to unearth two new killer dinosaurs, Giganotosaurus and Carcharadontosaurus, who could have been even more ruthless.\n\n7)  Tyrannosaurus Rex \nWas T-Rex the most fearsome predator of all time or a simple scavenger? Did he ponderously stalk his prey or was he as fleet-footed as a bird? Was he actually a doting parent and not the fierce killer he's been portrayed to be? From its origins to its downfall, this programme looks for clues that can fill in the crucial details and unlock the mysteries of the T-Rex.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/1332/fycg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/1332/fycg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/1057/eyom.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/1057/eyom.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/2112/bepg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/2112/bepg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2808/5lbx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2808/5lbx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/7231/6fdw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/7231/6fdw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3040/2bwk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3040/2bwk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/8084/40dt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/8084/40dt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4084/6lam.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4084/6lam.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/5470/lahy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/5470/lahy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e3ab8a848ba3afd7cdd3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1864 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 960 x 540\n * Video: Resolution: for Part 7 = 720x480\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 52mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 7\n * Part Size: average 694 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.neoseeker.com/Movies/Products/when_dinosaurs_ruled_the_real_jurassic_park/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.neoseeker.com/Movies/Products/when_dinosaurs_ruled_the_real_jurassic_park/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1380f1371436366757a430ea847b050eee1a755","amp;dn":"When+Dinosaurs+Ruled+7of8+Tyrannosaurus+Rex+DVDRip+x264+AAC+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1380f1371436366757a430ea847b050eee1a755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,56,15,19,113,67,99,102,117,122,67,14,168,71,176,80,238,225,167,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
