His political philosophy influenced the French Revolution as well as the overall development of modern political, sociological and educational thought.\r\n\r\nThe centerpiece of this collection are the multiple volumes comprising THE COLLECTED WRITINGS OF ROUSSEAU, edited by Christopher Kelly and Roger D. Masters, and published for Darmouth College by the University Press of New England (1989-2010).\r\n\r\nForemost among the books included are Rousseau's novel Ã‰MILE: or, ON EDUCATION, a treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship (&quot;the best and most important of all my writings&quot;); JULIE, or THE NEW HELOISE, a sentimental novel that was central to the development of romanticism in fiction; the CONFESSIONS, which initiated the genre of modern autobiography; REVERIES OF A SOLITARY WALKER, which emplified the late 18th-century movement known as the Age of Sensibility, and featured an increased focus on subjectivity and introspection that later characterized modern writing; and THE SOCIAL CONTRACT and DISCOURSE ON THE ORIGIN OF INEQUALITY, both cornerstones of modern political and social thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\r\n\r\n* BASIC POLITICAL WRITINGS (Hackett, 1987).
