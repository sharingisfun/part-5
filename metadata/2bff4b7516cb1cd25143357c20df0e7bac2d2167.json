It was the band's second self-titled album; the first being their 1968 album.\n\nThe album peaked at number one on the Billboard charts, and set a record for most weeks on the chart before reaching the top position (broken in 1989, when Paula Abdul's Forever Your Girl took 64 weeks to reach #1). It sold 4.5 million copies and launched three Top Twenty singles: &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, the last two falling just short of the Top Ten, both at #11. This is also the first album to feature both Lindsey Buckingham as guitarist and Stevie Nicks as vocalist, after Bob Welch departed the band, late in 1974.\n\nUntil the release of this album, Fleetwood Mac's albums generally sold around a quarter million copies. This album helped launch them as musical superstars with an almost constant radio presence (which would be continued with their even more popular follow-up, Rumours). In 2003, the album was ranked number 181 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\n   1. &quot;Monday Morning&quot; (Buckingham) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n   2. &quot;Warm Ways&quot; (C.
