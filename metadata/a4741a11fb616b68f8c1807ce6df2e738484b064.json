The original line-up consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals, percussion, keyboards), Kate Pierson (organ, bass, vocals), Cindy Wilson (vocals, bongos, tambourine, guitar), Ricky Wilson (guitars), and Keith Strickland (drums, guitars, synthesizers, various instruments). Following Ricky Wilson's death in 1985 Strickland switched full-time to guitar. The band subsequently added various musicians for their live shows. This included Sara Lee or Tracy Wormworth on (bass), Zachary Alford or Sterling Campbell on (drums, percussion) and Pat Irwin or Paul Gordon (keyboards &amp; guitars).\n\nRooted in new wave and 1960s rock and roll, the group later covered many genres ranging from post-punk to pop rock. The &quot;guy vs. gals&quot; vocals of Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson, sometimes used in call and response style (&quot;Strobe Light,&quot; &quot;Private Idaho&quot;, and &quot;Good Stuff&quot;), are a trademark.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe B-52's is the eponymous debut album by the Athens, Georgia-based new wave rock band The B-52's. The kitschy lyrics and mood, and the hook-laden harmonies helped establish a fanbase for the band, who went on to release several chart-topping singles. The album cover was designed by Tony Wright (credited as Sue Ab Surd).\n\nThe B-52's peaked at number 59 on the Billboard 200,[1] and &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; reached number 56 on the Hot 100. In 2003, the television network VH1 named The B-52's the 99th greatest album of all time. Shortly before his death, John Lennon said he enjoyed the album. In his 1995 book, The Alternative Music Almanac, Alan Cross placed the album ninth on the list of 10 Classic Alternative Albums. In 2003, the album was ranked number 152 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWild Planet is the second studio album by The B-52's, released in 1980.\n\nAs with their first album, The B-52's traveled to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to record Wild Planet. Several of the songs from the album had been concert staples since 1977 but were omitted from the first album by choice of the producer, Chris Blackwell. More emphasis was put on production for Wild Planet.[citation needed] It was fairly well received by critics, most of whom regarded it as a strong second album following the success of their first. Wild Planet was quickly certified gold.\n\nDirector Gus Van Sant thanks the band in the credits of the 1991 film My Own Private Idaho for the use of the song title, &quot;Private Idaho.&quot; The song itself is not referred to anywhere in the movie.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhammy! is the third studio album by new wave band The B-52's. It was recorded at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, in December 1982 and was produced by Steven Stanley. The record was refined and mastered at Sterling Sound, New York City. It was released on April 27, 1983 in the United States, with Warner Bros. Records as the primary label. Sales for Whammy! were generally weaker than their previous album, but overall successful, spawning the popular singles &quot;Legal Tender&quot;, &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot;, and &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;. The album entered the Billboard 200 twice in 1983, reaching both number 29 and 171 throughout the year, while &quot;Legal Tender&quot; reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Singles chart alongside its two respective singles.\n\nThe B-52's' goal was to craft an album that would return to the New Wave sound and atmosphere of their debut album while updating their signature sound with drum machines and synthesizers, a slight contrast to their previous 1982 EP Mesopotamia, produced by David Byrne of Talking Heads who was intent on broadening the band's sound. The band created Whammy! with a stronger emphasis on the themes of sexuality, heterosexual dating, and gambling addiction. Two of the album's original singles, &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot; and &quot;Legal Tender&quot;, as well as the song &quot;Queen of Las Vegas&quot;, exemplify these themes respectively. The album was also the first to feature vocal performances by all five members of the band, as exemplified in the song &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;. The album's seventh track, &quot;Don't Worry&quot;, a cover version of the Yoko Ono song &quot;Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)&quot;, from her 1971 album Fly; however, the song was removed during later pressings due to legal issues with Ono. On subsequent pressings, the song was replaced with &quot;Legal Tender&quot;'s B-side, &quot;Moon 83&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€a remake of their earlier track &quot;There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)&quot;.\n\nThe B-52's' new musical directions and simplified lyrics divided critics. Reviewers generally treated Whammy! as weaker than their first two albums The B-52's and Wild Planet, but overall stronger than their previous album Mesopotamia.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBouncing off the Satellites is the fourth studio album by new wave band The B-52's, released on September 8, 1986. It was recorded in July 1985 and was produced by Tony Mansfield. Guitarist Ricky Wilson died of AIDS just over one month after the album's release. With the band too distraught to tour, the album received minimal promotion and failed to yield any hits despite some stations initially giving good airplay to &quot;Summer of Love&quot;. The album was seen as a departure from the band's original new wave sound; as a result, the album was initially a critical and commercial failure.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCosmic Thing is the fifth studio album by new wave band The B-52's, released in 1989. It contains the singles &quot;Love Shack&quot; and &quot;Roam,&quot; which remain two of their most popular tunes. The success of the album served as a comeback after the death of former guitarist Ricky Wilson in 1985.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4741a11fb616b68f8c1807ce6df2e738484b064","amp;dn":"The+B-52%27s+-+Original+Album+Series+%5B5+CD%27s%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4741a11fb616b68f8c1807ce6df2e738484b064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,116,26,17,251,97,107,104,248,193,128,124,230,223,46,115,132,132,176,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
