After yet another online dating disaster, Amy Webb was about to cancel her JDate membership when an epiphany struck: It wasn't that her standards were too high, as women are often told, but that she wasn't evaluating the right data in suitors' profiles. That night Webb, an award-winning journalist and digital-strategy expert, made a detailed, exhaustive list of what she did and didn't want in a mate. The result: seventy-two requirements ranging from the expected (smart, funny) to the super-specific (likes selected musicals: Chess, Les MisÃƒÂ©rables. Not Cats. Must not like Cats!). Next she turned to her own profile. In order to craft the most compelling online presentation, she needed to assess the competition-so she signed on to JDate again, this time as a man. Using the same gift for data strategy that made her company the top in its field, she found the key words that were digital man magnets, analyzed photos, and studied the timing of women's messages, then adjusted her (female) profile to make the most of that intel. Then began the deluge-dozens of men wanted to meet her, men who actually met her requirements. Among them: her future husband, now the father of her child. Forty million people date online each year. Most don't find true love. Thanks to Data, a Love Story, their odds just got a whole lot better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4816e02a1c4efc8de1e9bee414393207c8bcd2e5","amp;dn":"Data%2C+A+Love+Story+-+How+I+Gamed+Online+Dating+To+Meet+My+Match+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4816e02a1c4efc8de1e9bee414393207c8bcd2e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,22,224,42,28,78,252,141,225,233,190,228,20,57,50,7,200,188,210,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
