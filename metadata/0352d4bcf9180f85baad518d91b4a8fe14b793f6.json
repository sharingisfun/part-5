A Duel of Nations dramatically depicts the world in which that war took place. In this, the first book in English to study in totality the diplomatic history of the Franco-Prussian War, David Wetzel draws extensively on private and official records, journalistic accounts, cabinet minutes, and public statements by key players to produce a book that is unmatched in the range and clarity of its analysis, its forceful characterizations, and its vivid language.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0352d4bcf9180f85baad518d91b4a8fe14b793f6","amp;dn":"Duel+of+Nations+%3A+Germany%2C+France%2C+and+the+Diplomacy+of+the+War+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0352d4bcf9180f85baad518d91b4a8fe14b793f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,82,212,188,249,24,15,133,186,173,81,141,145,180,168,254,20,183,147,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
