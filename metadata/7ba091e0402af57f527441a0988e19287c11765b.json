The Desperate Ones\n\n\nReview from AMG:\nHer own best accompanist (especially during the crossover-happy '60s), Nina Simone sings and plays on this 1970 LP. With strident vocals and a thoughtful piano backing, Simone makes her own a pair of radically different (though similarly fatalistic) compositions, Blind Willie Johnson's &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; and Randy Newman's I Think It's Going To Rain Today. Her version of &quot;Everyone's Gone to the Moon&quot; leans dangerously close to avant-garde overkill, but she returns with good performances on &quot;Compensation&quot; and &quot;Who Am I?&quot; A great moment comes when a tambourine finally joins her midway through Another Spring, and the lone jazz standard (I Get Along Without You Very Well) is given a touching performance. In an era when Simone often veered from crossover to experimental, Nina Simone and Piano! is undeniably difficult, but frequently rewarding.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ba091e0402af57f527441a0988e19287c11765b","amp;dn":"Nina+Simone+-+Nina+Simone+and+Piano%21+%5B1970%5D+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ba091e0402af57f527441a0988e19287c11765b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,160,145,224,64,42,245,127,82,116,65,160,152,142,25,40,124,17,118,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
