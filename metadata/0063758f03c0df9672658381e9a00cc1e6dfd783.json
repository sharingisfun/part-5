In 1988 he became the first writer in Arabic to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988.  The prize citation praised Mahfouz &quot;who, through works rich in nuance -- now clear-sightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous -- has formed an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind.&quot;\n\nMahfouz is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers of Arabic literature, along with Tawfiq el-Hakim, to explore themes of existentialism.  He published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of movie scripts, and five plays over a 70-year career.  Many of his works have been made into Egyptian and foreign films.  A student of philosophy and an avid reader, his works range from reimaginings of ancient myths to subtle commentaries on contemporary Egyptian politics and culture.  Mahfouz's stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo, where his characters, mostly ordinary people, try to cope with the modernization of society and the temptations of Western values.\n\nHis most famous work, the epic Cairo Trilogy, traces three generations of the family of tyrannical patriarch Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, who rules his household with a strict hand while living a secret life of self-indulgence.  PALACE WALK (1956) introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons -- the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal.  Al-Sayyid Ahmad's rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in PALACE OF DESIRE (1957), as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s.  SUGAR STREET (1957) brings Mahfouz's vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the aging patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB format as indicated:\n\n* ADRIFT ON THE NILE (Anchor, 1994).
