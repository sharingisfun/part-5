N . KING\n\nIn my opinion and a lot of other people King was not only a C expert, but had the gift to explain in an easily understood way, how to program in C. This Book is a revised copy of the one that is out there, I have added Bookmarks throughout the book in every Chapter and every section within those chapters. The menu is very neat and clean and I am pretty sure anyone who want's to learn C programming should start with this book and will appreciate the time I took to Place Extensive and Neat Bookmarks throughout the Book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14852683de008ca4672166df7175dbb087c59c9b","amp;dn":"C+Programming+A+Modern+Approach+2nd+Ed+by+K+N+King+-+Revised+w%2FB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14852683de008ca4672166df7175dbb087c59c9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,133,38,131,222,0,140,164,103,33,102,223,113,117,219,176,135,197,156,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
