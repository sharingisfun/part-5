Yet there was a time when curiosity was condemned. Neither Pandora nor Eve could resist the dangerous allure of unanswered questions, and all knowledge wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t equalÃ¢â‚¬â€for millennia it was believed that there were some things we should not try to know. In the late sixteenth century this attitude began to change dramatically, and in Curiosity: How Science Became Interested in Everything, Philip Ball investigates how curiosity first became sanctionedÃ¢â‚¬â€when it changed from a vice to a virtue and how it became permissible to ask any and every question about the world.\n \nLooking closely at the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, Ball vividly brings to life the age when modern science began, a time that spans the lives of Galileo and Isaac Newton. In this entertaining and illuminating account of the rise of science as we know it, Ball tells of scientists both legendary and lesser known, from Copernicus and Kepler to Robert Boyle, as well as the inventions and technologies that were inspired by curiosity itself, such as the telescope and the microscope. The so-called Scientific Revolution is often told as a story of great geniuses illuminating the world with flashes of inspiration. But Curiosity reveals a more complex story, in which the liberationÃ¢â‚¬â€and subsequent tamingÃ¢â‚¬â€of curiosity was linked to magic, religion, literature, travel, trade, and empire. Ball also asks what has become of curiosity today: how it functions in science, how it is spun and packaged for consumption, how well it is being sustained, and how the changing shape of science influences the kinds of questions it may continue to ask.\n \nThough proverbial wisdom tell us that it was through curiosity that our innocence was lost, that has not deterred us. Instead, it has been completely the contrary: today we spend vast sums trying to reconstruct the first instants of creation in particle accelerators, out of a pure desire to know. Ball refuses to let us take this desire for granted, and this book is a perfect homage to such an inquisitive attitude.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s15.postimg.org/lzegk77jv/Ball_Philip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s15.postimg.org/lzegk77jv/Ball_Philip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Ball&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Ball&lt;/a&gt;\nPhilip Ball (born 1962) is an English science writer. He is an editor for the journal Nature for over 20 years, for whom he continues to write regularly.He now writes a regular column in Chemistry World. He has contributed to publications ranging from New Scientist to the New York Times, The Guardian, the Financial Times and New Statesman. He is the regular contributor to Prospect magazine, and also a columnist for Chemistry World, Nature Materials and BBC Future. He has broadcast on many occasions on radio and TV, and in June 2004 he presented a three-part serial on nanotechnology, 'Small Worlds', on BBC Radio 4.\nBall's most-popular book is the 2004 Critical Mass: How One Things Leads to Another, winner of the 2005 Aventis Prize for Science Books. It examines a wide range of topics including the business cycle, random walks, phase transitions, bifurcation theory, traffic flow, Zipf's law, Small world phenomenon, catastrophe theory, the Prisoner's dilemma. The overall theme is one of applying modern mathematical models to social and economic phenomena.\nHe holds a degree in chemistry from Oxford and a doctorate in physics from Bristol University.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface vii\n1 Old Questions 1\n2 The Academies of Secrets 23\n3 The Theatre of Curiosity 49\n4 The Hunt of Pan 85\n5 Professors of Everything 113\n6 More Things in Heaven and Earth 145\n7 Cosmic Disharmonies 175\n8 The First Men in the Moon 215\n9 Nature Free and Bound 256\n10 On the Head of a Pin 287\n11 The Light of Nature 321\n12 Chasing Elephants 353\n13 Professional Virtuosi, or Curiosity Served Cold 389\nCast of Characters 411\nNotes 419\nBibliography 445\nImage Credits 455\nIndex 457","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8949838ac065b10cfa582320d7c825f97887e39","amp;dn":"Curiosity+-+How+Science+Became+Interested+in+Everything+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8949838ac065b10cfa582320d7c825f97887e39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,148,152,56,172,6,91,16,207,165,130,50,13,124,130,95,151,136,126,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
