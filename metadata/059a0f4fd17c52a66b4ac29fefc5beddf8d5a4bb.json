Only fifteen years old, Amy disappeared walking home from school one day and was found in a coma three days later. Her attacker was never identified and her angelic face was plastered across every paper and nightly news segment.\r\n\r\nFifteen years later, Amy lies in the hospital, surrounded by 90â€™s Britpop posters, forgotten by the world until reporter Alex Dale stumbles across her while researching a routine story on vegetative patients.\r\n\r\nRemembering Amyâ€™s story like it was yesterday, she feels compelled to solve the long-cold case.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is, Alex is just as lost as Amyâ€”her alcoholism has cost her everything including her marriage and her professional reputation.\r\n\r\nIn the hopes that finding Amyâ€™s attacker will be her own salvation as well, Alex embarks on a dangerous investigation, suspecting someone close to Amy.\r\n\r\nTold in the present by an increasingly fragile Alex and in dream-like flashbacks by Amy as she floats in a fog of memories, dreams, and music from 1995, Try Not to Breathe unfolds layer by layer to a breathtaking conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:059a0f4fd17c52a66b4ac29fefc5beddf8d5a4bb","amp;dn":"Try+Not+to+Breathe+by+Holly+Seddon+%28ePub%2C+Mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"059a0f4fd17c52a66b4ac29fefc5beddf8d5a4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,154,15,79,209,124,82,166,107,74,194,159,239,197,190,221,248,213,164,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
