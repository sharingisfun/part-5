Initially, it was difficult to see Christina outside of the prism of Britney, whose 1999 success launched the new millennium's teen pop boom, but ChristinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s big hits of 1999 - ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGenie in a Bottle,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat a Girl Wants,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome on OverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - more than held their own with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaby One More Time,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while revealing a vocalist with considerably more power and range than her erstwhile rival. Soon, Aguilera distanced herself from the rest of the teen pop pack beginning with her carnal sophomore set, Stripped, a heavy R&amp;B album from 2002 that found its greatest success with the ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeautiful.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Christina may have overemphasized her sexual side with singles like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDirrtty,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but by the time of 2006ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Back to Basics, it was clear that Aguilera was the most musically ambitious, and reliable, pop diva of the boom. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Genie In A Bottle\n02.What A Girl Wants\n03.I Turn To You\n04.So Emotional\n05.Come On Over (All I Want Is You)\n06.Reflection\n07.Love For All Seasons\n08.Somebody's Somebody\n09.When You Put Your Hands On Me\n10.Blessed\n11.Love Will Find A Way\n12.Obvious\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9d4808cf142f829037ceb560b681ad2f33f807","amp;dn":"Christina+Aguilera+-+Christina+Aguilera+1999+++CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9d4808cf142f829037ceb560b681ad2f33f807","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,157,72,8,207,20,47,130,144,55,206,181,96,182,129,173,47,51,248,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
