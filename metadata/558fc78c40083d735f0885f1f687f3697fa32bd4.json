Wasdin, Stephen Templin - SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper\n\nUnabridged; 96 kbps\n\nIn this dramatic, behind-the-scenes chronicle, Howard E. Wasdin takes readers deep inside the world of Navy SEALS and Special Forces snipers, beginning with the grueling selection process of Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S)Ã¢â‚¬â€the toughest and longest military training in the world. After graduating, Wasdin saw combat in Operation Desert Storm as a member of SEAL Team Two. Then the Green Course: the selection process to join the legendary SEAL Team SixÃ¢â‚¬â€a secret unit tasked with counterterrorism, hostage rescue, and counterinsurgency. As a member of Team Six, sniper school followed and Wasdin became one of the best snipers on the planet.\n\nSoon he was fighting for his life. The mission: capture or kill Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. From rooftops, helicopters, and alleys, Wasdin hunted Aidid and killed his men whenever possible. But everything went quickly to hell. The Battle of Mogadishu, as it become known, left eighteen American soldiers dead and seventy-three wounded. WasdinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tale is one of the most thrilling and inspiring military memoirs in years.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nKirkus Reviews\nThough Templin is a co-author, the bulk of this book belongs to Wasdin, a veteran of the infamous &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; incident who reflects on his service and life after the Navy SEALs.\n\nWhile most are aware that the SEALs are America's military elite, few know that &quot;[w]hen the SEALs send their elite, they send SEAL Team Six,&quot; a group tasked with counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Wasdin saw combat with Team Six, following an unusual Navy career and a hardscrabble early life. He stolidly discusses an impoverished Southern childhood of farm work and frequent beatings by his stepfather: &quot;Leon didn't kill me, but anything that was not done exactly right, I paid for.&quot; The author was drawn to the discipline of JROTC in high school; unable to afford college, he signed up for the Navy's Search and Rescue program in the early '80s. After distinguishing himself on risky helicopter-borne operations, he re-enlisted in exchange for a tryout in the notoriously difficult SEALs training program. Wasdin ably portrays this harrowing experience, particularly Hell Week, which was designed to weed out applicants. As a SEAL, Wasdin picked the grueling specialty of sniper; he saw action in Grenada, and received a Navy Commendation Medal in 1991 for covert operations during Desert Storm. The heart of the book is the ill-fated Battle of Mogadishu, where SEAL Team Six first operated a safe house in enemy territory, then became involved in the protracted firefight around two downed helicopters; Wasdin's grave wounds ended his SEAL career. The author demonstrates an impressive attention to detail, vividly recalling the chronology of several violent missions and comfortably discussing the nitty-gritty of the SEALs' uncompromising training and cutting-edge equipment and tactics. The writing is plainspoken and not overly reflectiveÃ¢â‚¬â€the author doesn't consider how his difficult upbringing might have contributed to his warrior's nature. Still, as he describes his exit from military life, Wasdin gives a good sense of how confronting warfare and bloody death has ultimately made him a more contemplative and faithful person.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:558fc78c40083d735f0885f1f687f3697fa32bd4","amp;dn":"Seal+Team+Six+-+Memoirs+Of+An+Elite+Navy+Seal+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"558fc78c40083d735f0885f1f687f3697fa32bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,143,199,140,64,8,61,115,95,8,133,241,246,135,243,105,127,163,43,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
