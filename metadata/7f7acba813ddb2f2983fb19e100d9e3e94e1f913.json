Don't look for the 'wild and crazy guy' you've come to expect.\n\n  LEAP OF FAITH stars Steve Martin as Jonas Nightengale, a fraudulent faith healer who makes a living visiting small towns and giving hope in the form of prayer. Aided by his no nonsense manager, Jane (Debra Winger), Jonas sets up his tent in a small suburb of Kansas where he soon learns that their hidden mikes, cameras and computers can?t fool the neighborhood sheriff (Liam Neeson). But, when Jonas is touched by a local waitress (Lolita Davidovich) and her disabled son Boyd (Lukas Haas), he learns something new about truth and what real miracles are made of.\n\n  Starring: Steve Martin, Debra Winger, Lolita Davidovich, Liam Neeson, Lukas Haas, Meat Loaf.\n\n  Directed by: Richard Pearce.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 48min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f7acba813ddb2f2983fb19e100d9e3e94e1f913","amp;dn":"Leap+of+Faith+%281992%29+%28Steve+Martin%2C+Debra+Winger%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f7acba813ddb2f2983fb19e100d9e3e94e1f913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,122,203,168,19,221,178,242,152,63,177,158,16,13,158,62,148,225,249,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
