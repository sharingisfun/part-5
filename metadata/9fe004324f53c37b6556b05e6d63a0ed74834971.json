Because of this, each edit and subsequent recompression of JPEG photos in general purpose image editors, such as Adobe Photoshop, results in a progressive degradation of image quality.\r\n\r\nFortunately there is, in most cases, a way to avoid this unnecessary recompression. If all you need is to quickly process a group of JPEG photos from your latest vacation - rotate, crop, remove red-eye, correct color and brightness, imprint date or comment - you do not need to compromise on quality of photo editing. Better JPEG is a batch JPEG photo editor that can do all of this editing without loss of image quality.\r\n\r\nGet better result by editing your photos with Better JPEG photo editor:\r\nRotate, Flip photos (lossless)\r\nCrop photos (lossless) - predefined and user-defined aspect ratios and sizes, composition guidelines\r\nAdd Margins to your photos (lossless)\r\nNew Correct Brightness (lossless)\r\nNew Correct Color (lossless)\r\nAdd Date / EXIF Info / Text to photos (lossless) - adjustable position, font, size, color, background, language, format, etc.\r\nRemove Red Eyes from photos (lossless) - anti-aliasing, adjustable size, sensitivity, darkening\r\nCopy/Paste to and from an external editor for local retouching without full recompression (lossless)\r\nResize photos\r\nNew Convert to Black &amp; White (Grayscale) (lossless)\r\nNew Remove JPEG artifacts from photos\r\nE-mail photos to friends and relatives\r\nBatch process photos\r\nCombine actions (Macro)\r\nUndo/Redo editing\r\nPreserve Metadata\r\nOptimize JPEG Compression\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: http://www.betterjpeg.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fe004324f53c37b6556b05e6d63a0ed74834971","amp;dn":"Better+JPEG+v3.0.2.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fe004324f53c37b6556b05e6d63a0ed74834971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,224,4,50,79,83,195,123,101,86,176,94,109,99,160,237,116,131,73,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
