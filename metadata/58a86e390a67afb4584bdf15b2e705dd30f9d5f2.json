He turned up on RCA Records in the mid-'70s singing in a gruff, Joe Cocker-like voice both his own blue-eyed soul songs and cover tunes. Neither record buyers nor critics were much interested by the result. He then became the lead singer in Blackjack, a heavy metal band that made two albums for Polydor at the end of the '70s and the start of the '80s. In 1983, he changed his name to Michael Bolton, signed to Columbia Records as a solo act, and relaunched his career. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.That's What Love Is All About\n02.(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay\n03.Soul Provider\n04.How Am I Supposed To Live Without You\n05.How Can We Be Lovers\n06.When I'm Back On My Feet Again\n07.Georgia On My Mind\n08.Time, Love And Tenderness\n09.When A Man Loves A Woman\n10.Missing You Now\n11.Steel Bars\n12.Said I Loved You...But I Lied\n13.Can I Touch You...There\n14.I Promise You\n15.I Found Someone\n16.A Love So Beautiful\n17.This River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58a86e390a67afb4584bdf15b2e705dd30f9d5f2","amp;dn":"Michael+Bolton+-+Greatest+Hits+1985-1995+%282003%29+mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58a86e390a67afb4584bdf15b2e705dd30f9d5f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,168,110,57,10,103,175,180,88,75,223,21,178,231,5,221,48,249,213,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
