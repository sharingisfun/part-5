Who is the secret member of the Illuminati that many of the members don't know about? And how does Black Bolt, mute monarch of the Inhumans, lie to his teammates? As the cold war between Wakanda and Atlantis heats up into a full-scale conflict, casualties begin to pile up - and an Illuminati member is forced to make a hard choice. But when an Inhuman learns of the Illuminati's plans, everything falls apart. And as Thanos' forces invade Earth, the Illuminati take to the front lines - and the House of Black Bolt cracks!
