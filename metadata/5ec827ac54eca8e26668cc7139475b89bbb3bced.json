Such sequential investment strategies use information collected from the market's past and determine, at the beginning of a trading period, a portfolio; that is, a way to invest the currently available capital among the assets that are available for purchase or investment.\n\nThe aim is to produce a self-contained text intended for a wide audience, including researchers and graduate students in computer science, finance, statistics, mathematics, and engineering.\n\n\nContents:\nOn the History of the Growth-Optimal Portfolio (M M Christensen)\nEmpirical Log-Optimal Portfolio Selections: A Survey (L GyÃƒÂ¶rfi, Gy OttucsÃƒÂ¡k &amp; A UrbÃƒÂ¡n)\nLog-Optimal Portfolio-Selection Strategies with Proportional Transaction Costs (L GyÃƒÂ¶rfi &amp; H Walk)\nGrowth-Optimal Portfolio Selection with Short Selling and Leverage (M HorvÃƒÂ¡th &amp; A UrbÃƒÂ¡n)\nNonparametric Sequential Prediction of Stationary Time Series (L GyÃƒÂ¶rfi &amp; G OttuscÃƒÂ¡k)\nEmpirical Pricing American Put Options (L GyÃƒÂ¶rfi &amp; A Telcs)\n\nReadership: Researchers, academics and graduate students in artificial intelligence/machine learning, and mathematical finance/quantitative finance.
