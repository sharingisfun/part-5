This volume looks at Reconstruction and its aftermath, the impeachment of President Johnson, the rise of capital in America, the corrupt presidency of Grant and the westward shift of Americans to the West. Filled with photos, period illustrations and photos of artifacts it is an excellent resource for understanding post-Civil War America. Includes sidebars on Jefferson Davis, the Grand Review, Lee, the frontier army, Thomas Nast, life for the freedmen after the War and the veterans' reunions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba4ab08fd9aa69d6b95f7a6393f7734a4bd8a81b","amp;dn":"The+Nation+Reunited-Wars+aftermath+%28Time-Life+The+Civil+War%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba4ab08fd9aa69d6b95f7a6393f7734a4bd8a81b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,74,176,143,217,170,105,214,185,95,122,99,147,247,115,74,75,216,168,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
