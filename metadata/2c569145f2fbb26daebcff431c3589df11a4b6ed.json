Along with Buju Banton and Capleton, he helped lead dancehall back to the musical and spiritual influence of roots reggae, favoring organic productions and heavily Rastafarian subject matter. A member of the militant Bobo Ashanti sect, he sometimes courted controversy with his strict adherence to their views, particularly his aggressive condemnations of homosexuals and white Western oppressors. Yet overall, his music was generally positive, advocating faith, compassion for poor black youth, and respect for women. He remained something of an enigma to the public at large, rarely granting interviews and keeping his concert appearances to a minimum. Nonetheless, he still ranked as arguably the most popular conscious reggae artist of his time, thanks to a normally high standard of quality control -- all the more impressive given the frequency with which he recorded. A versatile singjay-style vocalist with a gruff, gravelly tone, he was capable of both rapid-fire chatting and powerful, melodic singing, and his best backing riddims were among the strongest in contemporary dancehall.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nSizzlaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s massive discography has more than its fair share of suspicious releases, most of which drive away new listeners with sub-par material and poor documentation. Crucial Times suffers from the latter in that there are no track by track credits -- although there is an excellent essay -- but the material is top-notch, all of it pulled from the Grove Road vaults of producer Homer Harris and much of it unheard. Given the one-two opening punch of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPrecious GiftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCrucial Time,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the album could easily be mistaken for one of SizzlaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s official releases if it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t for the fact that the sound field changes significantly between the two tracks, signaling that they come from different studios and different time periods. Speaking of time periods, the liner notes claim ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFoundationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is from the first time the singer stepped into the studio, and supports the argument with a picture of a 15 year-old Sizzla on his way to school. Other highlights come from what are obviously later years, as the smooth and modern ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJolly Good TimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ flows like a Third World or Maxi Priest tune, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSufferation and PovertyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ uses a jungle/drum'n'bass beat for a futuristic ragga experience. More info and this collection would be a revelation, but as it is, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a welcome surprise and should have all Sizzla fans wondering what other undiscovered gems this Bobo Dread has lost to the vaults.\n\n01.Precious Gift\n02.Crucial Time\n03.Take A Stand\n04.Agriculture And Education\n05.Charming\n06.Jolly Good Time\n07.Rat Race\n08.There's No Pain\n09.Sufferation And Poverty\n10.Foundation\n11.Atta Clap\n12.Progress\n13.Get Rid Ah Dem\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c569145f2fbb26daebcff431c3589df11a4b6ed","amp;dn":"Sizzla+-+Crucial+Times+%282010%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c569145f2fbb26daebcff431c3589df11a4b6ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,86,145,69,242,251,178,109,174,188,255,67,28,53,137,223,17,164,182,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
