Augustine Tolton [audio presentation]\r\n\r\nBorn a slave in Missouri, Fr. Augustine Tolton became the first African-American priest in the U.S., where he was much loved by the people and showed great priestly zeal. This story of Fr. Toltonâ€™s courage in the face of incredible prejudice within the Church and society will be a source of strength and hope for modern Christians who face persecution for their faith. Also included is an interview with Bishop Joseph Perry, in which he outlines the ongoing cause for the canonization of Fr. Tolton. \r\n\r\nFiletype: MP3\r\n \nhttps://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/from-slave-to-priest\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
