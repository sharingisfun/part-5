Certainly, the singles were the highlights, but they had a handful of first-rate album tracks that made the records necessary for dedicated fans, even if the overall album was inconsistent. Contraband: The Best of Men at Work does a terrific job of consolidating all of their highlights onto one disc. From hits like &quot;Who Can It Be Now?,&quot; &quot;Down Under,&quot; &quot;Overkill,&quot; and &quot;It's a Mistake&quot; to slightly neglected album tracks like &quot;Be Good Johnny,&quot; Contraband has every great track from the Australian new wave band. For most fans, it will be the only disc they need. - Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine  \n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Who Can It Be Now\n[02] Down Under\n[03] ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Mistake\n[04] Hard Luck Story\n[05] Still Life\n[06] Underground\n[07] Upstairs In My House\n[08] I Like To (Live)\n[09] High Wire\n[10] Maria\n[11] Be Good Johnny\n[12] Dr. Heckyll &amp; Jive\n[13] Overkill\n[14] Man With Two Hearts\n[15] Snakes And Ladders\n[16] Down By The Sea\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:03m:57s\nTotal File Size....................... 157mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
