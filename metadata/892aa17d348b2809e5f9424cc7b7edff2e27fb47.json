The title track, &quot;Queen Bee and Her Pals,&quot; &quot;Patti Smith Math Scratch,&quot; and &quot;Ono Soul&quot; are hip, knowing tunes that capture the essence of Moore's songwriting. &quot;Elegy for All the Dead Rock Stars&quot; is a mesmerizing, epic guitar piece that closes the album on a beautiful and poignant note. \n \nTracks :\n\n1.
