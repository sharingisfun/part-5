The releases for The Wall concluded a campaign that also saw Discovery Edition (standard) remasters of all of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums and lavish sets for The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. Though thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no mention of Immersion or Experience anywhere, the Division Bell 20th anniversary box set feature an array of music and swag to make it a fitting companion to the previous Immersion boxes.\nOriginally released in the U.K. by the EMI label and in the U.S. by Columbia Records, The Division Bell was the second Pink Floyd studio albumÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nfollowing the departure from the band of Roger Waters.  Though the musical auteur Waters was not involved, the album was very much in the vein of the classic-era Floyd concept albums.  This time, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason explored the importance of communication.  Gilmour co-produced the album with Bob Ezrin (The Wall, Alice Cooper, KISS) and had a hand in writing all but one track.  Wright co-wrote a number of the tracks with Gilmour, and one with Anthony Moore, and also provided his first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since The Dark Side of the Moon.  Other lyrics were provided by GilmourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife Polly Samson and Nick Laird-Clowes; Ezrin co-wrote music for one song.  Michael Kamen contributed orchestral arrangements to the album.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cc1dbf85fc9b4af08a409ddcb918bc78936521c","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Division+Bell+%5B20th+Anniversary+Double+Vinyl+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cc1dbf85fc9b4af08a409ddcb918bc78936521c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,193,219,248,95,201,180,175,8,164,9,221,203,145,139,199,137,54,82,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
