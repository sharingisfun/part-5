Sick of being the only virgin among her friends, she decides the best way to deal with the problem is to lose it as quickly and simply as possible-- a one-night stand. But her plan turns out to be anything but simple when she freaks out and leaves a gorgeous guy alone and naked in her bed with an excuse that no one with half-a-brain would ever believe. And as if that weren't embarrassing enough, when she arrives for her first class of her last college semester, she recognizes her new theatre professor. She'd left him naked in her bed about 8 hours earlier.\n\nFaking It (Losing It #2) by Cora Carmack (June 4th 2013)\n\nMackenzie Ã¢â‚¬Å“MaxÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Miller has a problem. Her parents have arrived in town for a surprise visit, and if they see her dyed hair, tattoos, and piercings, they just might disown her. Even worse, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re expecting to meet a nice, wholesome boyfriend, not a guy named Mace who has a neck tattoo and plays in a band. All her lies are about to come crashing down around her, but then she meets Cade.\n\nCade moved to Philadelphia to act and to leave his problems behind in Texas. So far though, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kept the problems and had very little opportunity to take the stage. When Max approaches him in a coffee shop with a crazy request to pretend to be her boyfriend, he agrees to play the part. But when Cade plays the role a little too well, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re forced to keep the ruse going. And the more they fake the relationship, the more real it begins to feel.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e3c3cce586ce76e6cc7d572266dcbb1973d0894","amp;dn":"Losing+It+Series+%281-2%29+by+Cora+Carmack+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e3c3cce586ce76e6cc7d572266dcbb1973d0894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,60,60,206,88,108,231,110,108,199,213,114,38,109,203,177,151,61,8,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
