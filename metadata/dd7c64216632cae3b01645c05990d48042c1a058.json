The album is notable for being unlike any previous live release by the band in that it features a mix of intimate club recordings and live-in-the-studio reinterpretations of some classic and obscure recordings from their extensive catalogue.\n\nThe in-studio sessions were recorded in two parts: from 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“5 March 1995 in Tokyo, Japan and 23ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“26 July in Lisbon, Portugal while the live club dates are spread out from performances in London, Paris and Amsterdam.\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\nUNPLUGGED:[Bootleg]\n\nQuote from cover: This is a collection of studio outtakes from 1968 - 1973. Alternate versions and rough mixes of released songs, as well as unknown tracks (3, 6, 10). Together they make up for a superb &quot;Unplugged&quot; CD (with the occasional electric guitar here and there) recorded long before the days of MTV. \n[it's a great selection, not least because of the fabulous acoustic version of All Down The Line, which bears little resemblance to the standard version]\n\n   1.  3:28    Dear Doctor    \n   2.  2:50    You Got The Silver    \n   3.  4:11    Family    \n   4.  2:50    No Expectations    \n   5.  5:36    Sister Morphine    \n   6.  5:18    Blood Red Wine    \n   7.  3:04    Country Honk    \n   8.  6:42    You Can't Always Get What You Want    \n   9.  2:35    You Gotta Move    \n   10. 5:31    Wild Horses    \n   11. 4:20    All Down The Line    \n   12. 3:30    Cocksucker Blues    \n   13. 4:07    Dead Flowers    \n   14. 4:33    Angie\n\n    \n   Total   58:35","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd7c64216632cae3b01645c05990d48042c1a058","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones---2+Cds---Stripped---Unplugged+%5Bbootleg%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd7c64216632cae3b01645c05990d48042c1a058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,124,100,33,102,50,202,227,176,22,69,192,89,144,212,128,66,193,160,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
