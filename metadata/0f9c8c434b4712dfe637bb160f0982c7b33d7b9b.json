King, is an American soul singer. From the groundbreaking orchestrated productions of the Drifters to his own solo hits, Ben E. King was the definition of R&amp;B elegance. King's plaintive baritone had all the passion of gospel, but the settings in which it was displayed were tailored more for his honey smooth phrasing and crisp enunciation, proving for perhaps the first time that R&amp;B could be sophisticated and accessible to straight pop audiences. King's approach influenced countless smooth soul singers in his wake and his records were key forerunners of the Motown sound. (allmusic.com)\n\n- - -\n\nBen E.
