The nimble-minded nonfiction writer who dazzled us in Emergence, Mind Wide Open, and Everything Bad Is Good for You now parses a storied incident from the annals of public health-- the Broad Street cholera epidemic of 1854, a deadly outbreak that literally decimated London's population in eight days. \n\nAt the center of the story stand two heroic figures: Reverend Henry Whitehead and Dr. John Snow, whose combined efforts in mapping the disease solved the mystery of how cholera spreads and created a model of information design with wide-ranging implications. Using historical narrative as a scaffolding for some of his famously big ideas, Johnson shows how this story from Victorian times offers lessons for modern cities facing a host of problems-- from urban sprawl to environmental crises and the threat of bio-terrorism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10bb7ffe2c72eeddfcc93581d328c2fb0f3b6acd","amp;dn":"The+Ghost+Map%3Aworking+by+Steven+Johnson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10bb7ffe2c72eeddfcc93581d328c2fb0f3b6acd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,187,127,254,44,114,238,221,252,201,53,129,211,40,194,251,15,59,106,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
