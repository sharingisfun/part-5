Venkata Rao (Springer, 2011).pdf\n\nISBN 9780857290144\n\nAdvanced Modeling and Optimization of Manufacturing Processes presents a comprehensive review of the latest international research and development trends in the modeling and optimization of manufacturing processes, with a focus on machining. It uses examples of various manufacturing processes to demonstrate advanced modeling and optimization techniques. Both basic and advanced concepts are presented for various manufacturing processes, mathematical models, traditional and non-traditional optimization techniques, and real case studies. The results of the application of the proposed methods are also covered and the book highlights the most useful modeling and optimization strategies for achieving best process performance. In addition to covering the advanced modeling, optimization and environmental aspects of machining processes, Advanced Modeling and Optimization of Manufacturing Processes also covers the latest technological advances, including rapid prototyping and tooling, micromachining, and nano-finishing. Advanced Modeling and Optimization of Manufacturing Processes is written for designers and manufacturing engineers who are responsible for the technical aspects of product realization, as it presents new models and optimization techniques to make their work easier, more efficient, and more effective. It is also a useful text for practitioners, researchers, and advanced students in mechanical, industrial, and manufacturing engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18fed82d6e76076c4613662071dc2cf5e036b6f9","amp;dn":"Advanced+Modeling+and+Optimization+of+Manufacturing+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18fed82d6e76076c4613662071dc2cf5e036b6f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,254,216,45,110,118,7,108,70,19,102,32,113,220,44,245,224,54,182,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
