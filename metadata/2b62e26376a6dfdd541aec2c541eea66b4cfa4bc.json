Cyndi Lauper had huge success for a comparatively short period. After one unsuccessful album, Cyndi recorded three albums in the eighties (She's so unusual, True colors, A night to remember) that gave her plenty of success and it is from these three albums that this compilation is mainly assembled.\nThis compilation includes all of Cyndi's important hits of the eighties including Girls just want to have fun, Time after time (later covered by Eva Cassady among others), She bop, All through the night, True colors, Change of heart (with the Bangles on backing vocals), What's going on (a cover of a Marvin Gaye classic) and I drove all night (which also became a top ten UK hit for Roy Orbison).  If you just want one collection of Cyndi's music, this has all the essential eighties tracks.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Girls Just Want To Have Fun\n[02] She Bop\n[03] I Drove All Night\n[04] What's Going On\n[05] Time After Time\n[06] True Colors\n[07] All Through The Night\n[08] The World Is Stone\n[09] I Don't Want To Be Your Friend\n[10] The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\n[11] Maybe He'll Know\n[12] When You Were Mine\n[13] Iko Iko\n[14] Change Of Heart\n[15] Hey Now (Girls Just Want To Have Fun)\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:00m:36s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 397mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
