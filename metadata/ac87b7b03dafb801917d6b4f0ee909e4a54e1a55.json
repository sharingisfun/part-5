Maloin had reached a point in life where he was content to embrace loneliness while turning a blind eye to the inevitable decay that surrounded him. Upon bearing witness to a shocking murder, however, the man who once lived a life of quiet solitude is forced to wrestle with such profound issues as punishment, mortality, and the sin of complicity in a crime he didn't even commit. Now, despite Maloin's simple wish to be free and happy, he must journey deep within his inner-self to confront emotions that he never once fathomed in his long yet uneventful existence.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Bela.Tarr.2007.A.Londoni.Ferfi.DVDRip.XViD-KG.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,041,352,192 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 02:13:26\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x384 (AR: 1.667)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1809 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.294 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000(AC3, Dolby Laboratories, Inc) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 224 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nenglish and french audio, english and portuguese subtitles\n\nNot my rip.
