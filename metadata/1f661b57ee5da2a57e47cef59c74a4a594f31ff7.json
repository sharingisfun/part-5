They all have their own problems, such as finance, harrassment, personal safety, and self doubt. Additionally, campus life seems to be causing a problem for everyone: racism. Students, already under pressure to perform in the classroom, on the track, or in front of their friends, are strained to the breaking point by prejudice, inexperience, and misunderstanding. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113305/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f661b57ee5da2a57e47cef59c74a4a594f31ff7","amp;dn":"Higher+Learning-DvdRip-1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f661b57ee5da2a57e47cef59c74a4a594f31ff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,102,27,87,238,93,162,165,126,71,206,245,156,116,164,165,148,243,31,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
