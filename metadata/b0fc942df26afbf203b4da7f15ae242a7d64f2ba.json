Vault had 15 songs. Rock of Ages has 35, including all of the songs on Vault. Actually, the first disc of Rock of Ages functions as an expanded version of that earlier comp, adding two cuts. The second disc skips around their career, wisely concentrating on their early-'80s albums, which were somewhat under-represented on Vault, and adding a new song for good measure (a cover of Badfinger's &quot;No Matter What,&quot; which is from their &quot;forthcoming covers album&quot;). While this may be too much Def Leppard for some casual fans -- for those listeners, the 2004 import-only collection Best of Def Leppard is a good choice, since it expands on Vault -- it nevertheless is the best overview of the group's career yet\nassembled, since it has not only the hits, but the sleek, glammy pop-metal that earned them the reputation as one of the biggest and best bands of the '80s.\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD 1\n1. &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me (Historia Video Edit)&quot; 4:52\n2. &quot;Photograph&quot; 4:08\n3. &quot;Love Bites&quot; 5:47\n4. &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot; 4:56\n5. &quot;Two Steps Behind (Acoustic Version)&quot; 4:19\n6. &quot;Animal&quot; 4:03\n7. &quot;Heaven Is&quot; 3:34\n8. &quot;Foolin'&quot; 4:34\n9. &quot;Rocket (Visualize Video Edit)&quot; 4:07\n10. &quot;When Love &amp; Hate Collide&quot; 4:17\n11. &quot;Armageddon It&quot; 5:22\n12. &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot; 5:19\n13. &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; 4:08\n14. &quot;Hysteria&quot; 5:56\n15. &quot;Miss You in a Heartbeat&quot; 4:04\n16. &quot;Bringin' on the Heartbreak&quot; 4:33\n17. &quot;Switch 625&quot;\n\nCD 2\n1. &quot;Rock!
