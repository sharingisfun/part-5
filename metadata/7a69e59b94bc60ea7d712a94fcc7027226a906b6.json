She was a three-masted corvette with auxiliary steam, and as well as a crew of 243 she carried a team of scientists led by Professor Wyville Thomson.\r\nThe voyage of the Challenger was a pioneer expedition of immense importance. It was sponsored by the British Government and organized by the Royal Society in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, where the science of Oceanography was born. The ambitious aim of the voyage was to chart the depths, movement and content of the seas, to scour the oceans for marine life, for clues to climatic phenomena, and for minerals.\r\nThe naturalists on board - Henry Moseley and John Murray - were observant recorders of life ashore as well as at sea, and the narratives and drawings of the naval officers, Lord George Campbell, Herbert Swire and Richard Channer, provide a sharp picture of three-and-a-half years afloat.\r\nImagine an Australia in which Melbourne could stage an elegant nine-course dinner for Challenger's officers, while at Cape York aborigines lived in such a primitive state of culture that their only shelter, writes Moseley, was a palm leaf. In New Guinea the expedition encountered the opposition of savage cannibal tribes; in a newly awakened Japan they found all the delights of that amazing land; in Hawaii there was a climb into the active crater of Kilauea; in Tierra del Fuego a glimpse of a race soon to become extinct.\r\nEric Linklater has distilled from such events as these a continuous and compelling narrative for the general reader, a book of adventure as well as discovery. He uses the personal journals to give an individual edge to the scientific triumph, and to convey a masterly immediacy to his readers. In 1872 the camera was a recent invention. A darkroom\r\nwas installed on board the ship, and photographic plates were coated and exposed to bring back a unique record of the voyage. This new narrative is illustrated with photographs made from the original plates, and from the scientists' albums there are many other illustrations which have never before been published.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nList of colour plates 6\r\nAcknowledgments 9\r\n1 Edinburgh and the Navy 1\r\n2 Ship's Company 15\r\n3 Atlantic isles, Atlantic depths 23\r\n4 Noddies, Boobies, and Brazil 39\r\n5 The Penguins of Tristan da Cunha 49\r\n6 Shore-leave at Cape Town 59\r\n7 In the Roaring Forties 65\r\n8 Elephant Seals and Kerguelen Cabbage 73\r\n9 An archipelago of glittering ice 85\r\n10 A starfish and a storm 91\r\n11 From Tonga to Fiji 105\r\n12 The people of Cape York 1\r\n13 For sale: Birds of Paradise 131\r\n14 Mindanao and Zamboanga 155\r\n15 New Guinea and the wood-carvers 167\r\n16 The pleasures ofJapan 193\r\n17 Honolulu and the goddess Pele 213\r\n18 Thirty days to Tahiti 231\r\n19 The castaways ofJuan Fernandez 243\r\n20 The firths of Patagonia 255\r\n21 From the Falklands to Spithead 265\r\nPostscript: Achievements of the voyage 273\r\nBibliography 281\r\nList and sources of monochrome illustrations 282\r\nIndex 285\r\n \nhttps://s31.postimg.org/6271l7cln/The_Voyage_of_the_Challenger.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a69e59b94bc60ea7d712a94fcc7027226a906b6","amp;dn":"The+Voyage+of+the+Challenger+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a69e59b94bc60ea7d712a94fcc7027226a906b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,105,229,155,148,188,96,234,125,113,42,148,252,199,2,114,38,169,6,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
