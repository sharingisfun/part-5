The EP is currently streaming in its entirety on RoadrunnerRecords.com and you can stream and download the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fat Around The HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ now at KING810.com. proem is available on iTunes on 5/13. This collection preludes the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full-length debut slated for later this summer.\n\nFlint, MI, the forgotten city, is where KING 810 call home and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the dystopian dwelling that sets the back drop for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest effort, proem. With no mayor to preside over the bereft community and a minuscule police force, Flint, MI teaches its young to fend for themselves. proem is an embodiment of KING 810Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s life within this pressure cooker, a glimpse into the personal account of this disappearing metropolis where tree branches live longer than the children do.\n\nproem traces the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Midwest survival, stirred by frontman David GunnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s examination of his own existence and the dying kingdom around him. The band is set to debut new material at Columbus, OHÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rock On The Range on May 17th followed by a performance at the Download Festival in the UK on June 15th. KING 810 will then traverse the US on the Rockstar Mayhem Festival and release their Roadrunner Records debut album this August.\n\nlineup:\n\nDavid Gunn\n: Vocals\nTwerk\n: Drums\nKarl\n: Guitar\nEugene\n: Bass\n\nhomepage:\n.king810.com\nGenre: Hardcore\nBitrate: Vbr\nSize: 60.21 MB\nFile Name Size\nKING 810 midwest monsters/King810-MidwestMonstersEP-07-DraggingKnives.mp3 7.89 MB\nKing 810 - Proem EP - 2014 - 192kbps/04 Desperate Lovers.mp3 5.92 MB\nKING 810 midwest monsters/King810-MidwestMonstersEP-05-Wolves.mp3 5.72 MB\nKING 810 midwest monsters/King810-MidwestMonstersEP-04-Magician.mp3 5.43 MB\nKING 810 midwest monsters/King810-MidwestMonstersEP-06-Kia.mp3 5.26 MB\nKING 810 midwest monsters/King810-MidwestMonstersEP-03-MurderMurderMurder.mp3 5.22 MB\nKing 810 - Proem EP - 2014 - 192kbps/03 Fat Around The Heart.mp3 5.20 MB\nKING 810 midwest monsters/King810-MidwestMonstersEP-02-TheDeathPosture.mp3 5.06 MB\nKing 810 - Proem EP - 2014 - 192kbps/02 Killem All.mp3 4.73 MB\nKING 810 midwest monsters/King810-MidwestMonstersEP-01-MidwestMonsters.mp3 4.39 MB\nKing 810 - Proem EP - 2014 - 192kbps/05 anatomy 1_1.mp3 3.37 MB\nKing 810 - Proem EP - 2014 - 192kbps/01 810.mp3 1.94 MB\nKing 810 - Proem EP - 2014 - 192kbps/Cover.jpg 91.07 KB This needs to be seeded so others can enjoy.......And  See King 810 Slipknot and KoRn this winter they will be touring together","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7767b392bcdfc83b37b9a2aec83f3f112e1d554b","amp;dn":"King+810+-+Mid+West+Monsters+2012+and+proem%28EPs%29++VBR++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7767b392bcdfc83b37b9a2aec83f3f112e1d554b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,103,179,146,188,223,200,59,55,185,162,174,200,63,63,17,46,29,85,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
