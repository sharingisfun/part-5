The limits of entrapment,\n\ninnocence and guilt, and madness and sanity fade as the story develops and the reader is faced with a Guy who isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t \n\ncompletely innocent and a Bruno that can be seen as a victim.\n\nThe awakening of GuyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s destructive desires suggests that conflict between conscious behavior and subconscious  desire may trigger the criminal potential in anyone, and\n\nresult in immoral action, the doubling of personality and the consequent ethical and psychological degradation.\n\nGuilt and complicity: Patricia Highsmith once commented that she is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinterested in the effect of guiltÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on her heroes. This novel is a study of guilt, and the kind\n\nof pressures that destroy a manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soul. The exploration of guilt also provokes a reflection on the definition and limits of complicity.\n\n\nLinks:\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/54392603/Strangers-on-a-train-Notes-by-Patricia-Highsmith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/54392603/Strangers-on-a-train-Notes-by-Patricia-Highsmith&lt;/a&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nGuys, Do Post Your feedback on it.And, Thanxx By The Way.\n\n\nSEEDING IS MUST , HERE TOO.....\n\n\n (;............................................ __Abee ............................. ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ed7080a3b9b1195f9ae853f4a15982962801bac","amp;dn":"Strangers+on+a+train+%3A+By+Patricia+Highsmith+%28+Best+Crime+Novel+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ed7080a3b9b1195f9ae853f4a15982962801bac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,215,8,10,59,155,17,149,249,174,133,63,74,21,152,41,98,128,27,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
