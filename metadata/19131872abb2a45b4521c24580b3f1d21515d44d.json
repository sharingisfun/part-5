Weiss (Author) \n\nMobi , Epub , Pdf\n\n-------------------\n\nBook Description :\n\nAs a traditional psychotherapist, Dr. Brian Weiss was astonished and skeptical when one of his patients began recalling past-life traumas that seemed to\n\nhold the key to her recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks. His skepticism was eroded, however, when she began to channel messages from the &quot;space between lives,&quot; which contained remarkable revelations about Dr. Weiss' family and his dead son. Using past-life therapy, he was able to cure the patient and embark on a new, more meaningful phase of his own career.\n\n-------------------\n\ncreated by Yasser Adnan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19131872abb2a45b4521c24580b3f1d21515d44d","amp;dn":"Many+Lives+Many+Masters+%2C+by+Brian+Weiss+%2C+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19131872abb2a45b4521c24580b3f1d21515d44d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,19,24,114,171,178,164,91,69,33,194,69,128,179,241,210,21,21,212,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
