The Scorsese film also includes archive footage from the band's career and marked the first utilisation by Scorsese of digital cinematography for his films with it being used for the backstage sequences. The film takes its title from the song of the same name, featured on the band's 1972 album Exile on Main St. A soundtrack album was released in April 2008 on the Universal label. The Rolling Stones' Beacon Theater performances benefitted the Clinton Foundation, a charity founded by Bill Clinton, who gave a short speech at the October 29 performance. The film also shows Jack White, Buddy Guy and Christina Aguilera performing with the Stones.\n\nDirected by\t:Martin Scorsese\nProduced by\t:Steve Bing,Michael Cohl\nStarring\t:Mick Jagger.Keith Richards,Charlie Watts,Ronnie Wood\n                :Christina Aguilera,Buddy Guy,Jack White\nMusic by\t:The Rolling Stones\nDistributed by\t:Paramount Vantage (USA),20th Century Fox (UK)\nRelease date(s)\t:April 4, 2008\nRunning time\t:122 min\n\nMost of the performance footage was culled from the second night of filming.
