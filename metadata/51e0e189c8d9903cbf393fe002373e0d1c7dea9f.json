We follow the story of Hip Flask and Ebony Hide (Hippopotamus and Elephant crosses respectively) as they try to get by in a world in which they are shunned and treated with suspicion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51e0e189c8d9903cbf393fe002373e0d1c7dea9f","amp;dn":"Elephantmen+%28001+-+058%29+%282006+-+Ongoing%29+%28Digital%29+%28Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51e0e189c8d9903cbf393fe002373e0d1c7dea9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,224,225,137,200,217,144,60,191,57,63,224,2,55,62,13,28,125,234,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
