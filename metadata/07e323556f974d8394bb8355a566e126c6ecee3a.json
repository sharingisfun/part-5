On the perfect night. About to become trapped in the perfect crime. Will Jennings is a successful young doctor in Jackson, Mississippi, with a thriving practice, a beautiful wife, and a five-year-old daughter he loves beyond measure. But Will and his family are being watched by a con man and psychopath who may be a genius. A man who has crafted the unbeatable crime. A man who has never been caught and whose victims have never talked to the police. A man whose life's work strikes at the heart of every family's unspoken fear: the unstoppable kidnapping.\n\nBut this man has never met the likes of Will and Karen Jennings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07e323556f974d8394bb8355a566e126c6ecee3a","amp;dn":"Greg+Iles+-+24+Hours+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07e323556f974d8394bb8355a566e126c6ecee3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,227,35,85,111,151,77,131,148,187,131,85,165,102,225,38,198,236,238,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
