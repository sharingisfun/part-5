Shankar, &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics, 2nd Edition&quot;\n\n2011 | ISBN-10: 0306447908 | 676 pages | EPUB | 31 MB\n\nR. Shankar has introduced major additions and updated key presentations in this second edition of Principles of Quantum Mechanics. New features of this innovative text include an entirely rewritten mathematical introduction, a discussion of Time-reversal invariance, and extensive coverage of a variety of path integrals and their applications. Additional highlights include:\n- Clear, accessible treatment of underlying mathematics\n- A review of Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics\n- Student understanding of quantum theory is enhanced by separate treatment of mathematical theorems and physical postulates\n- Unsurpassed coverage of path integrals and their relevance in contemporary physics\nThe requisite text for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level students, Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition is fully referenced and is supported by many exercises and solutions. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-contained chapters also make it suitable for independent study as well as for courses in applied disciplines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ad31243643b8718c10bfd3ca3e6b49d83bd5ec5","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Quantum+Mechanics%2C+2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ad31243643b8718c10bfd3ca3e6b49d83bd5ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,211,18,67,100,59,135,24,193,11,253,60,163,230,180,157,131,189,94,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
