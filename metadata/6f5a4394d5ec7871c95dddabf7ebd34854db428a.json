It also, far from being Ã¢â‚¬Å“ambientÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the true sense, has both feet on the dancefloor, extraordinarily heavy bass throughout, and a surprising understanding of black American music. For all its mindmelt and harmonic sophistication, it grooves like a mother. Like the greatest electronic dance music, it hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dated at all.\n\nOn Ã¢â‚¬Å“Selected Ambient Works Volume 2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1994) Aphex Twin updated Brian Eno's mid-Seventies concept of &quot;discreet,&quot; or ambient, music for the sunrise comedown hours after a hard night's rave. Richard D. James created an enriched, wraparound style of burp-and-whoosh programming, the perfect soundtrack for pulling the pieces of your brain back together after spilling them all over the club floor. The first dance album to celebrate the rhythms in your head.\n\n\n\nAphex Twin\n\n1. Selected Ambient Works 85-92 (1992)\n\n2.
