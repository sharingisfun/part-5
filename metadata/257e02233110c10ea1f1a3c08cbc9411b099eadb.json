Sydney is haunted by the loss of her father and twin sister in a car accident many years ago. Socially ill-at-ease, Sydney spends her days as a telephone lineswoman for Tel-Cal and her nights as a hacker on a &quot;home-brew&quot; computer system she assembled herself. \nOne night, Sydney inadvertently taps into an open phone line and connects it to her computer modem, bringing the person on the other end into her computer world beyond what we know as virtual reality, what she comes to call VR.5.
