A lonely railroad track. A crime scene. A coverup.\n\nA young woman is dead, and solid evidence points to a soldier at a nearby military base. But that soldier has powerful friends in Washington.\n\nReacher is ordered undercoverÃ¢â‚¬â€to find out everything he can, to control the local police, and then to vanish. Reacher is a good soldier. But when he gets to Carter Crossing, he finds layers no one saw coming, and the investigation spins out of control.\n\nLocal sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux has a thirst for justiceÃ¢â‚¬â€and an appetite for secrets. Uncertain they can trust one another, Reacher and Deveraux reluctantly join forces. Reacher works to uncover the truth, while others try to bury it forever. The conspiracy threatens to shatter his faith in his mission, and turn him into a man to be feared.\n\nFor Reacher fans, this flashback novel on Reacher's last days in the Army is historically interesting because it fills gaps in his resume. It provides a different reason for why he left the Army than given in earlier novels. It also shows how Reacher's &quot;no suitcase, will travel&quot; ethos got started.\n\nEPUB,MOBI AND TXT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42b48841367524392a0658b2a4fb9044414456e","amp;dn":"The+Affair+By+Lee+Child","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42b48841367524392a0658b2a4fb9044414456e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,43,72,132,19,103,82,67,146,160,101,139,42,79,185,4,68,20,69,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
