With this bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensively revised second edition, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll focus on Android tools and programming essentials, including best practices for using Android 4 APIs. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re experienced with Java or Objective-C, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll gain the knowledge necessary for building well-engineered applications.\n\nProgramming Android is organized into four parts:\n\n- Part One helps programmers with some Java or iOS experience get off to a fast start with the Android SDK and Android programming basics.\n- Part Two delves into the Android framework, focusing on user interface and graphics class hierarchies, concurrency, and databases. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a solid foundation for understanding of how the most important parts of an Android application work.\n- Part Three features code skeletons and patterns for accelerating the development of apps that use web data and Android 4 user interface conventions and APIs.\n- Part Four delivers practical coverage of AndroidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multimedia, search, location, sensor, and account APIs, plus the Native Development Kit, enabling developers to add advanced capabilities.\n\nThis updated edition of Programming Android focuses on the knowledge and developer priorities that are essential for successful Android development projects.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: Tools and Basics\nChapter 1.
