Only three-apples high, The Smurfs live in mushroom houses, eat sarsaparilla and cake, and speak their very own Smurfy language. But life in the village isn't always fun and fancy-free, not with the villainous sorcerer Gargamel and his snarling cat Azrael nearby! Papercutz is proud to present the complete collection of classic Smurf-tastic adventures from world-renowned cartoonist Peyo in this graphic novel series. These charming stories are some of the Smurfiest comics ever made!\n\nThanks goes to Bean for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
