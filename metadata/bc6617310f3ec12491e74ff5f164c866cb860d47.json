She is notable for performing with Lionel Loueke, Wayne Shorter and Kenny Barron, and being praised by Herbie Hancock; who said Gretchen has &quot;a deep, almost magical connection to the music. She takes a lot of chances with her understated style, and it works. Every note is expressive, powerful, and pretty. And most important, her heart is in the right place.&quot; Wayne Shorter adds, &quot;In an inconspicuous way, Gretchen knows how to play the same instrument that Frank Sinatra played. There is no one out there like Gretchen.&quot;\n\nIn 2001 she was the first vocalist to be accepted into the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Performance by a panel of judges including jazz legends Herbie Hancock, Terence Blanchard and Wayne Shorter.\n\nIn 2004 she won the first place in the prestigious Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocals Competition at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. Judges included Quincy Jones, Flora Purim, Jimmy Scott, Al Jarreau, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Kurt Elling.\n\nIn 2005 she released her first self titled album. It was named #5 Best Progressive Jazz CDs of 2005 by Jazz Nation and got 5 stars in Down Beat's Blindfold Test by Richard Bona in July 2007.\n\nIn August 2007 she was named #3 Rising Star Female Vocalist in DownBeat's 55th Annual Critics Poll.\n\nIn September 2007 she performed with jazz legend Wayne Shorter at La Villette Jazz Festival in Paris.\n\nIn June 2008, a live recording of Gretchen performing in New York was aired by Japanese NHK network television.\n\nIn July 2008, Parlato signed a recording contract with independent record label ObliqSound. The same week, she was also named #4 Rising Star Female Vocalist in Downbeat's 56th Annual Critics Poll, tied with Lizz Wright, who also appears on Massimo Biolcati's album Persona, as a vocal guest, just like Parlato.\n\nIn August 2009 she released her second cd, &quot;In a Dream&quot; on the ObliqSound record label, with Lionel Loueke on guitar and vocals, Aaron Parks on piano and Fender Rhodes, Derrick Hodge on acoustic and electric bass and Kendrick Scott on drums.
