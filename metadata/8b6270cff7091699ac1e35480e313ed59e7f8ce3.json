Rather, it was pervasive and systematic, the predictable consequence of orders to &quot;kill anything that moves.&quot;\n\nDrawing on more than a decade of research in secret Pentagon files and extensive interviews with American veterans and Vietnamese survivors, Turse reveals for the first time how official policies resulted in millions of innocent civilians killed and wounded. In shocking detail, he lays out the workings of a military machine that made crimes in almost every major American combat unit all but inevitable. Kill Anything That Moves takes us from archives filled with Washington's long-suppressed war crime investigations to the rural Vietnamese hamlets that bore the brunt of the war; from boot camps where young American soldiers learned to hate all Vietnamese to bloodthirsty campaigns like Operation Speedy Express, in which a general obsessed with body counts led soldiers to commit what one participant called &quot;a My Lai a month.&quot;\n\nThousands of Vietnam books later, Kill Anything That Moves, devastating and definitive, finally brings us faceÃ¢â‚¬â€˜toÃ¢â‚¬â€˜face with the truth of a war that haunts Americans to this day.\n\n\n\nFrom Bookforum\n\n\nAfter reading Turse's meticulous, extraordinary, and oddly moving account, it's hard to avoid concluding that the US record in Vietnam has more in common with the Wehrmacht and the Imperial Japanese Army than &quot;the greatest generation&quot; that fought those enemies in World War II. \n\n\nReview\n\nHarrowing.\n\n--The New York Review of Books\n\nAn indispensable new history of the war ... Kill Anything That Moves is a paradigm-shifting, connect-the-dots history of American atrocities that reads like a thriller; it will convince those with the stomach to read it that all these decades later Americans, certainly the military brass and the White House, still haven't drawn the right lesson from Vietnam.\n\n--San Francisco Chronicle\n\nA powerful caseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ With his urgent but highly readable style, Turse delves into the secret history of U.S.-led atrocities. He has brought to his book an impressive trove of new research - archives explored and eyewitnesses interviewed in the United States and Vietnam. With superb narrative skill, he spotlights a troubling question: Why, with all the evidence collected by the military at the time of the war, were atrocities not prosecuted?\n\n--Washington Post\n\nThere have been many memorable accounts of the terrible things done in Vietnam - memoirs, histories, documentaries and movies. But Nick Turse has given us a fresh holistic work that stands alone for its blending of history and journalism, for the integrity of research brought to life through the diligence of first-person interviews... Here is a powerful message for us today - a reminder of what war really costs.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Bill Moyers, Moyers &amp; Company\n\nIn Kill Anything that Moves, Nick Turse has for the first time put together a comprehensive picture, written with mastery and dignity, of what American forces actually were doing in Vietnam. The findings disclose an almost unspeakable truth ... Like a tightening net, the web of stories and reports drawn from myriad sources coalesces into a convincing, inescapable portrait of this war - a portrait that, as an American, you do not wish to see; that, having seen, you wish you could forget, but that you should not forget.\n\n--Jonathan Schell, The Nation\n\nA masterpieceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Kill Anything That Moves is not only one of the most important books ever written about the Vietnam conflict but provides readers with an unflinching account of the nature of modern industrial warfare ... Turse, finally, grasps that the trauma that plagues most combat veterans is a result not only of what they witnessed or endured, but what they did.\n\n--Chris Hedges, Truthdig\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b6270cff7091699ac1e35480e313ed59e7f8ce3","amp;dn":"NIck+Turse+-+Kill+Anything+That+Moves+-+The+War+in+Vietnam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b6270cff7091699ac1e35480e313ed59e7f8ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,98,112,207,247,9,22,153,172,30,53,72,14,49,62,213,158,127,140,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
