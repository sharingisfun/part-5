Although makes it a bit more difficult to start with such a Reference because often lose &quot;Big Picture&quot; saves buying simpler introductions that can usually be found on internet. \n\nExcellent condition. Quick service.\n\n\n\nSummary: Great Reference, but way to general and out of date\nRating: 2\n\nTHis was one of the more expensive books I bought for info on the ARM architectures, but I'm disappointed, the book covers just the core ARM architecture and is a few years out of date now too. Its a tough book to write, no doubt, there are so many variations on ARM that its unrealistic to expect them all to be coevered, but I'd like to have seen some more specifics. Most ARM imlementations by the multiple vendors ot there put in a bunch of peripherals, I'd like to have seen some attemtp to address those features better. \n\nIf you wanted a detailed ARM core reference, it might be the book for you, but bear in mind it doesn;t addres the newer products...\n\n\n\nSummary: Arm archticture reference manual 2nd edition\nRating: 5\n\nI you plan , or are already developing for arm , than this book is a must have on the bookshelf !\n\n\n\nSummary: Clear, competent, well organized.\nRating: 4\n\nThis is a completely adequate reference for the basic ARM architecture, including the Thumb instruction set. \n\nThis is a reference book, not an instruction manual - you'll probably be happiest with this book if you already know at least one or two other assembly languages. Given that background, you might like the ARM ISP. It's a very regular RISC. The Thumb subset is even more stripped-down, but lets you pack parts of you code almost twice as densely as usual. \n\nIf you've gotten this far, you already know that there are dozens of ARM implementations, with different add-ons and special features. This, of course, can't handle your special circumstance. Still, it's my favortie presentation of the core ARM instruction set.
