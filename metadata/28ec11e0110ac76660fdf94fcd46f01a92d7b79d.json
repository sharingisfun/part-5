Those works, and especially the first two, are of blazing beauty and show a true romantic mind, bordering on lunacy.\r\nGeza Anda is a Hungarian virtuoso who specialized in XIXth century piano music. His style is sharp and fast, very vivid.\r\nThe sound quality is impressive for a live recording, maybe a bit flat but very clean (you will be surprised when you'll hear the public clapping at the end!)\r\n\r\n* Technicals \r\nTotal duration - 1h 15m 28s\r\nAverage bitrate - 198 kbps\r\nEncoder - FLAC 1.3.1, lossless, compression level 5\r\n\r\n\r\n* Tracks\r\n \nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/release/schumann-kreisleriana-symphonische-et%C3%BCden-carnaval-mr0002736315\r\n\r\n\r\n01-13 - Symphonic Studies, op. 13\r\n14-21 - Kreisleriana, op. 16\r\n22-29 - Carnaval, op. 9\r\n\r\n///.....................................................\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Caudheur's Classical Catalog (CCC)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a pretty decent collection of classical music, encoded in lossless format (FLAC).\r\n\r\nI will start to upload as much as I can, because I believe great works of art should be shared for all mankind  :)\r\n\r\nI also take requests, and remarks to improve my torrents (it's my first time creating torrents)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish you a pleasant listening, and don't forget to seed so that Music lives on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ec11e0110ac76660fdf94fcd46f01a92d7b79d","amp;dn":"Schumann+-+Piano+Works+-+Geza+Anda+%281956%2C+ORFEO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ec11e0110ac76660fdf94fcd46f01a92d7b79d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,236,17,224,17,10,199,102,96,253,249,79,205,70,240,26,146,215,183,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
