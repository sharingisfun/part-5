But the son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett says that the only real inheritance handed down from his parents was a philosophy: Forge your own path in life. It is a creed that has allowed him to follow his own passions, establish his own identity, and reap his own successes. \n\nTodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s society, Buffett posits, has begun to replace a work ethic, relishing what you do, with a wealth ethic, honoring the payoff instead of the process. We confuse privilege with material accumulation. Yet, by focusing more on substance and less on reward, we can open doors of opportunity and strive toward a greater sense of fulfillment. In clear and concise terms, Buffett reveals a great truth: Life is random, neither fair nor unfair. Our journey in life rarely follows a straight line but is often met with false starts, crises, and blunders. How we push through and persevere in these challenging moments is where we begin to create the life of our dreams.\n\nPersonal and revealing, instructive and intuitive, Life Is What You Make It is about transcending your circumstances, taking up the reins of your destiny, and living your life to the fullest..............\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:435da8d9711ea5fdb53d119a5d15498689e46104","amp;dn":"Life+Is+What+You+Make+It%3A+Find+Your+Own+Path+to+Fulfillment+%28Aud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"435da8d9711ea5fdb53d119a5d15498689e46104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,93,168,217,113,30,165,253,181,61,17,154,93,21,73,134,137,228,97,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
