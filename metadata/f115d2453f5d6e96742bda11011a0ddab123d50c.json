Controlled by the ruthless crime lord, Taha, a young righteous punk named LeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯to is determined to bring him down. When the boss retaliates by kidnapping his sister, Lola, a rescue attempt by LeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯to is destroyed by betrayal that gets him arrested and Lola kept in the clutches in Taha. Six months later, a crackerjack undercover cop named Damien is given a urgent mission: a neutron bomb has been stolen by Taha in District B13 which has an automatic timer function engaged and set to detonate in less than 24 hours. Now with time running out, Damien and LeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯to must work together to find and stop the bomb, but there is far more to this crisis than any of the field players realize.\n\nDirector: Pierre Morel\n\nStars:             Cyril Raffaelli, David Belle and Tony D'Amario\nimdb:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414852/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414852/&lt;/a&gt;      \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/lXOzP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/lXOzP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/vy0hO.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/vy0hO.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/tM8Hw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/tM8Hw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/zuCqC.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/zuCqC.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f115d2453f5d6e96742bda11011a0ddab123d50c","amp;dn":"District+B13+aka+Banlieue+13+%282004%29+720p+BRrip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f115d2453f5d6e96742bda11011a0ddab123d50c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,21,210,69,63,93,110,150,116,43,218,17,1,26,13,218,177,35,213,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
