Concerned with questions about reality, existence, time, identity and change, metaphysics has long fascinated people but to the uninitiated some of the issues and problems can appear very complex. In this lively and lucid book, Michael Rea examines and explains key questions in the study of metaphysics such as:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Can two things be in the same place at the same time?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Do creatures of fiction exist?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Are human beings free?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Is time travel possible?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Is there just one world or many worlds?\n\nWith a glossary of key terms and suggestions for further reading, the book considers key philosophical arguments around Metaphysics, making this an ideal starting point for anyone seeking a full introduction to the debates both within and about metaphysics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cbac0dd8776c4fa367322d9cf628c0998116f29","amp;dn":"Metaphysics%2C+The+Basics-+Michael+Rea+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cbac0dd8776c4fa367322d9cf628c0998116f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,186,192,221,135,118,196,250,54,115,34,217,207,98,140,9,152,17,111,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
