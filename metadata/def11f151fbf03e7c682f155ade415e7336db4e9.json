They performed classic Irish songs (&quot;The Water Is Wide,&quot; &quot;Green Grow the Rushes,&quot; &quot;A Woman's Heart&quot; and &quot;The Parting Glass&quot;), timeless pop anthems (&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;), and inspirational songs (&quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;) with their signature Celtic Woman twist, under the musical direction of David Downes.\n\nFor the first time ever, this Celtic Woman concert was taped in the United States, at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, GA. The group's sold-out performances at the former grand movie palace, now a designated National Historic Landmark, featured a dazzling array of visual and musical effects, including a 20-piece orchestra, seven-piece Celtic Woman band, 16-piece Atlanta bag pipe band and lush vocal harmonies from the 10-member Aontas Choir and a 30-member children's choir.\n\n\nTracks:\n01.
