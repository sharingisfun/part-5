Joseph Stalin, the dictator of the Soviet Union at the time, wanted to get hold of these rockets in his attempt to dominate the free world.\n\n Since the Soviets were the lesser of the two evils at this time of the war, the Soviet Union joined Britain's battle.\n\n This meant that the Allies could not battle the Soviets to prevent them from getting hold of the Vengeance Weapons, but rather, they had to race against them to make sure that the weapons did not fall into Stalin's hands.\n\n Players take control of Stephen Moore, an officer of the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), a precursor to the CIA.\n\n The events that take place in this game are invented, baring in mind that this storyline is completely fictitious and the &quot;weapons,&quot; if any, truly did fall into Soviet hands.\n\nWorld War II Combat: Road to Berlin Tech Info:-\n\nPublisher:Groove Games\nDeveloper:Direct Action\nGenre:Historic First-Person Shooter\nRelease Date:Apr 03, 2006 (US)\nESRB:MATURE\nESRB Descriptors:Blood and Gore, Violence\n\nGame Information:-\n\nConnectivity:Online\nOffline Modes:Competitive, Team Oriented\nOnline Modes:Competitive, Cooperative, Team Oriented\nNumber of Players:1-16\nNumber of Online Players:16 Online\nDirectX Version:v9.0\n\nSystem requirements:-\n\nOperating System:Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista\n\nSystem:P3 1Ghz or equivalent\n\nSystem RAM: 256 Mb\n\nCPU Speed:1 GHz\n\nRAM:512 MB \n\nVideo Card: 64 MB\n\nHard Drive Space:1000 MB\n\nWorld War II Combat: Road to Berlin Hints &amp; Cheats:-\n\nCodes:\n\n While playing the game, press &quot;.
