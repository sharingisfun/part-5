On that band's demise, Ford and Shaw fostered something as a reputation as remixers and producers, tweaking knobs for The Klaxons and Arctic Monkeys. Here, though, they return to the artist's chair in their own right - and if you were one of those people complaining they couldn't hear the 'rave' in new rave, Attack Decay Sustain Release should make you very happy. Tracks like &quot;Hustler&quot; and &quot;Tits &amp; Acid&quot; are unmistakably pitched for the dancefloor, layered constructions of wobbly bass, ecstatic analogue synthesiser washes, and rave blips, presented with a muscle reminiscent of their Parisian rave compatriots Justice. &quot;It's The Beat&quot;, featuring Ninja from The Go Team, takes a 'keep it simple, stupid' approach to lyrical ingenuity: &quot;You know it's the one for the treble/Two for the bass/It's the beat&quot;. And while in general, there's few signs of any remaining indie sensibilities, &quot;Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ- featuring guest vocals from Barry Dobbin of Clor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ features the sort of choppy punk-funk bass that should keep the Rapture fans happy. An impressive reinvention.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n&quot;Sleep Deprivation&quot; - 4:59\n&quot;I Got This Down&quot; - 4:09\n&quot;It's the Beat&quot; (J. Shaw, J.
