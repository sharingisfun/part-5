Ten more playable leagues were introduced for this version, including Australia, Greece, Northern Ireland, Russia and Wales. It was also the first version of the game to come with an official data editor - something which has been continued for all subsequent versions.\n\nThe Championship Manager series is a series of British football-management simulation computer games, the first of which was released in 1992.\n\nThe Championship Manager brand and game was conceived by two brothers: Paul and Oliver Collyer. In a scenario typical of many self-made computer game programming teams in the early days of the industry, the original Championship Manager game was written from their bedroom in Shropshire, England. Since then, they have founded a development company to take the game further, Sports Interactive, and are now based in Islington, North London.\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7f831bd7a3bfbeb3e14aa659b6df1107c61b22","amp;dn":"Championship.Manager.Season.00-01.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c7f831bd7a3bfbeb3e14aa659b6df1107c61b22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,127,131,27,215,163,191,190,179,225,74,166,89,182,223,17,7,198,27,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
