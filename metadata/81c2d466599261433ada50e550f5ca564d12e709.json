As a matter of fact, as soon as that bundle completed to 100%, I headed out of the country that same very afternoon.  And I've been away from home since.  Only returning yesterday.\n\nWhile away, I had an opportunity to stop by a few threads, and read some comments.  And I've got to say, I wasn't eager to return home to share anything more here.  Or perhaps even for the next few months, to be honest.  It wasn't so long ago that there was a sense of community within these threads.  It wasn't so long ago that a few prayer requests even started to surface here and there.  People were talking.  God was being glorified.  Music and prayer requests were being met.\n\nWell, as we all know, it's no longer like that here.  And I imagine that's perhaps why many of you regulars are no longer posting comments.  So I'll be blunt.  Your silence is contributing to me spending more of my time sharing elsewhere, and less time sharing here.  And because all of you can locate and download this music just as easily as I can, I lack that drive to do so for you.\n\nWe all ought to give a shout out to CJ4321 today.  CJ4321 registered an account here, and posted a few words in that last 42nd thread.  Telling me that he is responsible for finding new music for his Church Band to perform, and often times uses these bundles as a source for that music.  Brethren, please make no mistake about it, it is because of him (and only him) that I am eager to share this 43rd bundle today.\n\nCONTEMPORARY: Among The Thirsty, For King And Country, Phil King.
