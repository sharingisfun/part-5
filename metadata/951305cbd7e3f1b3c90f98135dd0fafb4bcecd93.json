He grew up as a Quaker.\n\n\nJames and his band The Hoodoo Men opened for Stevie Ray Vaughan for several tour dates in the U.S.. James also played guitar on Richard Marx's song &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;.\n\nIn 1988, following his association with Vaughan, James released his self-titled debut album, which yielded several international hit singles, as did the followup Sudden Stop. He presaged the mid-1990s swing music revival with his Colin James and the Little Big Band project, which released a successful first CD in 1993, followed by two others in 1998 and 2006, as well as a Christmas album in 2007.\n\nJames's worldwide popularity waned somewhat in the late 1990s, but he continued to release albums in rock, blues, and acoustic styles, in addition to his Little Big Band. In 2005, he gave a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to his home province of Saskatchewan.\n\nJames' backing band frequently includes members of the Vancouver-based band Odds, and he has co-written songs with Odds singer-guitarist Craig Northey. In February 2005, James guest-starred in an episode of the television program Corner Gas, a Canadian sitcom based in rural Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 2007, James' album Limelight received a Gold record for sales in Canada. In January 2008, James received three Toronto Blues Society Maple Blues Awards: &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot;, &quot;Electric Act of the Year&quot; and &quot;Recording of the Year&quot; for Colin James &amp; The Little Big Band 3.[1]\n\nIn 2009, James recorded an album, and amongst the collaborators were Tom Wilson, once of Junkhouse. The album, Rooftops and Satellites, was co-produced, engineered and mixed by Mike Fraser, at the Warehouse studios in Vancouver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin James 1988\n\n\nColin James is the debut album from Canadian rock/blues musician Colin James, released in 1988 (see 1988 in music). The album was recorded at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. The album earned James a Juno Award for &quot;Most Promising Artist&quot;.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Five Long Years&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n2.\t&quot;Voodoo Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n3.\t&quot;Down In The Bottom&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n4.\t&quot;Chicks 'n Cars (And The Third World War)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n5.\t&quot;Why'd You Lie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n6.\t&quot;Hidden Charms&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n7.\t&quot;Bad Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n8.\t&quot;Lone Wolf&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n9.\t&quot;Dream of Satin&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n10.\t&quot;Three Sheets To The Wind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSudden Stop 1990\n\n\nSudden Stop is the second studio album by Canadian blues musician Colin James released in 1990 (see 1990 in music) on Virgin Records.
