But a few individuals have overturned that image with what were considered at the time to be exciting, innovative self-builds.\n\nKevin McCloud reveals how self-builders in the suburbs are transforming this most maligned of residential environments. He draws on some of the best examples from the 15-year history of Grand Designs, talks to experts in the latest architectural thinking and reveals the designs that have reinvented the suburbs as a place where home-owners really can have it all.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 23-Jul-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb279aa70dc03a23ad2da89b6d675b3fc48b603a","amp;dn":"Grand.Designs.S15E03.480p.HDTV.x264-RMTeam.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb279aa70dc03a23ad2da89b6d675b3fc48b603a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,39,154,167,13,192,58,35,173,45,168,155,109,103,91,63,196,139,96,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
