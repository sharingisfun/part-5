Directed and co-written by Spike Lee, the film stars Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, Al Freeman, Jr., and Delroy Lindo. Lee has a small supporting role as Shorty, a character based partially on real-life acquaintance Malcolm &quot;Shorty&quot; Jarvis, a fellow criminal and jazz trumpeter. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and future South Africa president Nelson Mandela have cameo appearances.\n\nThe film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his incarceration, his conversion to Islam, his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites, and his assassination on February 21, 1965. Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks.\n\nMalcolm X's screenplay, co-credited to Lee and Arnold Perl, is based largely on Alex Haley's 1965 book, The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Haley collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X's death.\n\nMalcolm X was distributed by Warner Bros. and released on November 18, 1992. Denzel Washington won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.\n\nCast\n\nDenzel Washington as Malcolm X\nAngela Bassett as Betty X\nAlbert Hall as Baines\nAl Freeman, Jr. as Elijah Muhammad\nDelroy Lindo as West Indian Archie\nSpike Lee as Shorty\nRoger Guenveur Smith as Rudy\nTheresa Randle as Laura\nKate Vernon as Sophia\nLonette McKee as Louise Little\nTommy Hollis as Earl Little\nJames McDaniel as Brother Earl\nSteve White as Brother Johnson\nErnest Lee Thomas as Sidney\nJean-Claude La Marre as Benjamin 2X\nWendell Pierce as Ben Thomas\nGiancarlo Esposito as Thomas Hayer\nLeonard L.
