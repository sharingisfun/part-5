Released on August 24, 2004, it came two years after their third album, Electric Sweat. It was recorded in various locations, including Paramount Studios, Ameraycan Studios, and Decoy Studios, all located in Los Angeles, California. Of its content, the band said it is &quot;dense, kaleidoscopic, and that you could spend hours uncovering little nuggets of goodness.&quot; Many of the songs assume sexual innuendos, such as &quot;Primitive Condition&quot;, &quot;Alive &amp; Amplified&quot;, &quot;Shake That Bush Again&quot;, &quot;Loose 'n' Juicy&quot;, &quot;Messin' in the Dressin' Room&quot;, and &quot;Naked Lady&quot;. Of the song &quot;New York Girls&quot;, Sammy James, Jr. said &quot;I love the song California Girls, and the women of New York didn't get a fair shake in California Girls, and he thought the New York Girls needed their fair shake, so we gave that to them.&quot;\n\n1. &quot;Primitive Condition&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n2. &quot;Alive &amp; Amplified&quot; (James Jr., Tyler, Graham Edwards, Scott Spock, and Lauren Christy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n3. &quot;Legal High&quot; (James Jr., Tyler, Edwards, Spock, and Christy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50\n4. &quot;New York Girls&quot; (James Jr., Tyler, Edwards, Spock, and Christy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n5. &quot;Shake That Bush Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n6. &quot;Sometimes Somethin'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n7. &quot;Loose 'n' Juicy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n8. &quot;Hot Sugar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n9. &quot;Messin' in the Dressin' Room&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n10. &quot;Naked Lady&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:05\n\nHidden Track\n\nFind &quot;Love Bus&quot; by fast forwarding after &quot;Naked Lady&quot;.
