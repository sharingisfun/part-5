To count the ways: one, clear and consistent directions that anyone can translate into a professionally finished crafts item; two, color photographs that do all the work sans words, if necessary; three, sidebars filled with information that is impossible to ignore; and four, plenty of beginning background--tools, equipment, fabrics, techniques--that will allow anyone to jump in and succeed. Such are the benefits of the Complete Guide to Embroidery Stitches, more than 260 of them, each featuring procedures in words, illustrations, photographs, and a helpful hint or two. Along with the 21 different categories come robust instructions for finishing, storing, displaying, and cleaning embroidery. What else is there?\n\nNearly three hundred stitches from feather to drawn-thread stitches and beadwork receive visual embellishment and step-by-step illustration in the fine Complete Guide To Embroidery Stitches, a compendium divided into five main sections to cover embroidery on fabric, smocking, canvas work and more. From color value applications to step-by-step easy directions, each step receives visual drawings and hints for applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7b4d11db8ca5f13f45f6d5fa50810de16ae7134","amp;dn":"Complete+Guide+to+Embroidery+Stitches+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7b4d11db8ca5f13f45f6d5fa50810de16ae7134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,180,209,29,184,202,95,19,244,95,109,95,165,8,16,222,22,174,113,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
