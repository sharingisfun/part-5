With only horns and a drum set, &quot;Hypnotic&quot; has traveled the world. Their musical style ranges from hip-hop to jazz to funk and rock, including calypso and gypsie music. They call their eclectic blend of sound &quot;now music&quot;, or &quot;Hypnotic&quot;. Reared in the teachings of music since they were children, they grew up on the stage playing as the &quot;Phil Cohran Youth Ensemble&quot;.\n\nCollection including:\n\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - 2004 - Hypnotic Orange\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - 2005 - Hypnotic Green\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - 2008 - The Brothas\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - Highline Ballroom, NYC 10-29-07\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - Hypnotic Brass Ensemble (2009)\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - New York City Live 2007\n\nBalicky Bon.mp3\nHBEO0Z_SideB.mp3\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - Get The Party Started.mp3\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - Hypnotic.mp3\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - Mercury Live.mp3\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - Potato Back.mp3\nHypnotic Brass Ensemble - Tarik.mp3\nMake it Funky (live) Mos Def x HYPNOTIC.mp3\nFunky Drummer (live) Mos Def x HYPNOTIC.mp3\nWarf Freeway, Jay Z and Beanie Sigel Hypnotic Brass Ensemble mixed by Nick Catchdubs.mp3\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13ed5986b76d7f79d23b73ad513ea9e388cc6338","amp;dn":"Hypnotic+Brass+Ensemble+collection+%286+albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13ed5986b76d7f79d23b73ad513ea9e388cc6338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,237,89,134,183,109,127,121,210,59,115,173,81,62,169,227,136,204,99,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
