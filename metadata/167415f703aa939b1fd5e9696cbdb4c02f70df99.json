He later worked with the Beatles as they recorded their singles Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Loves YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Want to Hold Your Hand,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the songs that would propel them to international superstardom. In 1964 he would witness the transformation of this young and playful group from Liverpool into professional, polished musicians as they put to tape classic songs such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eight Days A WeekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Feel Fine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThen, in 1966, at age nineteen, Geoff Emerick became the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ chief engineer, the man responsible for their distinctive sound as they recorded the classic album Revolver, in which they pioneered innovative recording techniques that changed the course of rock history. Emerick would also engineer the monumental Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road albums, considered by many the greatest rock recordings of all time. In Here, There and Everywhere he reveals the creative process of the band in the studio, and describes how he achieved the sounds on their most famous songs. Emerick also brings to light the personal dynamics of the band, from the relentless (and increasingly mean-spirited) competition between Lennon and McCartney to the infighting and frustration that eventually brought a bitter end to the greatest rock band the world has ever known.&quot;\n\nFrom Booklist Reviews:\n&quot;Emerick was only 15 when he began working with the Beatles as an assistant engineer at Abbey Road Studios. Later, as a 19-year-old full engineer, he was on board for the seminal Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Always aiming for perfection, the Beatles never took no for an answer, and he did his best to oblige by developing innovative recording techniques, some simple (e.g., using a loudspeaker as a microphone), others more sophisticated. Being the Beatles' engineer wasn't entirely pleasant. Eventually, during the tense and uncomfortable White Album sessions, the Beatles barely spoke to one another without anger, and Emerick quit before recording was finished. But he returned to work on Abbey Road and several McCartney solo records, including Band on the Run. Anyone interested in the Beatles and their music ought to love Emerick's as-told-to insider's account of working with the world's most famous band when they made their most famous music.&quot; - June Sawyers\n\nThis torrent contains original EPUB and MOBI copies of the book as well as a large-text PDF conversion of the epub done in Calibre.
