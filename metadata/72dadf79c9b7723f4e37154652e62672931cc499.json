One of them I knew and the other IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never laid eyes on until I saw him in the morgue.\n\nThe first was a local PI of suspect reputation. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been gunned down near the beach at Santa Teresa. It looked like a robbery gone bad. The other was on the beach six weeks later. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been sleeping rough. Probably homeless. No identification. A slip of paper with MillhoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name and number was in his pants pocket. The coroner asked her to come to the morgue to see if she could ID him.\n\nTwo seemingly unrelated deaths, one a murder, the other apparently of natural causes.\n\nBut as Kinsey digs deeper into the mystery of the John Doe, some very strange linkages begin to emerge. And before long at least one aspect is solved as Kinsey literally finds the key to his identity. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And just like that,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the lid to PandoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s box flew open. It would take me another day before I understood how many imps had been freed, but for the moment, I was inordinately pleased with myself.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn this multilayered tale, the surfaces seem clear, but the underpinnings are full of betrayals, misunderstandings, and outright murderous fraud. And Kinsey, through no fault of her own, is thoroughly compromised.\n\nW is for . . . wanderer . . . worthless . . . wronged . . .\n\nW is for wasted.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadat is complet and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72dadf79c9b7723f4e37154652e62672931cc499","amp;dn":"W+is+for+Wasted+by+Sue+Grafton+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72dadf79c9b7723f4e37154652e62672931cc499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,218,223,121,201,183,114,63,78,55,21,70,82,230,38,114,147,28,196,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
