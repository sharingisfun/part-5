Weeks after she was diagnosed, filmmaker Kris Carr began documenting her story. Taking a seemingly tragic situation and turning it into a creative expression, Kris shares her inspirational story of survival with honesty, courage, and lots of humor. Crazy Sexy Cancer is more than a film, it's an attitude! It's about rising to the challenge of life, and no matter what, refusing to give up who you are at your core. This story is as funny as it is frightening, as joyous as it is outrageous. Ultimately, Crazy Sexy Cancer is a thought provoking film about friendship, love and growing up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9d9b728f96131f8ca590dcf368cf2c6de4e0ad6","amp;dn":"Crazy.Sexy.Cancer.2007.DVDrip.Audio.fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9d9b728f96131f8ca590dcf368cf2c6de4e0ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,217,183,40,249,97,49,248,202,89,13,207,54,140,242,198,222,78,10,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
