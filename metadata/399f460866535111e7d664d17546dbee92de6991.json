This time with a little less content, but since there was a lot of demand for the next part, I shoved it forward a little bit. With over 80 songs, this part is a lot smaller than the others, but you know what they say, quality over quantity.\nLike the last time all the songs are ripped in HQ and converted to 256kbps MP3s, which is a more than acceptable bitrate. This just might be the last part in the series, unless there is a good demand for more.\nAs always, if you like the music, support the artists, please seed, and, if you like what I'm doing, and would like to support my bandwidth costs, I always appreciate a bitcoin donation! Of course, there's no obligation whatsoever.\nBitcoin: 1A3T83fgbQ2d9EMPGVPBUL7ipKy4cuFwmi\n\nEnjoy and drop me a request if you need something!\n\nPS: I've noticed there are about three doubles in the tracklist, sorry about that!
