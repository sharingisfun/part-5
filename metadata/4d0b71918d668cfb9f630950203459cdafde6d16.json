The subject matter of each domain can easily be seen as its own area of study, and in many cases individuals work exclusively in these fields as experts. For many of these subjects, you can consult and reference extensive resources to become an expert in that area. Because of this, a common misconception is that the only way to succeed at the CISSP exam is to immerse yourself in a massive stack of texts and study materials. Fortunately, an easier approach exists. By using this sixth edition of the CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, you can successfully complete and pass the CISSP exam and achieve your CISSP certification.\n\nThe goal of this book is to combine into a single resource all the information you need to pass the CISSP exam and help you understand how the domains interact with each other so that you can develop a comprehensive approach to security practices. This book should also serve as a useful reference tool long after you've achieved your CISSP certification.\n\nTitle: CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, 6th Edition\nAuthor: Shon Harris\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Companies\nYear: 2013\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
