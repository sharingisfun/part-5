Between Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen, and Jennifer Connelly, there&amp;#039;s a romantic interest for both you and your sweetie. I&amp;#039;ve never lived in the South so I&amp;#039;m not sure you&amp;#039;d like the portrayals if you are from there, but even without the Southern setting, the deviousness and deceit are universal. After the first viewing, the plot twists may not surprise you anymore, but you&amp;#039;ll appreciate even more how justice and irony come into play in deciding the fate of the players. Highly recommended.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fb86f8965078f1a97ea09e0037208dfecab8926","amp;dn":"The+Hot+Spot+%5BDVDRip%5DXviD%5Bmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fb86f8965078f1a97ea09e0037208dfecab8926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,184,111,137,101,7,143,26,151,234,9,224,3,114,8,223,236,171,137,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
