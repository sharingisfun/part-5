Living at the height of the Victorian era, Cameron was anything but conventional, experimenting with the relatively new medium of photography, promoting her own art though exhibition and sale, and pursuing the eminent personalities of her ageÃ¢â‚¬â€Alfred Tennyson, Charles Darwin, Thomas Carlyle, and othersÃ¢â‚¬â€as subjects for her lens. For the first time, all known images by Cameron, one of the most important nineteenth-century artists in any medium, are gathered together in a catalogue raisonnÃƒÂ©. \n\nIn addition to a complete catalogue of CameronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s photographs, there is information on her life and times, initial experiments, artistic aspirations, techniques, small-format images, albums, commercial strategies, sitters, and sources of inspiration. Also provided are a selected bibliography of publications on Cameron, a list of exhibitions of her work held both in her time as well as our own, and a summary of important collections where her pictures can be found.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a36f809257e566b6d58783176f33c4fe5406c8","amp;dn":"Julia+Margaret+Cameron+-+Complete+Photos+%28Art+Photography+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a36f809257e566b6d58783176f33c4fe5406c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,163,111,128,146,87,229,102,182,213,135,131,23,111,51,196,254,84,6,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
