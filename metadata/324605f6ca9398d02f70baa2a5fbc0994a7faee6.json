In so doing, he uncovers the truth that all our attempts to call any strong work more sacred than another are merely political and social formulations. This is literary criticism at its best.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Bloom's puissance is not entirely his own; for some of it, he is indebted to Nietzsche, Freud, Schopenhauer, Gershom Scholem, and other masters. But enough of it is his own to constitute a distinctive form of splendor.&quot; -- Denis Donoghue, The New York Review of Books\n\n&quot;In some ways the wildest of the wild men (and women), in some ways the most traditional of the traditionalists, Harold Bloom remains serene amid the turbulence--much of it caused by him. He stands dauntless, a party of one, as thrilling to behold up on the high wire as he is (at times) throttling to read on the pageÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ From this strong critic dealing with these strong poets comes a potent mix of insight.&quot; -- Mark Feeney, The Boston Globe\n\n&quot;The wit, the eclecticism and the gripping paradoxes Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the force of [Bloom's] intellect carries the reader from pinnacle to pinnacle, showing a new spiritual landscape from each.&quot; -- Roger Scruton, The Washington Times\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324605f6ca9398d02f70baa2a5fbc0994a7faee6","amp;dn":"Harold+Bloom+-+Ruin+the+Sacred+Truths+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324605f6ca9398d02f70baa2a5fbc0994a7faee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,70,5,246,202,147,152,208,47,112,186,162,165,251,192,153,74,127,174,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
