But his career was marred by drug addiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988bcaf7d24ea1e6b0b30b05a121462ef55eecbb","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988bcaf7d24ea1e6b0b30b05a121462ef55eecbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,139,202,247,210,78,161,230,176,179,11,5,161,33,70,46,245,94,236,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
