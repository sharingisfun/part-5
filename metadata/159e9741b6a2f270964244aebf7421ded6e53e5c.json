He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  \n\nAlthough Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.\n\nDriven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:159e9741b6a2f270964244aebf7421ded6e53e5c","amp;dn":"Steve+Jobs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"159e9741b6a2f270964244aebf7421ded6e53e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,158,151,65,182,162,242,112,150,66,68,174,191,116,33,222,214,229,62,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
