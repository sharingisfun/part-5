Homeboy  ----------------------------------------------------------------------SLAVE was an Ohio funk band popular in the 1970s and early 1980s. Trumpeter Steve Washington and Mark Hicks (Drac) formed the group in Dayton, Ohio in 1975. --- Trombonist Floyd Miller teamed with Tom Lockett Jr. on sax, [keyboards]Charter Bradley, [bass]Mark Adams, [lead and rhythm guitar]Mark Hicks, [lead and rhythm guitar, lead/background vocals]Danny Webster, Orion Wilhoite on sax, and [drums]Tim Dozier. Vocalists Steve Arrington and Starleana Young then Curt Jones came aboard in 1978, with Arrington ultimately becoming lead vocalist. Their first big hit was the single &quot;Slide&quot; in 1977 for Cotillion Records, where they remained until 1984. Their best work was usually based on bass licks and the band's general arrangements emphasis on the rhythm section and soaring lead vocals, which were at time very intense and hypnotic.[citation needed]. Their song &quot;Watching You&quot; exemplifies all of these qualities.\n\n\nOther Top Ten R&amp;B hits were &quot;Just a Touch of Love&quot; in 1979, &quot;Watching You&quot; in 1980, and &quot;Snap Shot&quot; in 1981. They added Charles Carter on sax. Young, Washington, Jones and Lockett departed to form Aurra in 1981. They added Roger Parker, Sam Carter, Delburt Taylor, and Kevin Johnson as replacements. Arrington himself left in 1982 after the Showtime album. Slave continued on, though much less successfully, into the late 1980s.\n\n\nThey moved to Atlantic Records for one LP in 1984, then switched to the Atlanta-based Ichiban in 1986 for singles and LPs that were just a shade of the former vibrant Slave sound. Their most recent release was The Funk Strikes Back in 1992. Rhino issued Stellar Fungk: The Best of Slave Featuring Steve Arrington, an anthology of their finest cuts, in 1994.
