Oh, no. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“other womanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ had to be her best friend EvanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiancÃƒÂ©e. Not only has she lost her marriage, she fears losing Evan to the lingering awkwardness and humiliation that hangs between them.\n\nEvan has no intention of letting that happen. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got plansÃ¢â‚¬Â¦namely, an extra plane ticket to Hawaii now his future wife is out of the picture. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one person he wants on the trip with him, the one whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been there for him. The one he should never have let slip away into the arms of a traitorous friend who shattered her heart.\n\nKelsey is anticipating a week of fun in the sun with the man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always treated her like a little sister. No oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more surprised when she discovers that Evan has seduction on his mindÃ¢â‚¬â€and that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than ready for it.\n\nLove is the most powerful healing force of all. But past demons have a way of ripping open old wounds, and threatening the survival of even the strongest friendshipÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n                      **Note: No Table of Contents** \n\n\n\n                            Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                            Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n          **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n             Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69dbc7dcec858428c50e93844b411a8c108b2a0a","amp;dn":"Unleashed+by+Cherrie+Lynn+%28Ross+Siblings+Book+1%29+%5BReq%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69dbc7dcec858428c50e93844b411a8c108b2a0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,219,199,220,236,133,132,40,197,14,147,132,75,65,26,140,16,139,42,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
