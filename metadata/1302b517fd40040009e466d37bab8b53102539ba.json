They didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand that once love -- the deliria -- blooms in your blood, there is no escaping its hold. Things are different now. Scientists are able to eradicate love, and the governments demands that all citizens receive the cure upon turning eighteen. Lena Holoway has always looked forward to the day when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be cured. A life without love is a life without pain: safe, measured, predictable, and happy.\n\nBut with ninety-five days left until her treatment, Lena does the unthinkable: She falls in love.\n\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 192 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1302b517fd40040009e466d37bab8b53102539ba","amp;dn":"Lauren+Oliver+-+Delirium+%28Delirium+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1302b517fd40040009e466d37bab8b53102539ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,2,181,23,253,64,4,0,9,228,102,211,123,171,139,83,16,37,57,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
