He is arguably the leading record producer in the world, having worked with icons like Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Peter Gabriel, Robbie Robertson, and of course most famously, U2. He is less well known for his solo albums, but efforts like Acadie, Shine, and For the Beauty of Wynona are definitely worth your time. Oh, I guess I did the introduction anyway. Joining Lanois in Black Dub are the renowned drummer Brian Blade, and respected bass player Daryl Johnson.\n\nThe real discovery here is the powerful young singer Trixie Whitley. She is the daughter of the late great Chris Whitley, and an amazing talent in her own right. Hers is one of the most thrilling voices to come along in years. Whitley has come a long way from the times that I used to see her as a small child when her dad would bring her along to the gigs. \n\nMake no mistake, when it comes to the sound of this album, there is no doubt who the producer of this music is. Daniel Lanois has brought his singular sound to these 11 tracks, investing each one of them with his visionary concepts. Lanois has steeped the album in the culture of the Jamaican dub music that he loves, and Blade and Johnson play an integral part in building the rock solid foundation that allows LanoisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ guitar playing to venture off into new territory. The music is dense and dark, while still managing to preserve the spacious soundscapes that Lanois is noted for. Add WhitleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intense, emotional vocals on top, and you have a nearly perfect storm of sound. This music is old school, played by real musicians in the studio, live, often in one take.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/26/black-dub/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/26/black-dub/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5945c67ca3cd85158160a6d7dcf4905490cfdb2d","amp;dn":"Black+Dub...Black+Dub%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5945c67ca3cd85158160a6d7dcf4905490cfdb2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,69,198,124,163,205,133,21,129,96,166,215,220,244,144,84,144,207,219,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
