Huzzah!\n    Delayed generation of Red (level 5) quests one dungeon/region level. This should ensure that less quest spots get taken up by L5 quests when players are just starting to get access to Yellow (L3) quests.\n    Surprise chance tuning in brighter light levels: reduced chance of hero surprise; increased chance of monster surprise\n    Options - Added Blur effect options\n    MAA no longer ripostes when stunned\n    Fixed stress poptext queing issues\n    Fixed issue where provisions were having Trinket purchase discount applied.
