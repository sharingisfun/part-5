Marley's music gave voice to the day-to-day struggles of the Jamaican experience, vividly capturing not only the plight of the country's impoverished and oppressed but also the devout spirituality that remains their source of strength. His songs of faith, devotion, and revolution created a legacy that continues to live on not only through the music of his extended family but also through generations of artists the world over touched by his genius.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Iron Lion Zion\n02.Could You Be Loved\n03.Is This Love\n04.I Shot The Sheriff\n05.Jamming\n06.One Love\n07.No Woman, No Cry\n08.Get Up Stand Up\n09.Buffalo Soldier\n10.Exodus\n11.Sun Is Shining\n12.Roots Rock Reggae\n13.So Much Trouble In The World\n14.Waiting In Vain\n15.Three Little Birds\n16.Stir It Up\n17.Satisfy My Soul\n18.Punky Reggae Party\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Positive Vibration\n02.Survival\n03.Kaya\n04.Keep On Moving\n05.Lively Up Yourself\n06.Concrete Jungle\n07.Africa Unite\n08.Easy Skanking\n09.Chant Down Babylon\n10.Kinky Reggae\n11.Natural Mystic\n12.Put It On\n13.Ride Natty Ride\n14.Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)\n15.Zion Train\n16.One Drop\n17.Duppy Conqueror\n18.Rebel Music (3 O'Clock Road Block)\n19.Zimbabwe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
