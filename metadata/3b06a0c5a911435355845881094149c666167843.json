Because of the supercharged political climate of the era, critics read all sorts of allegory and hidden meanings into the Firemen's Ball. Other critics simply accepted the film as the slapsticky tale of a disastrous small-town celebration in honor of a retiring fire chief, and laughed accordingly.\n\n  General\n      Complete name : The Fireman's Ball.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 13mn\n      Bit rate : 2644 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 4.93 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : English\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 13mn\n      Bit rate : 2448 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.331\n      StreamSize : 1.26 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 13mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Video0 delay : 306ms\n      StreamSize : 101 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0061781\n\nCriterion Collection Rip\n\nCzech audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese BR subtitles\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by vanjah.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b06a0c5a911435355845881094149c666167843","amp;dn":"The+Firemans+Ball+-+Milos+Forman+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b06a0c5a911435355845881094149c666167843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,6,160,197,169,17,67,83,85,132,88,129,9,65,73,198,102,22,120,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
