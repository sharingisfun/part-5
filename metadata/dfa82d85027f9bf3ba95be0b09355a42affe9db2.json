But when he opens his box of crayons, he finds only letters, all saying the same thing: We quit!\n\nBeige is tired of playing second fiddle to Brown. Blue needs a break from coloring all that water, while Pink just wants to be used. Green has no complaints, but Orange and Yellow are no longer speaking to each other. \n\nWhat is Duncan to do? Debut author Drew Daywalt and New York Times bestseller Oliver Jeffers create a colorful solution in this playful, imaginative story that will have children laughing and playing with their crayons in a whole new way.\n\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Humor | Art\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa82d85027f9bf3ba95be0b09355a42affe9db2","amp;dn":"The+Day+the+Crayons+Quit+%5BPDF%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa82d85027f9bf3ba95be0b09355a42affe9db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,168,45,133,2,127,155,243,186,149,190,11,9,53,90,66,175,254,157,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
