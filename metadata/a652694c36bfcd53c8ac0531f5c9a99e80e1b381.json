On LD-3926 from 1979 Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChÃƒÂ©quere-sonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is replaced by Ã¢â‚¬Å“CamagÃƒÂ¼eyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nIt's hard to say why this happened, but when EGREM issued the egregiously under-documented 11-CD Ã¢â‚¬Å“La ColecciÃƒÂ³nÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, they very unfortunately used LD-3926, calling it Vol. 3, even though most or all of its tracks were recorded and released before the album they called Vol. 2!!!
