With magisterial learning and the elan of a born storyteller, Pagels turns Satan's story into an audacious exploration of Christianity's shadow side, in which the gospel of love gives way to irrational hatreds that continue to haunt Christians and non-Christians alike.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91fff66ad9983afc8a7ac7361cf8328946a33a61","amp;dn":"The+Origin+of+Satan+-+Elaine+Pagels++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91fff66ad9983afc8a7ac7361cf8328946a33a61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,255,246,106,217,152,58,252,138,122,199,54,28,248,50,137,70,163,58,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
