For Art Blakey! Thank yowww!&quot;\n\nWhen Pee-Wee Marquette, emcee of Birdland, introduces Art Blakey and his quintet, the audience in attendance erupts in enthusiastic applause. Rightly so; this is a powerful group in full stride. A NIGHT AT BIRDLAND captures Blakey&amp;#039;s pre-Messengers quintet on an evening in February 1954 with legendary trumpeter Clifford Brown and alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson holding down the front line. Longtime partners Blakey and pianist Horace Silver, as well as talented bassist Curley Russell, propel the relentless rhythm section.\n\nThe results of that eventful night are now preserved so that we may become patrons of the once legendary nightspot. The fiery mambo &quot;Split Kick&quot; opens the set showcasing Blakey&amp;#039;s assertive drumming and the fine blowing of Brown and Donaldson. Silver&amp;#039;s bebop-style &quot;Quicksilver&quot; also provides a stunning vehicle for the group&amp;#039;s lightning-quick dexterity. Turning the tide, the slow and sultry &quot;Blues&quot; is a totally improvised jam that provides some down-and-dirty solos by the horns and piano. Of course, the highlight of the set is Dizzy Gillespie&amp;#039;s &quot;A Night In Tunisia,&quot; a piece that would become a Messengers favorite. Finally, Silver&amp;#039;s up-tempo &quot;Mayreh&quot; closes the set on a high note with raucous solos all around.\n\nPersonnel: \nArt Blakey (drums)\nLou Donaldson (alto saxophone)\nClifford Brown (trumpet)\nHorace Silver (piano)\nCurly Russell (bass).\n\nRecorded live at Birdland, New York, New York on February 21, 1954.\n\nDisc 1:\n1.Announcement By Pee Wee Marquette\n2.Split Kick\n3.Once In A While\n4.Quicksilver\n5.A Night In Tunisia\n6.Mayreh\n7.Wee Dot - (alternate take, bonus track)\n8.Blues - (bonus track)\n\nDics 2:\n1.Wee Dot\n2.If I Had You\n3.Quicksilver - (alternate take)\n4.Now&amp;#039;s The Time\n5.Confirmation\n6.
