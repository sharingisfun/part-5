Key features Comprehensive treatment of optical-link constituents such as optical fibers, light sources, photo detectors, connecting and coupling devices and optical amplifiers. Design principles of digital and analog optical fiber transmission links, including optical power budgets, signal rise times, line coding and noise effects on system performance. Operating principles of WDM and its components are explained. Architecture and performance of Optical Networks explained in detail. Advanced communication techniques such as solitude transmission, optical CDMS, and ultrafast time division multiplexing discussed. Comprehensive treatment of optical-link constituents such as optical fibers, light sources, photo detectors, connecting and coupling devices and optical amplifiers.
