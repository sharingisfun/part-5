But ArethaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first single for Atlantic, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was her first defining career moment, the point where she made good on her considerable promise, and it was clear that producer and Atlantic co-owner Jerry Wexler understood FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abilities in a way Columbia did not.\nAretha FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s years at Atlantic brought her commercial success and a well-earned reputation as AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest soul singer, and The Queen of Soul is a four-disc set that brings togetherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n87 songs from FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1967-1979 tenure with the label. On the surface, this doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t appear to be an especially impressive collection; the artwork is nothing to write home about, the skimpy liner notes contain only credits, and while some rare B-sides and outtakes have been included, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing here that hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t popped up on other Franklin anthologies in the past. But give this a spin and nearly all quibbles are forgotten: no matter what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing, Franklin sounds excellent on this material, ranging from soul classics to pop standards to deep gospel, and if the hits and acknowledged classics dominate this set, the sheer scope of these four discs leaves room for some welcome surprises (such as a cover of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eleanor RigbyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that Franklin reworks into the first person, and a Johnny Ace tribute that melds Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pledging My LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ClockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and the emotional force and innate intelligence of ArethaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performances are evident no matter what she does. (And the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, her backing band on many of these selections, know exactly what to do with these songs, and hearing them interact with Franklin is a big part of the pleasure of this music.) The Queen of Soul is hardly the definitive Aretha Franklin set, or the career-spanning cross-licensed box set she deserves, but as an introduction to her peak years at Atlantic, this is splendid stuff and a rewarding listen from front to back.\n\nCD 1, Tracks 1-10 from I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, Atlantic LP 8139, 1967\nCD 1, Tracks 11-17 from Aretha Arrives, Atlantic LP 8150, 1967\nCD 1, Track 18 outtake from Aretha Arrives, first released on Rare and Unreleased Recordings from the Golden Reign of the Queen of Soul, Atlantic/Rhino CD R2 272188, 2007\nCD 1, Tracks 19-25 from Lady Soul, Atlantic LP 8176, 1968\nCD 2, Tracks 1-3, 5-8 &amp; 10 from Aretha Now, Atlantic LP 8186, 1968\nCD 2, Track 4 from Atlantic single 2546-B, 1968\nCD 2, Track 9 from Atlantic single 2574-B, 1968\nCD 2, Track 11 from Aretha in Paris, Atlantic LP 8207, 1968\nCD 2, Track 16 outtake from Soul Ã¢â‚¬â„¢69, first released on Rare and Unreleased Recordings from the Golden Reign of the Queen of Soul, Atlantic/Rhino CD R2 272188, 2007\nCD 2, Tracks 12-15 &amp; 17 from Soul Ã¢â‚¬â„¢69, Atlantic LP 8212, 1969\nCD 2, Tracks 18-19, 21-25 and CD 3, Tracks 1 &amp; 4 from This GirlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in Love with You, Atlantic LP 8248, 1970\nCD 2, Track 20 from Atlantic single 2650-B, 1969\nCD 3, Tracks 2-3, 5, 7-9, 11-12 from Spirit in the Dark, Atlantic LP 8265, 1970\nCD 3, Track 6 outtake from Spirit in the Dark, first released on Atlantic Blues: Vocalists, Atlantic 81696, 1986\nCD 3, Track 10 outtake from Spirit in the Dark, first released on Atlantic Unearthed: Soul Sisters, Atlantic/Rhino CD 77626, 2006\nCD 3, Tracks 13-14 &amp; CD 4, Tracks 1-5 from Young, Gifted and Black, Atlantic LP 7213, 1972\nCD 3, Track 15 from Atlantic single 2787, 1971\nCD 3, Track 16 from Atlantic single 2796, 1971\nCD 3, Tracks 17-18 from Atlantic single 2817, 1971\nCD 3, Track 19 from Live at Fillmore West, Atlantic LP 7205, 1971\nCD 4, Tracks 6-8 from Amazing Grace, Atlantic LP 2-906, 1972\nCD 4, Track 9 from Atlantic single 2941, 1973\nCD 4, Tracks 10-12 from Hey Now Hey (The Other Side of the Sky), Atlantic LP 7265, 1973\nCD 4, Tracks 13-15 from Let Me in Your Life, Atlantic LP 7292, 1974\nCD 4, Tracks 16-18 from Sparkle, Atlantic LP 18176, 1976\n\nCD 1, Tracks 1-20 &amp; CD 2, Tracks 4, 9 &amp; 16 appear in mono; all other tracks appear in stereo.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c484113ca265c31fa07f606c9373e005eda644f3","amp;dn":"Aretha+Franklin+-+The+Queen+of+Soul+%282014%29+4CD+Box+FLAC+Beolab17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c484113ca265c31fa07f606c9373e005eda644f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,132,17,60,162,101,195,31,160,127,96,108,147,115,224,5,237,166,68,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
