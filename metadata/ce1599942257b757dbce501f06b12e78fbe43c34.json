To support this theory Talbot sites many studies of physics, mysticism, metaphysics, and even describes some of his own personal experiences which are relevant to the topic. I came across this book in a thrift store and could not put it down until I was finished. This book is extremely interesting and is a must-read for anyone with any mild interest in the forementioned subjects. Read with an open mind as Michael Talbot attempts to explain his understanding of reality and existence!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce1599942257b757dbce501f06b12e78fbe43c34","amp;dn":"The+Holographic+Universe+%7Bdocx+%26amp%3B+PDF%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce1599942257b757dbce501f06b12e78fbe43c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,21,153,148,34,87,183,87,219,206,80,31,6,177,46,120,251,228,60,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
