Goya's art belonged to the people; his grotesque and irreverent figures, dashed off with rapid brushstrokes or quick flicks of pen or pencil, are the unvarnished projections of a milieu whose vices and virtues he distorted in a series of fantastic and often irrational configurations. He portrayed the whole thing with extraordinary artistic vitality, as well as with an impressive degree of realism, in a wide range of shades and colors of beautifully controlled intensity, without any of the verindulgence in technical minutiae that typifies a certain brand of academic art. For the first time in the history of art the ordinary people were thrust into the foreground: the revelation of their grief and suffering reflects the way in which Goya shared the wounded feelings of his fellow countrymen in the anti- Napoleonic uprising of 1808","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:611533c8bc0c7bda9ae12d3d96f986afb4940129","amp;dn":"Goya+%28The+Hidden+Masters+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"611533c8bc0c7bda9ae12d3d96f986afb4940129","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,21,51,200,188,12,123,218,154,225,45,61,150,249,134,175,180,148,1,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
