His wife, Deb, gladly left behind a difficult career as a dancer to raise the two children she adores. In the ensuing years, she has mostly avoided coming face-to-face with the weaknesses of the man she married. But then an anonymously sent package arrives in the mail: a cardboard box containing sheaves of printed emails chronicling JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret life. The package is addressed to Deb, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivered into the wrong hands: her childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n \nWith this vertiginous opening begins a debut that is by turns funny, wise, and indescribably moving. As the Shanleys spin apart into separate orbits, leaving New York in an attempt to regain their bearings, fifteen-year-old Simon feels the allure of adult freedoms for the first time, while eleven-year-old Kay wanders precariously into a grown-up world she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t possibly understand. Writing with extraordinary precision, humor, and beauty, Julia Pierpont has crafted a timeless, hugely enjoyable novel about the bonds of family lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€their brittleness, and their resilience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b76ead31f48a1a5b7e50b7b12ec88c7b7a0c2cd","amp;dn":"Among+the+Ten+Thousand+Things+-+Julia+Pierpont","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b76ead31f48a1a5b7e50b7b12ec88c7b7a0c2cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,118,234,211,31,72,161,165,183,229,11,123,18,236,136,199,183,160,194,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
