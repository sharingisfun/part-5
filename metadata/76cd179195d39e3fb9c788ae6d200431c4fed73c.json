The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sharing the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you.\n\nRead the familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help the Kaplans if they know thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a ghost in the house. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you to decide how DanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost.\n\nThe decisions you make will define the KaplansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76cd179195d39e3fb9c788ae6d200431c4fed73c","amp;dn":"The+Novelist+-+Mac+-+osXTC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76cd179195d39e3fb9c788ae6d200431c4fed73c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,205,23,145,149,211,158,63,185,199,136,174,109,32,4,49,196,254,215,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
