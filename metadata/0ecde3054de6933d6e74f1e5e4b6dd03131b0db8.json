Chaos reigns in the streets, medical treatment is no longer available, and a silent coup has placed a dangerous group of men at the helm of a false government. AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate is in the hands of those few individuals who have the survival skills, the faith, and the forethought to return this country to the state its founding fathers intended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ecde3054de6933d6e74f1e5e4b6dd03131b0db8","amp;dn":"Founders%3A+A+Novel+of+the+Coming+Collapse+-+James+Wesley+Rawles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ecde3054de6933d6e74f1e5e4b6dd03131b0db8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,205,227,5,77,230,147,61,110,116,241,229,228,182,221,3,19,27,13,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
