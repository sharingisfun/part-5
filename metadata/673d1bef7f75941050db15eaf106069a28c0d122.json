He wrote more than 20 novels, six volumes of poetry, a memoir, various short stories, radio and television scripts, along with works of social and literary criticism. According to his biographer, Zachary Leader, Amis was &quot;the finest English comic novelist of the second half of the twentieth century.&quot; He is the father of British novelist Martin Amis. In 2008, The Times ranked Kingsley Amis ninth on their list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.\n\nAmis is chiefly known as a comedic novelist of mid- to late-20th-century British life, but his literary work extended into many genres Ã¢â‚¬â€ poetry, essays and criticism, short stories, food and drink writing, anthologies, and a number of novels in genres such as science fiction and mystery. His career initially developed in a pattern which was the inverse of that followed by his close friend Philip Larkin. Before becoming known as a poet, Larkin had published two novels; Amis, on the other hand, originally wished to be a poet, and turned to writing novels only after publishing several volumes of verse. He continued throughout his career to write poetry which is known for its typically straightforward and accessible style, yet which often masks a nuance of thought, for example, in &quot;Bookshop Idyll&quot; or &quot;Against Romanticism&quot;, just as it does in his novels. Amis's first novel, Lucky Jim (1954), is perhaps his most famous, taking its germ from Amis's observation of the common room at the University of Leicester, where his friend Larkin held a post.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe torrent contains all the book in ePUB format:\n\n* Colonel Sun - A James Bond Adventure\n\n* Difficulties with Girls\n\n* Everyday Drinking\n\n* Girl, 20\n\n* Jake's Thing\n\n* Lucky Jim\n\n* Russian Hide-and-Seek\n\n* Stanley and the Women\n\n* The Alteration\n\n* The Anti-Death League\n\n* The Folks That Live on the Hill\n\n* The Green Man\n\n* The King's English - A Guide to Modern Usage\n\n* The Old Devils\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsley_Amis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsley_Amis&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3772/the-art-of-fiction-no-59-kingsley-amis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3772/the-art-of-fiction-no-59-kingsley-amis&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.drunkard.com/issues/08_05/0805_kingsley.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.drunkard.com/issues/08_05/0805_kingsley.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2011/dec/08/fielding-oxbridge-interview-by-kingsley-amis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2011/dec/08/fielding-oxbridge-interview-by-kingsley-amis&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:673d1bef7f75941050db15eaf106069a28c0d122","amp;dn":"Kingsley+Amis+-+Lucky+Jim+%26amp%3B+Other+Works+%2814+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"673d1bef7f75941050db15eaf106069a28c0d122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,61,27,239,127,117,148,16,80,219,21,234,241,6,6,154,40,192,209,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
