From time immemorial the forces of evil from beyond have been trying to manifest themselves in our world, and it is only through the actions of these forgotten heroes that the world has been saved from being overrun. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword and gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.\n\nThe game features an involved Magick system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.\n\nEternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items. Aside from this, characters also have health and mana meters. \n\nFeatures RePack:\nGame settings - as in the full version of PC-\nGood performance\nThe sound in the game is not lost\nUsed edited emulator Dolphin 3.5 r13XX\nAdditional software (DirectX, Microsoft Visual C + + Redist 64 bit)\nBilingual installer (English/Russian)\nInstallation: 5-10 minutes\nIn the game folder (&quot;Bonus&quot;) is the Full Soundtrack (in avi format).\nAssembled by: Ma2012ks Ã‚Â© - EmuGames \n\n\nInstallation noteS:\n1.
