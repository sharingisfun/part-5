Although there are only 12 tracks and some of Patton's defining tunes, these performances capture the spirit of Patton and show how his legacy extends to contemporary blues musicians. There really isn't a bad or misguided track here (unusual for tribute discs), a situation helped by the quality and pedigree of the musicians involved, who seek to maintain the rawness of Patton's blues. Certainly keeping the predominantly unplugged music stripped to just guitar or harmonica or both maintains the focus. Delta-based artists such as Corey Harris and Dave Van Ronk turn in fine if unsurprising performances. But the unexpected addition of Brit pub rocker Graham Parker works surprisingly well, as his gritty voice (although not necessarily rudimentary guitar) does justice to 'Poor Me.' Harpist Charlie Musselwhite sticks to guitar for an ominous yet sweet 'Pea Vine Blues,' but it's Joe Louis Walker's incendiary seven-and-a-half-minute version of 'Sugar Mama' and the closing medley of 'Down the Dirt Road Blues'/'When Your Way Gets Dark,' sung with a sexy, knockout approach by the album's only female vocalist, Colleen Sexton, clocking in at nearly ten minutes, that are the album's highlights.\nThey open up these songs, leaving room for improvisation that expands the concepts but stays true to Patton's originals.\nOne of the most successful albums of this type, this is an excellent (and well-recorded) introduction to the music of one of the touchstones of the blues.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd69b34d21dcbbc67c4e51cb2c0adf69d6bebab7","amp;dn":"%28Blues+VA%29+The+Songs+Of+Charley+Patton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd69b34d21dcbbc67c4e51cb2c0adf69d6bebab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,105,179,77,33,220,187,198,124,78,81,203,44,10,223,105,214,190,186,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
