As a result, snipers are regarded as the elite of their units and their skills command the ungrudging respect of their fellows - and the enemy. The Author is one such man who recently served a full tour of duty with 1st Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. \n\nJames describes the highs and lows of almost daily front line action experienced by our soldiers deployed on active service in arguably the most dangerous area of the world. As part of the Battle GroupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crack Mobile Operations Group, JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission was to liquidate as many Taliban as possible. The reader experiences sniper tactics and actions, whether in ambush or quick pre-planned strikes, amid the ever present lethal danger of IEDs. \n\nHis book, the first to written by a trained sniper in Afghanistan, reveals the psychological pressures and awesome life-and-death responsibility of his role and, in particular, the deadly cat-and-mouse Ã¢â‚¬ËœgamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with the enemy snipers intent on their own kills. These involved the clinical killing of targets at ranges of 1,000 meters or greater. Sniper in Helmand is a thrilling action-packed, yet very human, account of both front line service in the intense Afghanistan war and firsthand sniper action. Andy McNab inspired James to join the army and has written a moving foreword","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26470ba2854a3f850e4cf09e8685f060d69b255e","amp;dn":"Sniper+in+Helmand%3A+Six+Months+on+the+Frontline","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26470ba2854a3f850e4cf09e8685f060d69b255e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,71,11,162,133,74,63,133,14,76,240,158,134,133,240,96,214,155,37,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
