Of the many good books on motors, such as Electric Motors and Drives by Hughes, none offer the engineering professional a tailored guide to motors taking into account their expertise. This book fills that gap.\n\nPractical approach with minimum theory. Covers a core area ignored by many electronics texts. Shows how to incorporate motors into electronic products.\n\nIrving Gottlieb is a leading author of many books for practising engineers, technicians and students of electronic and electrical engineering.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0dcabde2e5f37b4ec88f544a7b1b5722c7e5c8","amp;dn":"Practical+Electric+Motor+Handbook+%5BGottlieb%5D+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0dcabde2e5f37b4ec88f544a7b1b5722c7e5c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,13,202,189,226,229,243,123,78,200,143,84,74,123,27,87,34,199,229,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
