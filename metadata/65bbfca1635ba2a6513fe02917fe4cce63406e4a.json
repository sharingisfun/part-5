The DEX user interface emulates the look and feel of CD Decks and includes mixer controls much like you find on physical DJ mixers. Use a traditional 2-Deck interface with or without video mixing controls, or layer in your mix with one of the included 4-Deck skins. BPM beat-sync, looping, key-lock, hot cue points, filters and effects all work flawlessly whether youÃ­re mixing audio or blending music videos.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Media File Browser With Search, Playlists And Automix\r\n\r\n\r\n65+ COMPATIBLE DJ CONTROLLERS\r\nDJ Controllers provide hands-on tactile control over PCDJ DEX, allowing for more creativity while mixing.

When you press a button, twist a knob or scratch a platter on your DJ controller PCDJ will react immediately, without latency.\r\n\r\nDJ Music And Music Videos For DJs\r\n\r\n\r\nDEX 3 Features\r\n-Up to 4 DJ decks (two for video and karaoke) with professional grade mixer and playlists\r\n-Two mode skin, complete with Audio and Video Tabs\r\n\r\n-Fully manual or automatic mixing (one-click beat-matching)\r\n-Video mixing (including pitch, break, reverse, scratch video)\r\n-Video effects, Video transitions and NEW Video Mix Recording\r\n-Karaoke Singers List.
