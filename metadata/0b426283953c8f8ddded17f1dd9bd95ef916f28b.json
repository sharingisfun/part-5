Discrete-event system (DES)-M&amp;S is used in modern management, industrial engineering, computer science, and the military. As computer speeds and memory capacity increase, so DES-M&amp;S tools become more powerful and more widely used in solving real-life problems.\n\nBased on over 20 years of evolution within a classroom environment, as well as on decades-long experience in developing simulation-based solutions for high-tech industries, &quot;Modeling and Simulation of Discrete-Event Systems&quot; is the only book on DES-M&amp;S in which all the major DES modeling formalisms - activity-based, process-oriented, state-based, and event-based - are covered in a unified manner: A well-defined procedure for building a formal model in the form of event graph, ACD, or state graph Diverse types of modeling templates and examples that can be used as building blocks for a complex, real-life model A systematic, easy-to-follow procedure combined with sample C# codes for developing simulators in various modeling formalisms Simple tutorials as well as sample model files for using popular off-the-shelf simulators such as SIGMA(r), ACE(r), and Arena(r) Up-to-date research results as well as research issues and directions in DES-M&amp;S\n\n&quot;Modeling and Simulation of Discrete-Event Systems&quot; is an ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate students of simulation/industrial engineering and computer science, as well as for simulation practitioners and researchers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b426283953c8f8ddded17f1dd9bd95ef916f28b","amp;dn":"Modeling+and+Simulation+of+Discrete+Event+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b426283953c8f8ddded17f1dd9bd95ef916f28b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,66,98,131,149,60,143,141,221,237,23,241,221,155,217,94,249,22,242,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
