Yet, long before recent scientific research uncovered this natural linkage, it was described in Kabbalistic healing manuals, with one important difference there it was understood to be a link between the body, mind, and soul of kabbalah and healing.\n\n This healing manual explains Kabbalah's centuries-old perception of human physiology, its view on how to maintain overall health, and how this is dependent on our spiritual well-being.\n\n &quot;The phenomenon of disease is one of [spiritual] separation or estrangement,&quot; the rabbi writes pertaining to kabbalah and healing. When disconnected from our innermost self, and our spiritual Source, illness manifests. Were we to understand the true source of our ailments, and give full expression to our yearning to connect with our life Source, we would have no need for external remedies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a487cc2f9ebb9d647f9382f23fb18af91ee6db","amp;dn":"Body%2C+Mind+and+Soul%3A+Kabbalah+on+Human+Physiology%2C+Disease+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a487cc2f9ebb9d647f9382f23fb18af91ee6db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,164,135,204,47,158,187,157,100,127,147,130,242,63,177,138,249,30,230,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
