It is intended for pilots who have completed VFR RT training and who now wish to expan their knowledge and skills to IFR situations.\n\nThe CBT complies with ICAO IFR RT procedures. Its main purpose is to provide pilots preparing for an Instrument Rating test with practical instruction in IFR RT skills. The CBT also covers the IFR elements of the JAA Communications Syllabus and therefore, will also provide excellent preparation for the JAA ground examinations in IFR RT Communications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb57925b679e8908c82a9c43b5fab35c921020d8","amp;dn":"Oxford+Aviation+IFR+Communications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb57925b679e8908c82a9c43b5fab35c921020d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,87,146,91,103,158,137,8,200,42,156,67,181,250,179,92,146,16,32,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
