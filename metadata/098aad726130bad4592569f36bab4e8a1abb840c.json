All three series (Ultimate Enemy, Ultimate Mystery and Ultimate Doom) are set in the Ultimate Marvel universe, and are written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Rafa Sandoval.\n\nThe series mainly focuses on what remains of the Fantastic Four after Ultimatum, specifically dealing with an unknown threat (revealed later) trying to alter the entire Ultimate Universe, in the process causing a significant amount of destruction. Whilst the previous members of the Fantastic Four remain prominent throughout the series, many other characters from different strands of the Ultimate universe also feature.\n\nThanks goes to Hatful Of Hollow and theProletariat for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
