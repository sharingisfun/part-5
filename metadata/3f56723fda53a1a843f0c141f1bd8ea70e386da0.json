We will start with &quot;classical&quot; astronomy, describing the night sky and organizing what we see as was done in ancient times.\n\nWe will then embark on a journey, starting here on Earth and progressing outward, to study the Solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, and the wonderful and strange objects we observe in deep space, such as black holes, quasars, and supernovae.\n\nWe will end with some discussion of what scientists know today about the universe as a whole.\n\nAlong the way we will introduce some of the methods, theoretical and experimental, that have been used to understand all of this, from Newton's laws, through our understanding of light and matter, to Einstein's theory of relativity, and from Galileo's telescope to WMAP.\n\n== What's Included ==\n\n * Video lectures\n * Presentation slides\n * Corrections\n * Textbook\n * Advanced-level links\n\n== Course Syllabus ==\n\n=== Week 1: Positional Astronomy (naked-eye Astronomy) ===\n\nWe will spend our first week familiarizing ourselves with descriptions of the positions and motions of celestial objects.\n\n=== Week 2: NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Universe ===\n\nNewtonian physics revolutionized the way we understand our Universe. We will discuss NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laws of mechanics, the conservation laws that follow from them, his theory of gravity and some applications to Astronomy, as well as some properties of radiation. The last clip will be a quick look at the features of quantum mechanics relevant to our course. This will be a particularly busy and challenging week, but hard work here will pay off later.\n\n=== Week 3: Planets ===\n\nWe will not have time in this course to do any justice to the broad and exciting field of planetary science. We will spend the week on a general review of the properties and structure of our Solar System and our understanding of its origins and history. We will end with some discussion of the exciting discoveries over the past decade of many hundreds of extrasolar planets.\n\n=== Week 4: Stars ===\n\nWhat we know about stars and a bit about how we found out. We will begin with a quick review of the best-studied star of all, our Sun. We will then talk about classifications; H-R diagrams and main sequence stars; distance, mass, and size measurements; binaries; clusters; and stellar evolution through the main sequence.\n\n=== Week 5: Stellar Evolution ===\n\nEarly and final stages of stellar evolution and stellar remnants. Giants, white dwarves, novae, variable stars, supernovae, neutron stars and pulsars.\n\n=== Week 6: Relativity and Black Holes ===\n\nWe will spend most of this week acquiring an understanding of the special theory of relativity. We will then discuss the general theory in a qualitative way, and discuss its application to black holes, gravitational lensing, and other phenomena of interest.\n\n=== Week 7: Galaxies ===\n\nGalactic structure and classification. Active galactic nuclei, quasars and blazars. Galactic rotation curves and dark matter. Galaxy clusters and large-scale structure.\n\n=== Week 8: Cosmology ===\n\nWhat we can say about the universe as a whole. Hubble Expansion. Big bang cosmology. The cosmic microwave background. Recent determination of cosmological parameters. Early universe physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f56723fda53a1a843f0c141f1bd8ea70e386da0","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Introduction+to+Astronomy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f56723fda53a1a843f0c141f1bd8ea70e386da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,86,114,63,218,83,161,168,67,240,193,65,241,189,142,167,14,56,109,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
