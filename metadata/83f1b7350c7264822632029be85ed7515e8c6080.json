Armed with a handful of lyrics born out of a self-confessed acid trip, Fish came up with the elaborate concept for 1985's Misplaced Childhood. Touching upon his early childhood experiences and his inability to deal with a slew of bad breakups exacerbated by a never-ending series of rock star-type &quot;indulgences&quot;, Misplaced Childhood would prove to be not only the band's most accomplished release to date, but also its most streamlined. Initial record company skepticism over the band's decision to forge ahead with a '70s-style prog rock opus split into two halves (sides one and two) quickly evaporated as Marillion delivered its two most commercial singles ever: &quot;Kayleigh&quot; and &quot;Lavender&quot;. With its lush production and punchy mix, the album went on to become the band's greatest commercial triumph, especially in Europe where they would rise from theater attraction to bona fide stadium royalty. The subsequent U.S. success of &quot;Kayleigh&quot; would also see Marillion returning to the States for a difficult tour as Rush's support act.\n\nIn 1999, EMI/Sanctuary re-released a remastered version of the album, featuring a bonus disc of oddities including live fave &quot;Freaks&quot;, the previously unreleased &quot;Blue Angel&quot;, alternate takes of &quot;Kayleigh&quot; and &quot;Heart of Lothian&quot;, and Misplaced Childhood's actual demos.\n\nTracklist:\nDisc 1:\n01.
