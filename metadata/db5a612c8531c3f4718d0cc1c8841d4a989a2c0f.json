Amjad, â€ŽK.D. Demadis (Elsevier, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nMineral Scales and Deposits: Scientific and Technological Approaches presents, in an integrated way, the problem of scale deposits (precipitation/crystallization of sparingly-soluble salts) in aqueous systems, both industrial and biological.\r\n\r\nIt covers several fundamental aspects, also offering an applicationsâ€™ perspective, with the ultimate goal of helping the reader better understand the underlying mechanisms of scale formation, while also assisting the user/reader to solve scale-related challenges.\r\n\r\nIt is ideal for scientists/experts working in academia, offering a number of crystal growth topics with an emphasis on mechanistic details, prediction modules, and inhibition/dispersion chemistry, amongst others. In addition, technologists, consultants, plant managers, engineers, and designers working in industry will find a field-friendly overview of scale-related challenges and technological options for their mitigation.\r\n\r\nProvides a unique, detailed focus on scale deposits, includes the basic science and mechanisms of scale formation\r\nPresent a field-friendly overview of scale-related challenges and technological options for their mitigation\r\nCorrelates chemical structure to performance\r\nProvides guidelines for easy assessment of a particular case, also including solutions\r\nIncludes an extensive list of industrial case studies for reference","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db5a612c8531c3f4718d0cc1c8841d4a989a2c0f","amp;dn":"Mineral+Scales+and+Deposits+-+Scientific+and+Technological+Appro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db5a612c8531c3f4718d0cc1c8841d4a989a2c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,90,97,44,133,49,195,244,113,141,12,193,200,132,29,74,152,154,44,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
