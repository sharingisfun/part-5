Despite this, it has remained relatively neglected in the literature over the past two decades, during which time much progress has been achieved.\n\nThis is the first atlas on the subject, and it is comprehensive in scope. The state of the art in the use of ultrasound for resection guidance is carefully documented, and new techniques for exploration of the biliary tract and facilitation of transplant surgery are presented. Further important topics include the role of ultrasound in laparoscopic approaches, the use of contrast agents for diagnosis and staging, and developments in the planning of surgical strategy. The editor is a leading authority whose group has been responsible for a variety of advances in the field. He has brought together other experts whose aim throughout is to provide clear information and guidance on the optimal use of ultrasound when performing liver surgery. This atlas is intended especially for hepatobiliary surgeons but will also be of considerable value for general surgeons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8e2b3ab1ea3a718440e1a19c89f448a82b3764a","amp;dn":"Ultrasound-Guided+Liver+Surgery+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8e2b3ab1ea3a718440e1a19c89f448a82b3764a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,226,179,171,30,163,167,24,68,14,26,25,200,159,68,138,130,179,118,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
