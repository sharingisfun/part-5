An album which was for years in the making, it is the translation into tracks of very old ideas and the combination not only of styles, but also of many guest musician's talent. Together with several new singers and musicians, Igorrr has perfected here the concepts he had touched in his previous albums, improving his production and mixing breakcore, baroque classical music and metal in an even faster, more coherent and crazier way. Both from Igorrr solo and from his high-profile guests &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is the lorrrd's concentrate, the exhilarating, mad result of a perfectionist's tireless work.\n\nDescription taken from: http://praxis.c8.com/shop/Igorrr-Hallelujah_detail_4525_14.html (Where you can also buy this as an LP.
