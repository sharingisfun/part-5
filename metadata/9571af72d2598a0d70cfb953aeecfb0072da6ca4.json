Having once again parted ways with original drummer Nick Jago, bassist Robert Levon Been and guitarist Peter Hayes seem to have found a renewed creative spark with replacement drummer Leah Shapiro. Shapiro comes to the fold with strong noise rock credentials, having been a member of the punk-psych N.Y.C.-based Dead Combo and touring with the Raveonettes. With an overall sound that seems inspired by a searing mix of old-timey blues mixed with a hypodermic blast of melodic noise, there is a driving, wild-eyed intensity to many of the tracks on Beat the Devil's Tattoo. From the opening death-ballad title track and the gospel-meets-Madchester &quot;Conscience Killer,&quot; the stoned robot funk of &quot;War Machine,&quot; and the blissed-out acoustic folk ballad &quot;Sweet Feeling,&quot; BRMC are in top form. But if you're looking for gutting-jet-engine lift-off, the cosmically epic, sanguine rock anthem &quot;Bad Blood,&quot; with its repeated chorus of &quot;I can see it in your eyes and now it's gone&quot; is, like the rest of Beat the Devil's Tattoo, likely to grab you by the throat and leave its mark for some time to come. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9571af72d2598a0d70cfb953aeecfb0072da6ca4","amp;dn":"Black+Rebel+Motorcycle+Club...Beat+The+Devil%5C%27s+Tattoo+%282010%29+%5BF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9571af72d2598a0d70cfb953aeecfb0072da6ca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,113,175,114,210,89,138,13,112,207,185,83,174,236,251,0,114,218,108,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
