Most of these books have multiple versions allowing the listener the option to choose their favorite narrator (Whether it is William Gaminara, Fredrick Davidson or Alistair Maydon). \n\nThis torrent is different from the previous version I had uploaded. This torrent offers more variety of readers and several versions of books not found elsewhere (such as William Gaminara's reading of &quot;Sharpe's Waterloo&quot;) .\n\nAs far as I know this is THE ONLY COMPLETE SHARPE COLLECTION offered on the Internet, so I hope you will enjoy it.... :D\n\n\nThis is a very large torrent with 52 books (counting the different versions of each story) so please help seed it.\n\n\n\n\n01 -Sharpe's Tiger (2 Versions) \nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\n\n\n02 - Sharpe's triumph (2 Versions)\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n03 - Sharpe's Fortress (2 Versions)\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n04 - Sharpe's Trafalgar (1 Version)\nRead by William Gaminara\n\n\n05 - Sharpe's Prey (2 Versions)\nRead by Patrick Tull\nRead by William Gaminara\n\n\n06 - Sharpe's Rifles (3 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n07- Sharpe's Havoc (2 Versions)\nRead by Patrick Tull\nRead by William Gaminara\n\n\n08 - Sharpes Eagle (3 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n09 - Sharpe's Gold (3 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n10 - Sharpe's Escape (3 Versions)\nRead by Patrick Tull\nRead by Jonathan Oliver\nRead by William Gaminara\n\n\n11 - Sharpe's Fury (2 Versions)\nRead by Christian Rodska\nRead by Steven Crossley \n\n12 - Sharpe's Battle (3 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n13 - Sharpe's Company (3 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n14 - Sharpe's Sword (3 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n14.5 Sharpe's Skirmish [Short Story] (1 Version)\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n15- Sharpe's Enemy (2 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n16- Sharpe's Honour (1 Version) \nRead by Fredrick Davidson\n\n\n17 - Sharpe's Regiment (1 Version)\nRead by William Gaminara\n\n17.5- Sharpe's Christmas [Short Story] (1 Version)\nRead by Sean Cullen\n\n\n18- Sharpe's Siege (2 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\n\n\n19 - Sharpe's Revenge (2 Versions)\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n\n20 - Sharpe's Waterloo (3 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n21 - Sharpe's Devil (3 Versions)\nRead by Fredrick Davidson\nRead by William Gaminara\nRead by Alistair Maydon\n\n\n22- Sharpes Ransom [Short Story] (2 Versions)\nRead by Jonathan Oliver\nRead by Sean Cullen\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:070264d68e1078c10f3b6d99bc6a596e2eca7bd1","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Sharpe+Collection+-+Bernard+Cornwell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"070264d68e1078c10f3b6d99bc6a596e2eca7bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,2,100,214,142,16,120,193,15,59,109,153,188,106,89,110,46,202,123,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
