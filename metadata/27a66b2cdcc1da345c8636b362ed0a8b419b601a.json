Helmed by The King's Speech's Academy AwardÃ‚Â®-winning director, Tom Hooper, the Working Title/Cameron Mackintosh production stars Hugh Jackman, Oscar winner Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Aaron Tveit, Samantha Barks, with Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. Set against the backdrop of 19th-century France, Les MisÃƒÂ©rables tells an enthralling story of broken dreams and unrequited love, passion, sacrifice and redemption - a timeless testament to the survival of the human spirit. Jackman plays ex-prisoner Jean Valjean, hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman Javert (Crowe) after he breaks parole. When Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's (Hathaway) young daughter, Cosette, their lives change forever. In December 2012, the world's longest-running musical brings its power to the big screen in Tom Hooper's sweeping and spectacular interpretation of Victor Hugo's epic tale. With international superstars and beloved songs including I Dreamed a Dream, Bring Him Home, One Day More and On My Own Les MisÃƒÂ©rables, the show of shows, is now reborn as the cinematic musical experience of a lifetime.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSoundtrack - Les MisÃƒÂ©rables: Highlights from the Motion Picture Soundtrack 2012\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Soundtrack\nAlbum................: Les MisÃƒÂ©rables: Highlights from the Motion Picture Soundtrack 2012\nGenre................: Soundtrack\nSource...............: NMR\nYear.................: 2012\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 50 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/les-miserables-highlights-from-the-motion-picture-soundtrack/25388125\nIncluded.............: NFO, LOG, CUE\nCovers...............: Front \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
