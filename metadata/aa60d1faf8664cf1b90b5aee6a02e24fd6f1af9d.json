In a major restructuring, this edition of the handbook lays the foundations with an up-to-date treatment of lithography, contamination and yield management, and reliability of thin films. The established physical and chemical deposition processes and technologies are then covered, the last section of the book being devoted to more recent technological developments such as microelectromechanical systems, photovoltaic applications, digital cameras, CCD arrays, and optical thin films.\r\n\r\nA practical survey of thin film technologies aimed at engineers and managers involved in all stages of the process: design, fabrication, quality assurance and applications\r\nCovers core processes and applications in the semiconductor industry and new developments in the photovoltaic and optical thin film industries\r\nThe new edition takes covers the transition taking place in the semiconductor world from Al/SiO2 to copper interconnects with low-k dielectrics\r\nWritten by acknowledged industry experts from key companies in the semiconductor industry including Intel and IBM\r\nForeword by Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel and formulator of the renowned â€˜Mooreâ€™s Lawâ€™ relating to the technology development cycle in the semiconductor industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa60d1faf8664cf1b90b5aee6a02e24fd6f1af9d","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Thin+Film+Deposition+-+Techniques%2C+Processes%2C+and+Te","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa60d1faf8664cf1b90b5aee6a02e24fd6f1af9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,96,209,250,248,102,76,241,185,11,90,238,106,2,226,79,214,241,175,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
