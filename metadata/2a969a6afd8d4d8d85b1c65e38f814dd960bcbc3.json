Harlequin Blaze stories sizzle with strong heroines and irresistible heroes playing the game of modern love and lust. They're fun, sexy and always steamy.\n\n\nIsabel Sharpe - Nothing to Hide \n\nYou never know who will end up in your bedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nNYC in the summer is unbearable. So when a former coworker invites Allie McDonald to stay at his family's &quot;summer home&quot; (read: rich manor) for two weeks, how can she say no? She may end up spending most of her time avoiding his not-so-subtle advancesÃ¢â‚¬â€but his ridiculously hot brother, Jonas Meyer, will be there, tooÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. \n\nAnd Jonas has a seriously fine physique. Allie gets a sneak preview one night when she accidentally crawls into his bed and discovers, uhÃ¢â‚¬Â¦wow. Now she's running from one guy while seducing his brother with some super-sexy vintage lingerie and a little inspiration. And with (almost) nothing to hide, Allie also has nothing to lose!\n\n\n\nKate Hoffmann - The Mighty Quinns: Malcolm \n\nHer guide to adventureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦in and out of the bedroom \n\nNew Zealand wilderness guide Malcolm Quinn is stunned to learn that his father's bodyÃ¢â‚¬â€lost near the summit of Everest almost twenty years agoÃ¢â‚¬â€has been found. The discovery stirs up painful memories for Mal, and brings eager reporters out in droves. He is ready to resist them all, until he meets the pretty little Yank who turns his blood to liquid lustÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. \n\nAmy Engalls needs this story to make her career, but Mal refuses to be interviewed. Instead the gorgeous Quinn offers Amy the kind of adventure she'll never forget. She accepts, realizing she may be jeopardizing her future for a short-term fantasy. By breaking the rules, will she lose everythingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦including her heart? \n\n\nNancy Warren - Breakaway \n\nWelcome to Last Bachelor Standing! \n\nHow long can three sexy single men hold out? \n\nOur next bachelor? Mr. Business-Before-Pleasure, Max Varo. He's a genius billionaire with the cojones to go after anything he wantsÃ¢â‚¬â€and win. Now this tempting man is disguised as a &quot;pilot&quot; while he checks out a small Alaskan airline he wants to buy. But he's about to meet his (very sexy) WaterlooÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. \n\nPilot Claire Lundstrom hasn't a clue that her family's struggling business is on the cusp of a takeover. What she does know is that she has some rather unbosslike lusty thoughts for Max. But Claire will have to convince himÃ¢â‚¬â€in the most exquisite ways possibleÃ¢â‚¬â€that losing can be way more fun than winning!\n\n\nTawny Weber - A SEAL's Kiss \n\nSubject: Navy SEAL Petty Officer Aiden Masters \n\nCurrent Status: On leave \n\nObstacle: Deploy &quot;Mission: (Fake) Engagement&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦without actually falling for his fiancÃƒÂ©e! \n\nThe goal of Mission: Engagement is simpleÃ¢â‚¬â€a fake engagement concocted to bring happiness to Sage Taylor's ailing father. \n\nThe Rules: \n\n1) Treat it like a military mission \n\n2) Keep the truth undercover \n\n3) The &quot;engagement&quot; lasts as long as the professor's health depends on it; and \n\n4) No sexÃ¢â‚¬Â¦especially with each other! \n\nBut the incredibly spirited (and a touch quirky) Sage has never been one for rules. Especially when they involve Aiden's rock-hard navy bod and a ton of smokin'-hot sexual attraction. Which means in order to seduce this sexy SEAL, she'll have to completely outmaneuver himÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nFormat: EPUB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a969a6afd8d4d8d85b1c65e38f814dd960bcbc3","amp;dn":"Harlequin+Blaze+April+2014+releases+%28Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a969a6afd8d4d8d85b1c65e38f814dd960bcbc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,150,154,106,253,141,77,141,133,177,198,94,56,248,20,221,150,11,203,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
