It is similar to Mac OS X's Preview.app, but lets you easily browse the entire contents of folders and archives, move and copy image files quickly, and supports many more image formats. It also shows animation for formats which support this.\n\nIt is designed to take full advantage of touch controls, allowing you to swipe through images in a folder one by one. You can of course also zoom and rotate files using multi-touch gestures.\n\nXee can also display huge amounts of metadata from image files. For this, it uses Image::ExifTool, one of the most comprehensive metadata libraries.\n\nLoading images directly from archive files is also possible, and Xee works very well as a comic book reader.\n\nXee offers multiple visual styles. This allows you to, for instance, pick one which is less distracting while sorting through photos.\n\n\n\n## What's New in Version 3.3\n\n\n* Added Share menu option to share images through mail and social networks, and also to add them to iPhoto and Aperture. (Only available on OS X 10.8 and up.)\n* Much improved loading speed for large images.\n* Fixed crashes and graphical distortion on computers running OS X 10.7.\n* Added Style tab in preferences, that allows changing the window and loading styles, as well as changing the background colours.\n\n\nFor more :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/xee3/id639764244?ls=1&amp;mt=12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/xee3/id639764244?ls=1&amp;mt=12&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:663c342d04bd39eb2be868c44861dd7b5adb9931","amp;dn":"Xee+-+3.3++with+%5BKeygen%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"663c342d04bd39eb2be868c44861dd7b5adb9931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,60,52,45,4,189,57,235,43,232,104,196,72,97,221,123,90,219,153,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
