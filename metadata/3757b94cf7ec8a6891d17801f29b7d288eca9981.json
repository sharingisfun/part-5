They released their debut album Choirs of the Eye on John Zorn's Tzadik Records label that year.\nSince then, Kayo Dot's music has undergone several identity shifts, largely influenced by the band's constantly changing lineup and instrumentation. One predominant element of Driver's compositional voice which remains consistent throughout all of Kayo Dot's output, however, is the band's use of abstract timing and performance cues.\nThe band have released six studio albums: Choirs of the Eye in 2003, Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue in 2006, Blue Lambency Downward in 2008, Coyote in 2010, Stained Glass in 2011, and Gamma Knife/Grey Dream in 2012.\n\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Post-Rock/Avant-Garde/Post-Metal/Experimental\nQuality: 320 kbps\nTracklist:\n(2003) Kayo Dot - Choirs of the Eye\n01 - Marathon.mp3\n02 - A Pitcher of Summer.mp3\n03 - The Manifold Curiosity.mp3\n04 - Wayfarer.mp3\n05 - The Antique.mp3\n\n(2006) Kayo Dot Dowsing Anemone With Copper Tongue (Advance)\n01 - Gemini Becoming the Tripod.mp3\n02 - Immortelle and Paper Caravelle.mp3\n03 - Aura on an Asylum Wall.mp3\n04 - __On Limpid Form.mp3\n05 - Amaranth the Peddler.mp3\n\n(2008) Kayo Dot Blue Lambency Downward\n01 - Blue Lambency Downward.mp3\n02 - Clelia Walking.mp3\n03 - Right Hand Is the One I Want.mp3\n04 - The Sow Submits.mp3\n05 - The Awkward Wind Wheel.mp3\n06 - The Useless Ladder.mp3\n07 - Symmetrical Arizona.mp3\n\n(2010) Kayo Dot Coyote\n01 - Calonyction Girl.mp3\n02 - Whisper Ineffable.mp3\n03 - Abyss Hinge 1 Sleeping Birds Sighing in Roscolux.mp3\n04 - Abyss Hinge 2 the Shrinking Armature.mp3\n05 - Cartogram Out of Phase.mp3\n\n(2010) Kayo Dot Stained Glass (EP)\n01 - Stained Glass.mp3\n\n(2012) Kayo Dot Gamma Knife\n01 - Lethe.mp3\n02 - Rite of Goetic Evocation.mp3\n03 - Mirror Water, Lightning Night.mp3\n04 - Ocellated God.mp3\n05 - Gamma Knife.mp3\n\n(2006) - Kayo Dot with Bloody Panda split (Holy Roar, Vinyl 12)\n01 - Don't Touch Dead Animals.mp3\n02 - Fever.mp3\n03 - Circle and Tail.mp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3757b94cf7ec8a6891d17801f29b7d288eca9981","amp;dn":"Kayo+Dot+Discography+%40320+kbps+%5Bre-upload%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3757b94cf7ec8a6891d17801f29b7d288eca9981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,87,185,76,247,236,138,104,145,209,120,1,242,155,125,40,142,202,153,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
