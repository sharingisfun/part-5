This installment of industry expert Deke McClelland's Illustrator One-on-One series starts by showing you how to effectively manage layers, clipping groups, and swatches, so that you can easily swap out colors and content. Deke then explains how to create customized strokes and patterns and build complex gradients with transparency and dynamic effects, and then apply these features to paths, groups, and editable text to create professional-quality artwork. He also highlights some of the most popular features in Illustrator: Live Paint and all ten of its Pathfinder operations. The final chapters show how to prepare your projects for print and save them for distribution on the web.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1ff3435411b65e60e66692f5adcca841c8b5c1a","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Illustrator+CC+One-on-One%3A+Intermediate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1ff3435411b65e60e66692f5adcca841c8b5c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,255,52,53,65,27,101,230,14,102,105,47,90,220,202,132,28,139,92,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
