Healey plays his Stratocaster flat on his lap, allowing him to perform unusual long stretches that give his otherwise fairly predictable music real heart and unpredictability. Throughout the album, his guitar work keeps things interesting, even on slow ballads like &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; (one of two John Hiatt songs, by the way, along with the ripping &quot;Confidence Man&quot;). That's what keeps See the Light interesting, and it's what makes it an intriguing, promising debut. Unfortunately, Healey has never quite fulfilled that promise, but it's still exciting to hear the first flowerings of his talent..\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Confidence Man\n[02] My Little Girl\n[03] River Of No Return\n[04] Don't Let Your Chance Go By\n[05] Angel Eyes\n[06] Nice Problem To Have\n[07] Someday, Someway\n[08] I Need To Be Loved\n[09] Blue Jean Blues\n[10] That's What They Say\n[11] Hideaway\n[12] See The Light\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:49m:43s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 123mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
