Smith\nWiley | April 2013|  ISBN-10: 0470462590 | ePUB | 2567 pages | 15.5 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Marchs-Advanced-Organic-Chemistry-Mechanisms/dp/0470462590&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Marchs-Advanced-Organic-Chemistry-Mechanisms/dp/0470462590&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe new, revised and updated 7th edition of MarchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Advanced Organic Chemistry clearly explains the theories and examples of organic chemistry, providing the most comprehensive resource about organic chemistry available.\nReaders are guided on planning and execution of multi-step synthetic reactions, with detailed descriptions of all the reactions. The first five chapters deal with the structure of organic compounds and discuss important organic chemistry bonds, fundamental principles of conformation, and stereochemistry of organic molecules, and reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. Chapters 6 to 9 are concerned with general principles of mechanism in organic chemistry, including acids and bases, photochemistry, sonochemistry and microwave irradiation, and finally the relationship between structure and reactivity. The last 10 chapters cover the nature and the scope of organic reactions and their mechanisms.\nThe 7th edition proves again it is a must-have desktop reference and textbook for every student and professional working in organic chemistry or related fields.\n\nKey features of the 7th edition:\n-    Every chapter has been updated with the most recent reaction information with references to both the primary and review literature\n-    New to the 7th edition: 5,500 references since the last edition, updates / rewrites of the retained sections, and an updated index in Appendix B\n-    Contains more than 1650 reactions and 20,000 valuable references to the primary literature\n-    Includes appendices on the literature of organic chemistry and the classification of reactions according to the compounds synthesized\n-    Guides the reader on planning and execution of multi-step synthetic reactions, with detailed descriptions of all the reactions.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface\nCommon Abbreviations\nBiographical Statement\n\nPart I: \nChapter 1: Localized Chemical Bonding\nChapter 2: Delocalized Chemical Bonding\nChapter 3: Bonding Weaker Than Covalent\nChapter 4: Stereochemistry and Conformation\nChapter 5: Carbocations, Carbanions, Free Radicals, Carbenes, and Nitrenes\nChapter 6: Mechanisms and Methods of Determining Them\nChapter 7: Irradiation Processes in Organic Chemistry\nChapter 8: Acids and Bases\nChapter 9: Effects of Structure and Medium on Reactivity\n\nPart II: \nChapter 10: Aliphatic Substitution, Nucleophilic and Organometallic\nChapter 11: Aromatic Substitution, Electrophilic\nChapter 12: Aliphatic, Alkenyl, and Alkynyl Substitution, Electrophilic and Organometallic\nChapter 13: Aromatic Substitution: Nucleophilic and Organometallic\nChapter 14: Substitution Reactions: Radical\nChapter 15: Addition to CarbonÃ¢â‚¬â€œCarbon Multiple Bonds\nChapter 16: Addition to CarbonÃ¢â‚¬â€œHetero Multiple Bonds\nChapter 17: Eliminations\nChapter 18: Rearrangements\nChapter 19: Oxidations and Reductions\nAppendix A: The Literature of Organic Chemistry\nAppendix B: Classification of Reactions by Type of Compounds Synthesized\n\nIndexes\nAuthor Index\nSubject Index","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb81ec950e2451eb125471dec2e7624e9ef0147","amp;dn":"March%27s+Advanced+Organic+Chemistry+%287th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb81ec950e2451eb125471dec2e7624e9ef0147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,184,30,201,80,226,69,30,177,37,71,29,236,46,118,36,233,239,1,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
