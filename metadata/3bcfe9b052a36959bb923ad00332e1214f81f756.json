It includes every episode broadcast in the XL (uncut) format, which began with Series 6 (F) episode 3. Every episode from the beginning of Series 8 (H) is in 720p HD, with the exception of six episodes: 8-9 XL House and Home, 8-13 XL Holidays, 9-12 XL Illumination, 9-17 XL Immortal Bard, 10-14 XL Jingle Bells, and 10-18 XL Just the Job. *PLEASE* upload these if you have the XL version in 720p, and leave a comment here (if you live in the UK, please keep a lookout for the missing XL 720p episodes on Dave HD). I have also included my full 70 minute recording of the Comic Relief Special (for Red Nose Day) as Episode 8-19, Genesis (Making of QI) as Episode 9-0, and Sport Relief as Episode 9-19.\n\nThis upload complements thepiratebay.se/torrent/6161914, which is a wonderful compilation of Series 1-8. However, that upload does not have any 720p content, it is missing episode 7-15, and it does not have the XL versions of 6-3, 6-4, 6-5, 6-6, 6-8, 7-2, 7-3, 7-15 or 7-16. Although it duplicates part of torrent 6161914, I have included Series 6-8 in my upload so there is a full set of XL episodes available, and almost all of the XL 720p broadcasts.\n\nMost of this material comes from web-rips from many different sources made at the time of the original broadcasts, with some recordings of my own. I apologise to the original uploaders for not having kept a record of their online identities. I have used the Wikipedia episode names and numbers. Series 6-7 (F-G) are AVI files with 25 fps XviD video that is mostly 640x360, and 2-channel mp3 audio at 128 kbps. Series 8-10 (H-J) are MKV files with 25 fps AVC video that is almost all 1280x720, and 2-channel AC3 audio at 128 kbps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bcfe9b052a36959bb923ad00332e1214f81f756","amp;dn":"QI+Season+Series+6+7+8+9+10+%28F+G+H+I+J%29+XL+UNCUT+HD+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bcfe9b052a36959bb923ad00332e1214f81f756","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,207,233,176,82,163,105,89,187,146,58,208,3,50,225,33,79,129,247,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
