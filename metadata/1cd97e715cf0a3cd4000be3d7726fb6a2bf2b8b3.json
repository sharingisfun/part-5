John Lasseter \nand Ed Catmull used these cartoons the way Walt Disney \nused the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; during the 1930s: as a training \nground for artists and a way to explore the potential of a \nnew medium. Although it's only 90 seconds long, &quot;Luxo, Jr.&quot; \n(1986) ranks as the &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; of computer animation: \nFor the first time, audiences believed CG characters could \nthink and feel. (It was also the first CG film to make \naudiences laugh.) When the artists began work on Toy Story, \nthey had learned so much from the shorts, they were ready to \nundertake that landmark creation. In the later shorts, the \nviewer can see the artists continuing to experiment: with a \nmore realistic human figure in &quot;Geri's Game&quot; and with new \nways of suggesting atmospheric effects in &quot;Boundin'.&quot; Some \nof the more recent shorts continue the adventures of the \ncharacters from the features. &quot;Jack-Jack Attack&quot; reveals \nwhat happened to the hapless baby-sitter while the \nIncredibles were off fighting Syndrome, while &quot;Mater and \nthe Ghost Light&quot; shows that life goes on for the inhabitants \nof Radiator Springs. \n\nA delightful collection of entertaining shorts, and a \nsignificant chronicle of the growth of computer animation.\n\nGENERAL INFO:\n\nContainers......: mkv\nVideo...........: 720x400 or 640x480 (x264, 650 kbps)\nAudio...........: 2.0 channels (128 kbps, aac)\nSoft-coded Subs.: English (VobSub)\nFrame Rate......: 25,00 fps \nSource..........: DVD (PAL)\n\nList of the included short films:\n\n01 - The Adventures of Andre and Wally B.
