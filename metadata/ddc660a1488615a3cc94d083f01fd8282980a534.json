The five ex-public schoolboys that make up Oxford's Foals are hardly lacking self-confidence--comically cocky frontman Yannis Phillipakis could annoy for the nation and the band rejected producer David Sitek's original mix--but Antidotes is anything but pony. After spending their youth in rigorous &quot;math rock&quot; outfits, Foals started out in 2005 with the stated intention of having fun. Rather delightfully, this amounted to the discovery that audiences are well disposed to acts they can dance to. A clutch of well-received singles and a guest spot on popular sixth-form satire Skins sealed their popularity. Their origins in academic rock are sometimes obvious, but fine drummer Jack Bevan keeps things moving throughout. Opener &quot;The French Open&quot;, with its gleeful chanted vocals (in French) and fashionable Afrobeat tinged guitar lines, evokes Talking Heads' dada nonsense classic &quot;I Zimbra&quot;, itself older than any Foal. First top thirty hit &quot;Cassius&quot; saw jazz-punk back in the charts for the first time since that perennial football crowd favourite &quot;Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag&quot;. &quot;Olympic Airways&quot; is a charming if oblique tale of escape that couldn't be further from the bus stop/chip shop style while &quot;Red Socks Pugie&quot; already sounds like a single in waiting. The lyrics might charitably be described as impressionistic and Phillipakis's voice remains nondescript. But with better tunes than Bloc Party and a self-conscious precision that recalls Mogwai in their pomp, the effortlessly pretentious Foals are unmistakably the sound of 2008. --Steve Jelbert","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc660a1488615a3cc94d083f01fd8282980a534","amp;dn":"Foals+-+Antidote+%5B2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc660a1488615a3cc94d083f01fd8282980a534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,198,96,161,72,134,21,163,204,148,208,131,240,31,216,40,41,128,165,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
