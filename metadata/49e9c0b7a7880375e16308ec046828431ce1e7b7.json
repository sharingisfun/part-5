Shine Like Stars\n\n\nThis is it, the album where psychedelia, techno and blues rock all blend together in one blissful mix. With one foot in Beggars Banquet-era Stones (the gospel-rock Movin' on Up) and the other in the trippy soundscapes of rave culture (the Orb-produced Higher Than the Sun), Primal Scream caught the mind-blown euphoria of Ecstacy better than anyone. Released 20 years ago, it doesn't sound horribly dated, partly due to Andy Weatherall's incredible production. Screamadelica is a modern classic, and one of my all time favourites.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 59\nArtist: Primal Scream\nAlbum: Screamadelica\nYear: 1991\nGenre: Alternative\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49e9c0b7a7880375e16308ec046828431ce1e7b7","amp;dn":"Primal+Scream+-+Screamadelica+%5BFLAC-1991%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49e9c0b7a7880375e16308ec046828431ce1e7b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,233,192,183,167,136,3,117,225,99,8,236,4,104,40,67,28,225,231,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
