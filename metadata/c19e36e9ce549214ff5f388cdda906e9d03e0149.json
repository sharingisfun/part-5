Based on the wildly popular comic book series Hellblazer from DC Comics, seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine is armed with a ferocious knowledge of the dark arts and a wickedly naughty wit. He fights the good fight - or at least he did. With his soul already damned to hell, he's decided to abandon his campaign against evil until a series of events thrusts him back into the fray when an old friend's daughter becomes the target of supernatural forces.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c19e36e9ce549214ff5f388cdda906e9d03e0149","amp;dn":"Constantine.S01E12.1080p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c19e36e9ce549214ff5f388cdda906e9d03e0149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,158,54,233,206,84,146,20,255,95,56,140,221,169,6,233,208,62,1,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
