Players control their own Sims in activities and relationships in a similar manner to real life. The gameplay is open-ended and indefinite. Sim houses and neighborhoods are entirely in one continuous map. The developers stated, &quot;What you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within.&quot; One of the biggest changes to the franchise is the use of rabbit-holes. Sims aren't allowed to go inside the majority of city buildings; instead, they simply disappear inside for a certain amount of timeÃ¢â‚¬â€a feature known in video games as a rabbit-hole[citation needed]Ã¢â‚¬â€while the player is given several choices on what happens inside using a text-based notification.\n\nUpdate Includes\n\nSupernatural\n\nInstall Notes\n\n-Unrar\n-Install update, copy over cracked files to the GameBin subdir of where you installed The Sims 3.\n-Enjoy\n\nRelease Notes\n\nDon't allow the launcher to download &amp; install updates, don't go online and don't try to login when the game asks you to.
