I have converted it into a handy mkv file. I think this was originally recorded onto a DVD-R from Swiss TV, hence the [b]French hard-subtitles[/b]. I have included synchronised [b]srt subtitles in English, German, Spanish and French[/b](slightly different translation to the French hard-subs). [b]To cover over the hard-subs with the srt-subs set your media player to give subtitles an opaque background.[/b] These subtitles were originally ripped from another production of Parsifal and then laboriously synchronised to this production.\n\nSome Tech'\nThe recorded video was converted to an mkv (H.264  at 22.25 [RF]quality) and  \nstereo AC3 audio was passed through.\n\nI hope you enjoy.\n\nmeXme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:014bd2b342b9f4bf17bd37d8d87d66744938d060","amp;dn":"Parsifal+-+Richard+Wagner+-+Barenboim+-+Kupfer+-+Elming+-+Meier+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"014bd2b342b9f4bf17bd37d8d87d66744938d060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,75,210,179,66,185,244,191,23,189,55,216,216,125,102,116,73,56,208,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
