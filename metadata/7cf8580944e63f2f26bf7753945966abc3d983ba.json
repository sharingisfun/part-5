But some words matter most of all: verbs. Verbs are the catalysts of sentences. They bring communication to life - whether it's written or spoken. The right 'power verbs' make all your interactions and advice more memorable, impactful, and dynamic. They make you more inspiring, more effective, more successful in everything you do, from building teams to leading projects. Conversely, if you rely on dull and uninteresting verbs, your guidance and directions will fall flat - and so will your career.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cf8580944e63f2f26bf7753945966abc3d983ba","amp;dn":"Power+Verbs+for+Managers..by+by+Michael+L.+Faulkner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cf8580944e63f2f26bf7753945966abc3d983ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,248,88,9,68,230,63,47,38,191,119,83,148,89,102,171,195,217,131,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
