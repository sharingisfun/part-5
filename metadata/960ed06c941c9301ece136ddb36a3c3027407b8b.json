But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, \nand the tree gave and gave and gave.\n\nThis is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation. Shel Silverstein has created a moving parable for readers of all ages that offers an affecting interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Inspirational | Academic | Classics | Fantasy | Philosophy | Short Stories","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:960ed06c941c9301ece136ddb36a3c3027407b8b","amp;dn":"Shel+Silverstein+-+The+Giving+Tree+%5BPDF%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"960ed06c941c9301ece136ddb36a3c3027407b8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,14,208,108,148,28,147,1,236,225,54,221,179,106,60,48,39,64,123,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
