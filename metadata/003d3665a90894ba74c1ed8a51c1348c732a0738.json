Releasing a teaser clip for the new album, Philm have let slip just a small peek at the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monstrous temperament, incendiary guitar and LombardoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unforgivingly aggressive signature drumming.\n\nSet for release on the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new label UDR on 15th September, the band seem to be welcome partners to the label.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“UDR is honoured to be working with Philm. This partnership seems very instinctual,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said UDRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head of A&amp;R/Marketing, Jay Lansford. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dave Lombardo and I worked together during the Grip Inc. years.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He adds, Ã¢â‚¬ËœAfter hearing PhilmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new album this alliance was clearly divine will. Powerful, intenseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ urgent.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ These three prolific musicians have created something that is refreshingly not mundane, but ear-shattering and ground-breakingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLed by the title track single Ã¢â‚¬ËœFire From The Evening SunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, drummer Dave Lombardo explained that the upcoming LP marks a turning point for the band.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“PhilmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album, Harmonic, is still an amazing work to me. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s improvisational &amp; raw. It was my first time producing an album and I am very proud of it. The new album is a completely different animal. It is again produced by me, but mastered &amp; mixed by a couple of musical giantsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Tyler Bates &amp; Robert Carranza. I believe this album has a daring, callous temperament about it that really sums up our mindset right now. No improvising, no fluff. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heavy and in your face from start to finish. You may think you know what Philm is, but you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. If you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen us live, you have no idea. We thrive on being out of our comfort zones and want fans to take that ride.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPhilm are set to head out on tour this autumn to support the release with a number of shows throughout the US and Europe already confirmed and several more expected to be announced.\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
