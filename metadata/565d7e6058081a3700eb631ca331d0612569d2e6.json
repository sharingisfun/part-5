I always make sure to seed my torrents to at least 6:1, often more (some are at 15:1+). But seeing torrents that originally had a lot of leechers are almost dead after a couple of weeks (I'm the only seeder left) just makes me sad. It limits my possibility to download and then upload new stuff here since a lot of my bandwidth goes to seeding those torrents. And it prevents people from downloading the stuff since I cannot always be there to seed.\n\nFor a better experience for you and others - please seed when you're done!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:565d7e6058081a3700eb631ca331d0612569d2e6","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+New+Morning+%28Remastered%29+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"565d7e6058081a3700eb631ca331d0612569d2e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,93,126,96,88,8,26,55,0,235,99,28,163,49,208,97,37,105,210,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
