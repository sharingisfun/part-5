The most famous &quot;acting&quot; Jack Russells of recent years (Moose, who played &quot;Eddie&quot; in the TV show Frasier and Moose's son, Enzo, who was the title character in My Dog Skip) were both owned and trained by the same professional animal trainer, Mathilde de Cagny, who owns and trains Cosmo, the dog playing Arthur. \n\nBoth Ewan McGregor and Christopher Plummer have played Iago in stage productions of 'William Shakespeare''s 'Othello'. \n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/bUg8l.png[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ntANg.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/txr1O.png[/IMG]\n\nBeginners (2010) BRRIP 720p_sujaidr\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nZdCe.png[/IMG]\n\n\nvideo details\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6c24050b042c2058425d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 5 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 44mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 683 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 688 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.860\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.032\nWriting library                  : x264 core 116 r2074 2641b9e\nEncoding settings                : cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:-1:-1 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=umh / subme=9 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=24 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=2 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=16 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=2 / b_bias=0 / direct=3 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=23 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=45 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=683 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\nLanguage                         : English\nDefault                          : Yes\nForced                           : No\n\n\naudio details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 1h 44mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nDefault                          : Yes\nForced                           : No\n\n\nsubs                             english\n\n\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\nthanks to ARNT\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jHcjQ.png[/IMG]\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UzVN6.png[/IMG]\n\nPLOT:It's 2003. Thirty-eight year old graphic artist Oliver Fields has just lost his father Hal Fields to cancer, after Oliver's mother Georgia Fields passed away five years earlier. Oliver is naturally a sullen man due to his growing up relationship with his parents (his mother who had a unique view on life) and watching his parents' cordial but somewhat distant relationship with each other, but is more so now because of his personal family loss. Oliver embarks on a relationship with Anna, a French actress. Oliver is hoping that his re-energized relationship with Hal following Georgia's death and Hal's new outlook on life during that time will show Oliver how to act in a loving relationship. After Georgia's death, Hal came out of the closet and began to live with a joie de vivre that did not exist before, which included an open relationship with a much younger man named Andy... \n\n\nDirector: Mike Mills\n\nStars:                         Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer and MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lanie Laurent\nimdb:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1532503/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1532503/&lt;/a&gt;    \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/7Byof.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/7Byof.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/Rdvpk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/Rdvpk.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/HBiFE.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/HBiFE.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/Ev0Fv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/Ev0Fv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\nTORRENT STAts\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/58c3/97e43879.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/58c3/97e43879.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f32f9da47822b6b6d8858c3b9b1a264bf42ea23","amp;dn":"Beginners+%282010%29+BRRIP+720p_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f32f9da47822b6b6d8858c3b9b1a264bf42ea23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,50,249,218,71,130,43,107,109,136,88,195,185,177,162,100,191,66,234,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
