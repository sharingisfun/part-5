Kevin is obsessed with finding a girl who can help him forget his unpleasant past. However, all his encounters with the opposite sex inevitably go afoul, creating more awkward experiences than he can cope with. As the rejections mount, Kevin's futile search for happiness and love becomes overwhelmingly turbulent, forcing him to take desperate measures. Shot in a variety of NYC locales, from Hell's Kitchen to Greenpoint, Forgetting the Girl is a gritty vision of the city and its denizens. The tightly-woven drama blends recollections with reality to craft an intense character study of the psychologically-scarred protagonist. As beautiful as it is dark, the tense narrative slowly boils under the surface until it unleashes an unsettling climax that will not be easily forgotten.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53baf51bbfbdc.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53baf51bbfbdc.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53baf51c02336.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53baf51c02336.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53baf51c382e2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53baf51c382e2.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2492b12def0f4668d473f3a3b2fc78931a4c53c6","amp;dn":"Forgetting+the+Girl+%282012%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2492b12def0f4668d473f3a3b2fc78931a4c53c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,146,177,45,239,15,70,104,212,115,243,163,178,252,120,147,26,76,83,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
