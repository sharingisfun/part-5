This UNDUB has\n  the USA english text with the original Japanese spoken dialog. \n  \n  Enjoy this game the way it was meant to be played!\n  \n                    -- Release Notes --\n  \n  Well here it is, finally, 5 years late.  I did most of the work\n  right after finishing the GL3 UNDUB ... then got lazy.  After\n  working on GL4 recently I figured I'd better finish fixing this\n  game while the details were fresh again.  After all, it would\n  be a shame to leave things incomplete.\n  \n  I've complained about hatchet jobs before, but this game really\n  remindes me what total douchebags Working Designs were.  Their\n  incompetence is on display even at the assembly level; I had to\n  strip out their repetitious obviously cut&amp;pasted code fucking\n  up the original voice handling.\n\n  Then their horrible &quot;translation&quot; recalls the dark ages of\n  anime localization.  Frequent pointless dialog inflation and\n  rewritten conversations are very irritating.  Makes one wonder\n  if their translator actually understood the original text...\n\n  Anyway, despite all that GL2 is better than I expected. :)\n  \n  Event and battle voices are now Japanese.  You'll have to put\n  up with some mismatches caused by WD's retarded script.\n  \n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n  \n                   *** USA PUBLISHERS ***\n  \n  Please stop ruining your games with such horrible english dubs!\n  We are forced to go to extremes like this because you are making\n  the games we love unplayable!\n  \n  Seriously, your customers expect dual-audio releases.  What is\n  wrong with you?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dcddbd65cc0bbb86541a725797c5f2aeff6940f","amp;dn":"Growlanser+2+The+Sense+Of+Justice+USA+UNDUB+PS2DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dcddbd65cc0bbb86541a725797c5f2aeff6940f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,205,219,214,92,192,187,184,101,65,167,37,121,124,95,42,239,246,148,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
