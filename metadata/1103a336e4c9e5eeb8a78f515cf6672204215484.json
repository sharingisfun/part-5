The song stayed there for nine weeks. Al Martino has stated that Mario Lanza dropped his plans to record this song after he called Lanza in Los Angeles and explained that his own recording would be neglected if he did so.\n\nOne of the most successful Martino hits was &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;, achieving several gold and platinum discs for sales. Recorded in 1965, the song reached number 5 on the UK Singles Chart when re-issued in 1973. Even today, this classic by composer, Bert Kaempfert (his original title for the song was &quot;Moon Over Naples&quot;) is among the 50 most-played songs worldwide. Another hit was &quot;Volare&quot;, (also known as &quot;Nel blu, Dipinto di Blu&quot;). In 1976, it reached number one on the Italian and Flemish charts, and was in the Top Ten in Spain, The Netherlands and France, as well as in many other European countries.\n\nIn the U.S., Martino had eleven top 40 hits in the Billboard pop singles chart in the 1960s and 1970s, with 1963&amp;#039;s &quot;I Love You Because&quot; and 1964&amp;#039;s &quot;I Love You More and More Every Day&quot; both reaching the Top Ten. He also sung the title song for the film, Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), and is credited in the end titles of the film.\n\nApart from singing, Martino played the role of Johnny Fontane in the 1972 film The Godfather, as well as singing the film&amp;#039;s theme, &quot;Speak Softly Love&quot;. He played the same role in The Godfather Part III and The Godfather Trilogy: 1901-1980. He recently returned to acting, playing aging crooner Sal Stevens in the short film Cutout, appearing in film festivals around the world in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01 - I Love You Because\n02 - Bouquet Of Roses\n03 - I Really Don&amp;#039;t Want To Know\n04 - Lonely Drifter\n05 - It&amp;#039;s A Sin\n06 - Losing You\n07 - Still\n08 - If I Never Get To Heaven\n09 - You Win Again\n10 - Merry-Go-Round\n11 - Just Call Me Lonesome\n12 - Take These Chains From My Heart\n\n\n\nAl Martino _ We Could  (1965)\n\n\n\n01 - We Could\n02 - I Won&amp;#039;t Forget You\n03 - You Don&amp;#039;t Know Me\n04 - Jealous Heart\n05 - My Darling, I Love You\n06 - Sunrise To Sunrise\n07 - Always Together\n08 - Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\n09 - Less Than Tomorrow\n10 - Dear Heart\n11 - I Don&amp;#039;t Want To See Tomorrow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1103a336e4c9e5eeb8a78f515cf6672204215484","amp;dn":"Al+Martino+-+I+Love+You+Because++%281963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1103a336e4c9e5eeb8a78f515cf6672204215484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,3,163,54,228,201,229,238,184,167,143,81,92,246,103,34,4,33,84,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
