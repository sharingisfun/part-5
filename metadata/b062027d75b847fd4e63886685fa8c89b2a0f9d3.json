By the end of the seventeenth century, however, the analytic focus of optics had shifted to light: its fundamental properties and such physical behaviors as reflection, refraction, and diffraction. This dramatic shiftÃ¢â‚¬â€which A. Mark Smith characterizes as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Keplerian turnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€lies at the heart of this fascinating and pioneering study.\n\nBreaking from previous scholarship that sees Johannes Kepler as the culmination of a long-evolving optical tradition that traced back to Greek antiquity via the Muslim Middle Ages, Smith presents Kepler instead as marking a rupture with this tradition, arguing that his theory of retinal imaging, which was published in 1604, was instrumental in prompting the turn from sight to light. KeplerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new theory of sight, Smith reveals, thus takes on true historical significance: by treating the eye as a mere light-focusing device rather than an image-producing instrumentÃ¢â‚¬â€as traditionally understoodÃ¢â‚¬â€KeplerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account of retinal imaging helped spur the shift in analytic focus that eventually led to modern optics.\n\nA sweeping survey, From Sight to Light is poised to become the standard reference for historians of optics as well as those interested more broadly in the history of science, the history of art, and cultural and intellectual history.\n\nPublisher: University Of Chicago Press (December 12, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 022617476X\nISBN-13: 978-0226174761\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“From Sight to Light is an exciting and valuable addition to the diachronic history of science in an area of crucial importance not only to our understanding of medieval science but also to the formation of modern science itself. This is history of science at its best.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n(William R. Newman, Indiana University)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In its text-based approach, From Sight to Light offers a convincing conceptual history of optics. Well argued and based on a lifetime of close study of the primary sources, it deserves to be widely read. From Sight to Light has the potential to be a classic alongside David Lindberg's Theories of Vision.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n(Sven DuprÃƒÂ©, Max Planck Institute for the History of Science)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“No one doubts KeplerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contribution to optics and vision. But here, as never before, his ancient and medieval debts are set in deeper historical context, and importantly, his dramatic departures are carefully reassessed and critically revised. SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fresh interpretation of the Western optical traditionÃ¢â‚¬â€impressive in scope and rigor, and written with remarkable clarityÃ¢â‚¬â€will likely become a classic.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n(Robert Alan Hatch, University of Florida)\n\nAbout the Author\nA.
