This is every studio album by the Beach Boys, including That's Why God Made the Radio, in FLAC. These are all from What.CD and Rutracker. I've kept most of it as-is (with scans, cues, and logs) except for some tag and artwork changes. Almost all the art comes from Album Art Exchange. Most covers are 1000x1000 or 1500x1500. I tried getting the highest quality artwork, but some albums don't have any higher resolutions than like 500x500 (though that's only around two albums I think).\nMost of these are straight from the Japan Past Masters collection. A few are from other remastered CD releases (NOT the HDCDs) or original records. Pet Sounds is a 24/96 vinyl rip and Smile is 24/88 from HDTracks. Everything else is 16/44.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff6b0d0b4c2bd384c44d8753bfe537a427773ce","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+Discography+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff6b0d0b4c2bd384c44d8753bfe537a427773ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,246,176,208,180,194,189,56,76,68,216,117,59,254,83,122,66,119,115,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
