The vocals are further back, buried in the thick, heavy electric mix -- some of this music here is Southern electric blues sounding about the way it might when the apocalypse is just around the corner. Forget the fancy stuff, the polished edges, the studio touches -- there are no second takes, no overdubs, no last chances. It's terrifyingly compelling at times. Junior Kimbrough plays the blues with a raw edge, and it's brilliant, dark and mesmerizing -- and it's on CD, with nothing buried, nothing hidden, and nothing safe, all the sharp edges intact. ~ \n\nTracklist\n1.Sad Days, Lonely Nights \n2.Lonsesome in My Home \n3.Lord, Have Mercy on Me \n4.Crawling King Snake \n5.My Mind Is Rumbling \n6.Leaving in the Morning \n7.Old Black Mattie \n8.I'm in Love \n9.Pull Your Clothes Off \n10.I'm Gonna Have to Leave Here \n11.Sad Days, Lonely Nights\n\nPersonnel: Junior Kimbrough (vocals, guitar); Kenny Brown (guitar, slide guitar); Cedrick Jackson (drums).
