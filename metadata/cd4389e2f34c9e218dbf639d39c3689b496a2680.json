His magnificent new biography of Ludwig van Beethoven peels away layers of legend to get to the living, breathing human being who composed some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most iconic music. Swafford mines sources never before used in English-language biographies to reanimate the revolutionary ferment of Enlightenment-era Bonn, where Beethoven grew up and imbibed the ideas that would shape all of his future work. Swafford then tracks his subject to Vienna, capital of European music, where Beethoven built his career in the face of critical incomprehension, crippling ill health, romantic rejection, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“fateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hammer,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his ever-encroaching deafness. Throughout, Swafford offers insightful readings of BeethovenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key works.\n\nMore than a decade in the making, this will be the standard Beethoven biography for years to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd4389e2f34c9e218dbf639d39c3689b496a2680","amp;dn":"Beethoven+Anguish+and+Triumph+%28Jan+Swafford%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd4389e2f34c9e218dbf639d39c3689b496a2680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,67,137,226,243,76,158,33,141,191,99,157,57,195,104,155,73,106,38,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
