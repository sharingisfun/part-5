Ã¢â‚¬Å“CandyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ exhibits Wake Owl primary member and singerColyn CameronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growth as a songwriter and pursuit of experimentation with different instrumentation. Working together with multi-instrumentalist Aiden Briscall and Swift, the result is the upbeat atmospheric vibe found throughout the album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot more room in this batch of songs to explore live,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Cameron. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This was a goal of ours from the outset of writing, trying to create space, so that live we could take people on more of a journey. The music is very visual for us, so there will be a strong visual element in the live set.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5488a4b51feb6ac9a5a06a936692d76a24e8a048","amp;dn":"Wake+Owl+-+The+Private+World+of+Paradise+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5488a4b51feb6ac9a5a06a936692d76a24e8a048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,136,164,181,31,235,106,201,165,160,106,147,102,146,215,106,36,232,160,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
