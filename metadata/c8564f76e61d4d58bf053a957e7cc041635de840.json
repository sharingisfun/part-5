A limited run of 150 CDs were sold at a concert by the group in the UK in 1997. Virgin soon announced that the album would be available for general release in early 1998, but legal issues with the film studio stopped the release. In 1999, Tangerine DreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own record label sold 300 copies of the Millennium Booster album set that included The Keep with a different cover.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8564f76e61d4d58bf053a957e7cc041635de840","amp;dn":"Tangerine+Dream+-+The+Keep+Ultimate+Edition+%282001%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8564f76e61d4d58bf053a957e7cc041635de840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,86,79,118,230,29,77,88,191,5,58,149,126,124,192,65,99,93,232,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
