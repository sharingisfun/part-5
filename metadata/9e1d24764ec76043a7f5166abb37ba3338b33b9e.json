Snaporaz (Marcello Mastroianni) is traveling in a compartment on a train when he lapses into sleep and dreams the ensuing story. He follows a woman off the train and through a field and then loses her. Soon, as a representative of the male sex in general he finds himself in a hotel, among myriad women attending a feminist conference. Surreal episodes take him through a villa with his alter-ego Dr. Katzone (Ettore Manni, who died during filming) and references to his sexual exploits. Reunited with his former wife for a moment, he starts another sequence which reviews his past.\n\nFile Name .........................................: La citta delle donne.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,657,706,496 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:19:18\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x384 (AR: 1.833)\nFPS .................................................: 24.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1449 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.223 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080539/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080539/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nItalian audio; English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by EceAyhan, whom we thank\n\nFederico Fellini - La citta delle donne (1980)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e1d24764ec76043a7f5166abb37ba3338b33b9e","amp;dn":"Federico+Fellini+-+La+citta+delle+donne+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e1d24764ec76043a7f5166abb37ba3338b33b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,29,36,118,78,199,96,67,167,245,22,106,187,55,186,51,56,179,59,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
