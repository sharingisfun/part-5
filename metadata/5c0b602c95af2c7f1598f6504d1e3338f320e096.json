Gradius V preserves the franchise's classic gameplay and features stunning 3D graphics, inspired game design elements and a new control scheme that gives players more power than ever. Gradius V offers the choice of four different weapon configs prior to takeoff. All load-outs include basics like speed-up, laser and multiples. The big differences come in how each config treats its multiples. For example, the first load-out plays just like traditional Gradius games; the options merely follow the ship's movement. A new twist comes in the R1 button, which makes each config's options do something different. Also features music composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto (FF Tactics, Vagrant Story, Ogre Battle, and Radiant Silvergun).\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
