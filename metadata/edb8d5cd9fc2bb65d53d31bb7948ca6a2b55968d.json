I play that song to bring hope that I'll see him again. Some of my other favorites are not only &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot; but also &quot;Won't You Come Back&quot;, &quot;Monday Morning Blues&quot;,&quot;All This I Should Have Known&quot; - heck virtually the entire album!\n\nOn another note, I have a lot of my friends who did not grow up here when they were younger, so I always have to play what they missed during the 80s (I'm grew up here in the US). While they are familiar with Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Prince, Breathe is not well known in my social circles. However, I only need to play the 2 most popular songs &quot;Hands To Heaven&quot; and &quot;How Can I Fall&quot; to for them to fall in love with the group. You can tell when songs are timeless when a person who has never heard them instantly become fans nearly 20 years after they are released!\n\n\nimage\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBreathe - All That Jazz\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Breathe\nAlbum................: All That Jazz\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1987\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 63 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
