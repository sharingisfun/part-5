Following appearances on a series of compilations, Mogwai returned later in the year with the 7&quot; &quot;Summer&quot;; after another early-1997 single, &quot;New Paths to Helicon,&quot; they issued Ten Rapid, a collection of their earliest material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f501dc5f0329b43c7c4db8a74d1c05ae216feb","amp;dn":"Mogwai+-+Rave+Tapes+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f501dc5f0329b43c7c4db8a74d1c05ae216feb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,245,1,220,95,3,41,180,60,124,77,184,167,77,28,5,174,33,111,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
