The arrival of an attractive new girl in his school and neighborhood proves a mixed blessing: Maggie becomes his best friend\nand companion, admiring his many talents, but inevitably she soon falls for Cappie the other way, so now his 'big brother' and protector seems little Lucas's rival, however hard the hunk tries to stay friends...\n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nShe was the biggest thing that ever hit him until he played football. It's about falling in love. For the first time. There's nothing wrong with being different. A boy that just won't be beaten.\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK. I MIGHT HAVE WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR. YOU NEVER KNOW IT NEVER HURTS TO ASK.\n\n\nCOREY HAIM  REST IN PEACE  12/23/71 - 3/10/10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f8f7094a2c4ce65f284ea3658feb5769aafce83","amp;dn":"Lucas+1986+DvDrip%5BEng%5D-greenbud1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f8f7094a2c4ce65f284ea3658feb5769aafce83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,143,112,148,162,196,206,101,242,132,234,54,88,254,181,118,154,175,206,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
