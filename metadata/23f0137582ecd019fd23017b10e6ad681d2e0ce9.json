At the moment, there is no known method to extract the password from the compressed\nfile; so the only available methods are \\&quot;brute force\\&quot; and dictionary-based attacks. Here is a brief\nlist of ARPR\\&amp;#039;s advantages:\n\n* ARPR has a convenient and easy to use user interface;\n* ARPR works with one protected file at a time (multiple uses of ARPR is possible);\n* all compression methods are supported;\n* self-extracting archives are supported;\n* you can select the custom character set for \\&quot;brute-force\\&quot; attack\n* you can interrupt the program at any time. Resuming is supported;\n* ARPR can work in the background, using the CPU only when it is in an idle state;\n* ARPR can utilise either a customizable \\&quot;brute-force\\&quot; approach, or an effective dictionary-based\n  approach. The different approaches can be used for all RAR types and compression methods\n  using AES (Rijndael) 128-bit encryption, e.g., set the password length (range) of the character set\n  used to generate the passwords, and many other options;\n* A multilingual interface is provided.\n\nThis copy includes the following dictionaries\n\n\nthe argon list ver1\nspanish\nrussian\nfrench\nenglish\nslang\nmovie characters\nlast names\nfamily names\nthe dictionary\ncommanly used passwords\n\n\nEverything about this works fine the crack is good and everything in it is clean\n\nThanks to Angelkiller for uploading the program and the crack i just added the dictionaries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f0137582ecd019fd23017b10e6ad681d2e0ce9","amp;dn":"Advanced+RAR+password+recovery+WITH+DICTIONARIES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f0137582ecd019fd23017b10e6ad681d2e0ce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,240,19,117,130,236,208,25,253,35,1,123,16,230,173,104,29,46,12,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
