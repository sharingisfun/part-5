A pupil of Isaiah Berlin at Oxford, Taylor taught at McGill University from 1961 to 1997, and is now a professor emeritus.\n\nTaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first major work, HEGEL (1975), was a large study of the 19th-century German philosopher that emphasized the ways in which HegelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s philosophy continues to be relevant to contemporary political and social theory.  SOURCES OF THE SELF (1989), which achieved a wide general readership, explored the multiplicity of the self, or the human subject, in the modern Western world.\n\nIn his later work Taylor became more overt about the ways in which being a practicing Roman Catholic shaped his intellectual agenda and approach.  Some hints about his religious views were dropped at the end of SOURCES OF THE SELF, but after the publication of that work his remarks on this topic became more frequent and more explicit.  Taylor, for example, injected himself into 21st-century debates about the role of religion in modern Western societies with his massive work A SECULAR AGE (2007), which tracked some of the major changes in Christian belief in Western societies during the last five centuries.  Despite the shifts in religion's content and its social location over time, Taylor seems to suggest that humans necessarily have some orientation toward what he calls &quot;transcendence&quot; -- some yearning for meaning that goes above and beyond the merely human.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format:\n\n* A CATHOLIC MODERNITY?: Charles Taylor's Marianist Award Lecture (Oxford University Press, 1999).
