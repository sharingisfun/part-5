A piece of pornogami folded in the right setting, he discovered, can produce smiles and laughter in a way that no butterfly or bird ever could. Shapes include a variety of erotic body parts, including the amazing 3-D penis. Those who have mastered the technique can produce their own adult objets d'art, but the book's simple, step-by-step instructions help even the creatively challenged to transform a drab piece of paper into a saucy surprise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bab766930f865b692429a856ac11b846185832f","amp;dn":"Pornogami%3A+A+Guide+to+the+Ancient+Art+of+Paper-Folding+for+Adult","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bab766930f865b692429a856ac11b846185832f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,171,118,105,48,248,101,182,146,66,154,133,106,193,27,132,97,133,131,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
