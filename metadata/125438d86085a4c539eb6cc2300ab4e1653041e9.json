And true to their rootsy form, the Toronto based trio does not disappoint. After a 5-day journey through the seasides towns, battlefields and cemeteries of the French and Belgian coasts, BROOD saw Canadian names etched in stone at a World War 1 cemetery and started writing a record. Inspired by ghosts and monuments, Days Into Years is a lasting piece of work in its own right.\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/11/21/elliott-brood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/11/21/elliott-brood/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125438d86085a4c539eb6cc2300ab4e1653041e9","amp;dn":"Elliott+Brood...Days+Into+Years%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125438d86085a4c539eb6cc2300ab4e1653041e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,84,56,216,96,133,164,197,57,235,108,194,48,10,180,225,101,48,65,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
