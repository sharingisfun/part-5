There is a breed of rock that hints at blues, fuzz pedals and a sense of melody and genuine emotion which has crawled from several ominous gutters located around the globe. Crobot are another fine example of this remarkable style. The sort of rock music on display here belongs in a sweaty and grimy bar somewhere. In an arena where live music is let loose to blossom brightly before an enthralled audience who lap up each and every chord and note that is sent into the hot yonder; an environment where eager bodies are crushed up against each other as the throng watch and listen to four individuals who unite to throw shapes and poses to a backdrop of distorted energy.\n\nNowhere to Hide, The Necromancer and Fly on the Wall push the right buttons and qualify as highlights within an audio bruiser consisting of 11 tracks. La Mano de Lucifer meanders a little to begin with before picking up the pace and invests a different tempo which is welcome. If you were to criticize Something Supernatural you may wish to point the guilty finger towards the lack of mellower moments which would bring a satisfying contrast to proceedings. Where albums deviate in to softer territories they bring about a stark contrast to the rocking elements and therefore showcase varied textures and an abundance of different flavors. Alas, this album does hint at such hidden pastures when listening to La Mano de Lucifer and album-closer Queen of the Light but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sustain the sentiment.\n\nIf your ears are hungry for some dirty groove-ridden twistinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and turninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rock music encapsulating all manner of influences into the mix, then this album might reach up and touch your soul. On the other hand, if you wish to be entertained in a straight ahead instant fashion, then let your inner-self digest and feast upon Nowhere to Hide and The Necromancer and content yourself with those nibbles. Not sure itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something supernatural, more like something superfluous.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething Supernatural was released on October 24th, so if the following words make you hunger for its rock groovings then you can already rush out and buy it!\nCrobot have released a cracking blend of blues, funk, country twang and old-style rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ music that just sits there, wiggles a bit and says Ã¢â‚¬Å“enjoy meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. If you last through half a track without tapping your foot then you need medical attention.\n\nSongs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChupacabraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ just jump straight in and assail you with blunt force riffage, whereas gentler numbers such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“La Mano de LuciferÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lull you into a gentle, relaxed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and false Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sense of ease before dropping the heaviness on you.\n\nSomething Supernatural is eleven tracks of head-banging, hair-swinging delight that should go down live very well indeed. Pretty much all of them just hook you from the first few notes and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let go until the final chords fade.\n\nStand-out tracks: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cloud SpillerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of the more frenetic numbers and I love the chorus. Ã¢â‚¬Å“NecromancerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a mouth organ in it. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist a bit of that.\n\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nThe Legend of the Spaceborne Killer  (2012)\nSomething Supernatural  (2014)\n\n\n\n\n\nLineup:\nBrandon Yeagley - Lead Vocals, Harmonica\nChris Bishop - Guitar, Vocals\nJake Figueroa - Bass\nPaul Figueroa - Drums\n\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Crobot\nAlbum: Claw\nGenre: Stoner Rock\nSubGenre:  Dirty Groove Rock, Heavy Metal\nYear: 2014\nCountry Of Origin:  USA\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320Kbs\nSize: 104 MB\nPlaytime: 00:45:07\nIncluded - Front Cover  \n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
