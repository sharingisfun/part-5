After stumbling across a seemingly perfect position, though, Zoe is blocked at every turn because of the one thing she can't take off her rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ© - human. \n\nNot to be put off by anything - especially not her blood-drinking boss or death goddess co-worker - Zoe delves deep into the monster world.
