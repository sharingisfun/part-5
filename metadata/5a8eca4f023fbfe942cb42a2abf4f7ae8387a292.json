Delay time can be set from anywhere to 0-10 seconds. This means what you are hearing is the actual audio being recorded to disk in real time, as it happens.\n\nEcho has been shown to contribute to EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon)\n\nNote: The Echo is not a digital effect added to the sound. It is a loop of the actual recording. An external/BlueTooth speaker is recommended for best results, also the louder the better.\n\nFEATURES:\n4 CHANNELS OF RANDOM PHONETIC AUDIO\n2 SOUND BANKS.\nREAL-TIME AUDIO RECORDING\nMULTIPLE DELAY SETTINGS\nMIC GAIN CONTROL\nUPLOAD TO SOUNDCLOUD\nFILE BROWSER/PLAYBACK\nSOUND BLEND/MIX\n\nCONTROLS:\nEach channel has independent playback speed control.\n\nMic gain controls microphone input volume\n\n&quot;Auto Blend&quot; blends across the 4 random audio channels\n\nEcho starts recording to disk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a8eca4f023fbfe942cb42a2abf4f7ae8387a292","amp;dn":"ECHOVOX+System+2.5+Ghost+Box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a8eca4f023fbfe942cb42a2abf4f7ae8387a292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,142,202,79,2,63,191,233,66,203,66,162,171,244,247,174,131,135,162,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
