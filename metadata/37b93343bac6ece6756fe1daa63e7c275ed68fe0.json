Having spent the last two years building a considerable reputation with their high-voltage brand of blues, dirty soul, and rock 'n' roll, Black Joe Lewis &amp; the Honeybears take it to another level with Scandalous.\nProduced by Jim Eno of Spoon and featuring 11 new songs, Scandalous finds the young band returning with their modern and original take on classic American musical styles. There are still plenty of tight horns and hard-driving rhythms on tracks like &quot;Livin' In The Jungle,&quot; &quot;Booty City,&quot; and &quot;Black Snake,&quot; but the new album is a decidedly more diverse and contemporary offering than its predecessor. Gospel punk burner &quot;You Been Lyin'&quot; fits squarely alongside the country blues of &quot;Messin'&quot; and the Stax-meets-Stones soul of &quot;Since I Met You Baby.&quot; The raw funk creeper &quot;She s So Scandalous&quot; stands out as an album highlight.\n\n\nsee also at my other torrents:      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/spikkie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/spikkie&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease help seeding this one for a while!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b93343bac6ece6756fe1daa63e7c275ed68fe0","amp;dn":"Black+Joe+Lewis+and+the+Honeybears+-+Scandalous+%282011%29+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b93343bac6ece6756fe1daa63e7c275ed68fe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,185,51,67,186,198,236,230,117,111,225,218,166,62,124,39,94,214,143,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
