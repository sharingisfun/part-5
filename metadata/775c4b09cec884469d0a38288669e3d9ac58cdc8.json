This was Sinatra's first full-length Christmas album. It features the Ralph Brewer Singers along with an orchestra conducted by Gordon Jenkins.\n\nIt can be argued that Sinatra never sounded fully comfortable singing Christmas carols, and this record is no exception. While his other albums of the period are bursting with dash and sensitivity, this is a distant, even slightly lackadaisical performance. Its no dud on its own, but compared to the classic Christmas records of other artists, and especially to Sinatra s best work, it is unusually somber. Gordon Jenkins adventurous arrangements are occasionally intrusive, but the album has touches of magic during *The Christmas Waltz* and *It Came Upon a Midnight Clear.* ... Allmusic\n\nCapitol reissued the album in 1963 with different cover art and a new title, The Sinatra Christmas Album, a title which also featured on the albums initial 1987 compact disc pressing. The original title and cover were eventually restored for subsequent CD pressings in 1990 and 1999. In 2001, the album art was altered from its 1957 version. The CD bonus tracks were originally issued on a 1954 Capitol 45 rpm single, arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. Jingle Bells (James Pierpont) - 2:00\n2.
