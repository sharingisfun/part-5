Until PlayClaw nothing worked too good with modern games, because cutting edge games try to hog every ounce of your PC's power, leaving little available to other applications. This results in choppy video, distorted still shots or massive bitmap files.\nUse full power of your multicore CPU\n\nMost game video capture software, if you can use it during a game at all, will slow your PC to a crawl. PlayClaw is different, making full use of any multi-core processors and with lean coding designed specifically for use during resource-hungry games!\n\nCapture all modern game graphics\n\nBe it OpenGL, DirectX 8,9,10 or 11, if your machine can run the game well you can now capture it all with virtually no hit to the frame-rate or action, even at full resolution video! You can also adjust the size for making smaller files. PlayClaw is good game video recording alternative.\nOnline gaming\n\nIt gets better! PlayClaw can also show you various set of screen overlays. The most important overlays are Teamspeak overlay and Ventrilo overlay. PlayClaw will show you who's speaking in games using Ventrilo or Teamspeak, making teamwork work better! Our overlays are fully compatible with the latest versions Windows and graphics engines. So if your game runs in Windows 7 with DirectX 11 graphics, it's not a problem!\n\nAt A Glance:\n\nCapture screenshots, capture game video with optional recording game audio\nAdjustable video recording frame rate and file sizes\nOutput in multiple formats\nVarious helpful overlays: Ventrilo/Teamspeak overlays, performance overlays, video recording statistics, GPU and CPU thermal sensors\nNew! Pre-record feature\nNew! Multisource audio recording\nNew! Ingame benchmarks\nNo slowdown with multicore CPUs\nPlays nice with Vista and Win7\n\nOS : Win XP/2000/Vista/Win 7\nLanguage : Multilingual\n\nHome Page - http://www.playclaw.com/\n\nEnjoy and please seed after download!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:953295a59e1053ba69f2fdcb323ee7397b7b657e","amp;dn":"PlayClaw+3.0+build+2048+Multilingual+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"953295a59e1053ba69f2fdcb323ee7397b7b657e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,50,149,165,158,16,83,186,105,242,253,203,50,62,231,57,123,123,101,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
