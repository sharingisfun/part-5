We have seen it twice this month in\n        the biggest releases of the month that you have supplied. Our\n        question is why? Please keep these opinions to yourself. \n        Please and Thank You.\n\n        No Props to FTD for not providing zee proof of the Classified. \n\n        Also, to that other somebody out there. There is no need to\n        title other groups in the scene as &quot;FAGS&quot; just because you\n        dont like the specific genre. Seriously. Whats the big deal?\n        Last. The rules indicate its perfectly fine to release. \n        4 divided 12 = 0.333333333%\n\n        Enjoy.\n\n\n                                Tracklisting\n\n     01.
