It is the last album to feature bassist Thomas MacLean.\n\nContents\nBackground and recording\n\nBand members Richard Henshall and Charlie Griffiths said of the album:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \tTo us, 'The Mountain' is symbolic of our journey as a band, but also reflects the wider trials and tribulations of life. Lyrically, we've done a lot of soul searching which has given the album an emotional depth that we're sure listeners will really relate to, whatever personal mountain they are climbing.\nMusically, the new songs feel rawer and more emotional than anything we've created in the past. All the essential elements of our sound are still there but have been delivered in a more gritty and focused style. We've really pushed ourselves in all areas and truly believe that this album is a step up from any of our previous work... \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n    \n   \n    3 Tracklist\n    4 Personnel\n        4.1 Haken\n       \n   Tracklist\n\nAll music composed by Richard Henshall except where noted.
