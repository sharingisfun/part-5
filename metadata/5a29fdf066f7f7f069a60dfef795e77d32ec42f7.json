Unfortunately, I could only find 88, meaning there are 3 missing. The 3 missing ones are:\n\n- Excuse Me Miss vs. Give It To Me Baby / Jay-Z ft. Pharrell Williams vs. Rick James\n- I Heard It Through The Grapevine vs. Let's Dance / Marvin Gaye vs. David Bowie\n- Rockit (Beat Juggle) / Herbie Hancock\n\nIf I find these 3, I'll upload them. All of the songs are ripped directly from the disc, except for Fight! Smash! Win! vs. Intergalactic.\n\nAlso, first upload, hope you like it ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a29fdf066f7f7f069a60dfef795e77d32ec42f7","amp;dn":"DJ+Hero+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a29fdf066f7f7f069a60dfef795e77d32ec42f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,41,253,240,102,247,247,240,105,166,13,254,247,149,231,125,50,236,66,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
