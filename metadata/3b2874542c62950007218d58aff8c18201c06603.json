Ensure reliable development and \n maintenance using a transparent modeling language \n and intuitive tools for model testing, profiling, \n and tuning.\n\n * Solving with mathematical programming: Complete \naccess to a powerful MP solver through the IDE, \nAPI, or via third party applications.  \n * Solving with constraint programming: Access to an  \noutstanding and proven CP solver as well, through  \nthe IDE, API, or via third party applications.  \n * Modeling: Create optimization models and extend \noptimization algorithms using the OPL modeling  \nlanguage, the ILOG Concert APIs, or numerous other \ninterfaces and connectors. \n * Developing: Develop, debug, test, and tune\nanalytical decision support applications. \n * Deploying: Deploy analytical decision support\napplications.  \n\n\n IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio provides the\n fastest way to build efficient optimization models\n and state-of-the-art applications for the full range \n of planning and scheduling problems. The \n Optimization Programming Language (OPL) provides a\n natural representation of optimization models, \n requiring far less effort than general-purpose \n programming languages. The Integrated Development \n Environment (IDE) makes it easy to evaluate \n different modeling approaches and to integrate \n external data. With its built-in development tools,  \n it supports the entire model development process. \n\n In addition to accessing the IBM ILOG CPLEX \n Optimizers for mathematical programming and \n constraint programming through the OPL language and  \n IDE, IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio also\n provides access through the ILOG Concert Technology  \n API in C++, Java, or Microsoft .NET, or through the  \n CPLEX Callable Library. Alternatively, IBM ILOG ODM  \n Enterprise embeds and integrates the modules of IBM  \n ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio to generate  \n state-of-the-art enterprise decision support\n applications with what-if scenario comparison  \n capabilities and tabular and graphic data views.  \n\n The IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio delivers the  \n tools to create both well-tested and finely tuned \n optimization models and interactive analytical \n decision-support applications. Advanced features  \n help users develop complete optimization \n applications-without requiring detailed knowledge of \n computer programming.  \n\n * IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio combines and \nsimplifies IBM's product offerings for \noptimization application development, solving, and \ndeployment. It offers in a single package, all the \nfunctionality that was previously available among  \nan array of product and component configurations,  \nmaking all tools and technologies available during \nprototyping and development.  \n\n * Natural representation of optimization problems.\nCompared to conventional programming languages, \nOptimization Programming Language (OPL) represents \noptimization problems descriptively, simplifying\nmodel development. OPL provides a rich toolkit to  \naddress a variety of problem types, allowing \ncomparisons of alternative and hybrid solution  \nmethodologies. \n\n * Support for two optimization technologies. The IBM \nILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio is designed to\nsupport IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer -the world's\nleading mathematical programming optimization\nengine, as well as IBM ILOG CPLEX CP Optimizer, \nour state-of-the-art constraint programming engine \nfor solving sequencing, resource allocation and \ntimetabling problems that are difficult or\nimpossible to solve with mathematical programming  \ntechniques. IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio  \nallows users to develop single models in either \ntechnology or multi-model solutions that use \neither or both technologies. Interval-based  \nscheduling support is available. It is based on \nthe &quot;model and run&quot; concept: Robust search\nalgorithms and automatic search parameter settings \nallow users to concentrate on modeling without  \nbeing worried about the search itself. \n\n * A full-featured scripting language. OPL Script is  \na full-featured JavaScript language for data \npre-processing, solution post-processing, and\nalgorithmic flow control. OPL Script also makes it \neasy to solve complex problems by combining or  \nsequencing related models. \n\n * Integrated application programming interfaces\n(APIs). Models created by IBM ILOG CPLEX  \nOptimization Studio can be easily integrated into  \nexternal applications written in Java, C++ or\n.NET, without having to rewrite the model in other \nprogramming languages.  \n\n * Connections to spreadsheets and relational\ndatabases. IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio can  \nimport data and export solutions to databases or\nspreadsheets. A clean separation of the model from \nthe data makes it easy to switch between test data \nfiles and production data sources.  \n\n * An interactive development environment. The IBM \nILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio integrated \ndevelopment environment (IDE) supports model \ndevelopment, data and parameter combinations \ntesting, and results reviews. The implementation\nof IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio's &quot;Run \nConfiguration&quot; concept allows users to evaluate \ndifferent modeling approaches to a problem with \nthe same data, and/or different data sets with a\ngiven model, and to experiment with different\nalgorithmic control parameter settings that  \ncombine models, data and parameter settings into\nrun configurations.  \n\n * Conflict detection/display and recommended\nconflict resolution. Detect and display\nconflicting constraints in infeasible models using \nCPLEX Optimizer's conflict refiner. Relax \nconstraints based on user defined priorities.\n\n * Execution tracing and profiling. Full access to \nCPLEX Optimizer and CP Optimizer log files enables \ntracking the solve progress. Use profiler to \nunderstand use of memory and time by different  \nphases of the execution process. \n\n * Automatic performance tuning. Use the IBM ILOG  \nCPLEX Optimizer tuning tool to automatically tune  \nengine performance on mathematical programming  \nmodels.  \n\n * Automatic application generation. IBM ILOG CPLEX\nOptimization Studio and IBM ILOG ODM Enterprise \nhave made it possible to automatically generate an \nIBM ILOG ODM Enterprise application from the \nstructure of an OPL model. A simple wizard-guided  \nstep provides the initial application. OPL data \nstructures are automatically mapped to data tables \nin IBM ILOG ODM Enterprise, decision variables and \nsolution metrics are mapped to solution views, and \nobjective functions are mapped to IBM ILOG ODM  \nEnterprise's interactive business goals.  \nConstraints marked as relaxable in the OPL model\nare exposed to the end user by name and priority,  \nallowing relaxations and trade-offs based on \nbusiness importance. \n\n\n IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio v1.x provides \n Operations Research (OR) practitioners, OEMs and  \n Consultants with leading solver engines, a modeling  \n language, a set of embedding APIs, and a client-server  \n environment provided by IBM ILOG CPLEX Enterprise Server.  \n\n Key enhancements include: \n * Easier migration from desktop to client server  \n * New capabilities in the IDE:  \n * Improved performance from the CPLEX Optimizer in\nsolving mixed integer programs\n * New capabilities in CPLEX Optimizer for quadratic  \nproblems - Dual values are provided for all problems  \n * Easier modeling with CPLEX CP Optimizer\n * Availability of CPLEX Enterprise Server on Linux OS\n * New licensing options\n\n\n\n  INSTALLATION NOTES  \n \n `TLB'  \n  Try it, Like it, Buy it!  \n \n  \n Unpack and read included install info for details.\n\n That's all. Have fun using it! ;)  \n\n___________________________________________________________________  \n\nAlways remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling  \nhome 'during install'. Once installed, disable 'check for automatic  \nupdates' option if available, so that you don't get it blacklisted.
