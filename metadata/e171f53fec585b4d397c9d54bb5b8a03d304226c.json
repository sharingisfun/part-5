Much of the film is dominated by Edmond O'Brien as mob boss Murdock, who while serving a term in federal prison becomes a singing sensation with his hit tune &quot;Rock Around the Rock Pile.&quot; Once he's sprung, Murdock hires impoverished agent Tom Miller (Tom Ewell), not to promote his own career, but to turn his curvaceous lady friend Jerri Jordan (Jayne Mansfield) into a star. Alas, Jerri has no singing or acting talent whatsoever, a fact that she's eager and willing to admit. A domestic type at heart, all Jerri really wants out of life is to marry Murdock, so that she can clean his house, cook his meals and raise his children. When Murdock refuses to grant her wishes, Jerri falls in love with Tom instead.\n\nEvery so often, director Tashlin takes time out from the plot to poke fun at such technical marvels as CinemaScope and Technicolor, and to lampoon the American male's fixation on female bosoms and bottoms (at one point, Jayne Mansfield leans towards the camera, her cleavage exposed as far as the censors will allow, and plaintively asks Tom Ewell if he believes that she's equipped for motherhood). While much of the humor in the film is dated, The Girl Can't Help It is an invaluable record of the pop-music scene of the 1950s, featuring such guest artists as Julie London (playing Tom Ewell's dream girl), Ray Anthony, Fats Domino, The Platters, Little Richard and his Band, Gene Vincent and his Blue Caps, the Treniers, Eddie Fontaine, Abbey Lincoln and Eddie Cochran. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049263/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049263/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nFrank Tashlin\n\n\n\tTom Ewell\t ... \tTom Miller\n\n\tJayne Mansfield\t... \tJerri Jordan\n\n\tEdmond O'Brien\t... \tMarty 'Fats' Murdock\n\tJulie London\t... \tHerself\n\tRay Anthony\t... \tHimself\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:33:30\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x336 2.14:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 911 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,15 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e171f53fec585b4d397c9d54bb5b8a03d304226c","amp;dn":"The+Girl+Can%5C%27t+Help+It+%281956%29+Jayne+Mansfield++Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e171f53fec585b4d397c9d54bb5b8a03d304226c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,113,245,63,236,88,91,77,57,124,157,84,187,91,138,3,211,4,34,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
