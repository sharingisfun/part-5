In this course, Adobe Photoshop principal product manager Bryan O'Neil Hughes shares his favorite techniques for transforming color photographs into black and white, a technique that provides more creative options than using your camera's black-and-white mode. Learn how to prepare and fine-tune your photographs in Lightroom, and then move them into Photoshop to take advantage of its nondestructive adjustment layers. Finally, take your photos (and video!) to the next level using the Silver Efex plugin and mobile apps like Photoshop Mix and Express. Bryan closes with a video that pulls all the lessons together in a single end-to-end workflow.\nTopics include:\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWhy black and white?\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tShooting with black and white in mind\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tPreparing color images\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBlack-and-white mixing and adding toning\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUtilizing presets effectively\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating black-and-white HDR images with Lightroom and Photoshop\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tTaking advantage of black-and-white adjustment layers\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdjusting the toning of images\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with the Silver Efex plugin\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tConverting to black and white on the go\n \n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:189da52d8184c7fead025a8c0eebf13214936ae0","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Black+and+White+with+Lightroom+and+Photoshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"189da52d8184c7fead025a8c0eebf13214936ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,157,165,45,129,132,199,254,173,2,90,140,14,235,241,50,20,147,106,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
