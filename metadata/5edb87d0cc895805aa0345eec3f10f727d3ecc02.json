SimplePlanes followed the release of SimplePhysics and SimpleRockets. Wikipedia \r\nInitial release date: 2014 \r\nDeveloper: Jundroo, LLC \r\nGenre: Simulation game \r\nMode: Single-player video game \r\nPlatforms: Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS \r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nWhat is Mod: \r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n&gt;Untouched \r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\nWhat is in this version : \r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n* New combat mission: Convoy Assault \r\n* New airplane race: Indy Air Race \r\n* 5 new car races \r\n* Revamped stock airplanes \r\n* New parts: Parachutes and Fuselage Inlets \r\n* AI spawning dialog \r\n* 3D printing and model exporting options \r\n* Bug fixes \r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nGame Review: \r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nNote: This game requires at least 512MB of RAM and a 1GHz CPU. \r\nBring all of the imaginative aircraft you've had in your head to life. \r\n\r\nSnap parts together to build your airplane's body. Place engines to add thrust. Design the wings and then strap yourself into the pilot's seat and see how it flies. \r\n\r\nAIRPLANE DESIGNER \r\nYou have the tools you'll need to bring almost any airplane to life. Use the flexible wing tool to change the shape of the wings and build almost anything. \r\n\r\nNext-generation fighters, WW2 warbirds, civilian aircraft, and everything in between, some people have even made dragons, trains, and space stations. \r\n\r\nDYNAMIC FLIGHT MODEL \r\nFlight simulation at its finest. Every little change you make in the designer impacts how the airplane flies. Weight distribution, thrust, lift, and drag are all calculated before creating the final flight model. \r\n\r\nREALTIME DAMAGE \r\nParts can break off in spectacular fashion while flying due to over-stress or by hitting something. The fun won't stop there though. You can keep on flying even with a missing wing if you've got the skills. \r\n\r\nSANDBOX MODE \r\nTest your airplane with no restrictions. So, you've had a rough landing and the left engine was knocked off? After watching the engine fly off into the sunset you may decide to go ahead and slap the throttle to full...give it another go with only one engine. \r\n\r\nCHALLENGES \r\nClimb into the cockpit of one of your custom aircraft and see how it does in the challenges. The challenges will keep you entertained for hours. Land on aircraft carriers, dodge surface-to-air missiles, race through courses, and so much more. \r\n\r\nAIRPLANE PAINTER \r\nUse pre-built themes, or paint every part of your bird to make it just the way you want. Share your favorite stylings with all of your friends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSS-PLATFORM AIRPLANE SHARING \r\nThere are no in-app purchases to get access to the airplanes people have shared; they are all available to download for free from http://www.SimplePlanes.com. You can use them even if they were made on another platform. \r\n\r\nCONTROLLER SUPPORT \r\nSimplePlanes supports USB gamepads/joysticks, and provides in-game input mapping for each control surface, as well as throttle, brakes, landing gear, pausing, cameras, etc. \r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL \r\nTutorials will help players learn the basics of real airplane design and the considerations that need to be taken when airplanes are made. \r\n\r\n \r\n---------------------\r\nMore At GooglePlay:-\r\n--------------------- \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jundroo.SimplePlanes\r\n\r\nHigh Quality Movies in Ultra compressed size \r\n\r\n\r\nwithout loss in Quality. \r\n\r\n&amp;&amp;&amp; \r\n\r\nFull Android Games &amp; App. \r\n\r\n\r\nXpoZ.Torrent \r\n\r\n\r\nPlz seed Back &amp; keep alive this torrent. \r\n\r\nIf You Need Seeder any of My torrent, Let me Know. \r\n\r\nI'm always there for Seeding. \r\n\r\nAnd Also If You Liked My Torrent, Plsz Don't Forget to Left FeedBack and Comment. \r\n\r\nMore Uploads &amp; For FeedBack Me..... \r\n\r\n\r\nFollow Me At Google+..........:- https://plus.google.com/+XpoZTorrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5edb87d0cc895805aa0345eec3f10f727d3ecc02","amp;dn":"SimplePlanes+v1.5.2.0+Mod+%5BUntouched%5D+Apk-XpoZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5edb87d0cc895805aa0345eec3f10f727d3ecc02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,219,135,208,204,137,88,5,170,3,69,238,195,241,15,114,125,62,204,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
