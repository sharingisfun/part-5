For over a decade, they retained their underground credibility without turning out a series of indistinguishable records that all sound the same. Instead, the band refined their attack, adding inflections of psychedelia, heavy metal, and hard rock along the way, as well as a considerable dose of melody. Between their 1982 debut and their first major-label record, 1993's Recipe for Hate, Bad Religion stayed vital in the hardcore community by tightening their musical execution and keeping their lyrics complex and righteously angry.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art/ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n01.The Day That The Earth Stalled\n02.Only Rain\n03.The Resist Stance\n04.Won't Somebody\n05.The Devil In Stitches\n06.Pride And The Pallor\n07.Wrong Way Kids\n08.Meeting Of The Minds\n09.Someone To Believe\n10.Avalon\n11.Cyanide\n12.Turn Your Back On Me\n13.Ad Hominem\n14.Where The Fun Is\n15.I Won't Say Anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f6c433054464fb804263c266847cefff441f36d","amp;dn":"%5BPunk%5D+Bad+Religion+-+The+Dissent+Of+Man+%282010%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f6c433054464fb804263c266847cefff441f36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,108,67,48,84,70,79,184,4,38,60,38,104,71,206,255,244,65,243,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
