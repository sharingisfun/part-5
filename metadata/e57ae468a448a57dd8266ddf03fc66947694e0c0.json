Recording sessions for the album took place in June 1992 at Death Row Studios in Los Angeles, California and at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. The album was named after a slang term for high-grade marijuana. The album cover is a homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers.[1] The Chronic was recorded by Dr. Dre following his departure from hip hop group N.W.A and Ruthless Records over a financial dispute, and consequently featured both subtle and direct insults at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A group member, Eazy-E. Although a solo album, it features almost as many appearances by Snoop Doggy Dogg, who used the album as a launch pad for his own solo career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e57ae468a448a57dd8266ddf03fc66947694e0c0","amp;dn":"Dr%2C+Dre-The+Chronic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e57ae468a448a57dd8266ddf03fc66947694e0c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,122,228,104,164,72,165,125,216,38,109,223,3,252,102,148,118,148,224,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
