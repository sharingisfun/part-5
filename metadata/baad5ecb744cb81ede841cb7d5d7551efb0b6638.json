Despite a limited mainstream exposure of four years, he is widely considered to have been the greatest electric guitarist in the history of popular music, and one of the most important musicians of the 20th century.\n\nInfluenced musically by American rock and roll and electric blues, following initial success in Europe with his band the Jimi Hendrix Experience, he achieved fame in the US after his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969, and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, before dying from drug-related asphyxia at the age of 27.\n\nInstrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume, gain and treble. He helped to popularize the use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, which he often used to deliver tonal exaggerations in his solos. He also pioneered experimentation with stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings.\n\nThe recipient of several prestigious rock music awards during his lifetime and posthumously, the Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. English Heritage erected a blue plaque to identify his former residence on Brook Street, London, in September 1997. Rolling Stone ranked his three non-posthumous studio albums, Are You Experienced (1967), Axis: Bold as Love (1967) and Electric Ladyland (1968) among the 100 greatest of all time; they ranked him the number one greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist. \n\n\n\nThe Best Of Jimi Hendrix 2010\n\n\nExperience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix is a greatest hits career-spanning compilation of Jimi Hendrix's best known music from 1966 to 1970 released on September 16, 1997, in the United Kingdom and on November 3, 1998, in the United States.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Purple Haze&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:52\n2.\t&quot;Fire&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n3.\t&quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n4.\t&quot;Hey Joe&quot; (Billy Roberts) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:30\n5.\t&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; (Bob Dylan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:59\n6.\t&quot;Stone Free&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n7.\t&quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:19\n8.\t&quot;Manic Depression&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:42\n9.\t&quot;Little Wing&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:25\n10.\t&quot;If 6 Was 9&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:34\n11.\t&quot;Foxy Lady&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:19\n12.\t&quot;Bold as Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:11\n13.\t&quot;Castles Made of Sand&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:47\n14.\t&quot;Red House&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n15.\t&quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:12\n16.\t&quot;Freedom&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:25\n17.\t&quot;Night Bird Flying&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n18.\t&quot;Angel&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n19.\t&quot;Dolly Dagger&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:45\n20.\t&quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; (John Stafford Smith) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:46 [Recorded live at Woodstock]\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baad5ecb744cb81ede841cb7d5d7551efb0b6638","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+The+Best+Of+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baad5ecb744cb81ede841cb7d5d7551efb0b6638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,173,94,203,116,76,184,30,222,132,28,183,213,215,85,30,251,11,102,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
