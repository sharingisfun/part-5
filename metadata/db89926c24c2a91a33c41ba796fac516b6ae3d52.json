Before disappearing, however, she did manage to send her sister \na mysterious paw print that seemed to suggest that the species was still flourishing somewhere\nin the vast Australian wilderness. Much like the Sasquatch, the Tasmanian Tiger is a creature that modern scientists\nhave dismissed as legend - but now that Nina has evidence, she's fully prepared to breach Tasmania's dense and dangerous forests\nin order to prove that the reclusive creature really exists. As Nina, her partner Matt (Whannell),\nhis old friend Jack (Phillips), and his girlfriend Rebecca (Melanie Vallejo) make their way deep into the heart of Tasmania\nit quickly becomes obvious that Nina is completely ignorant to one of the isolated island's darkest legends. \nBack in the 19th Century, when Australia was a barren penal colony, a dangerous convict named Alexander Pierce \n(aka &quot;The Pieman&quot;), staged a daring escape from the island's most heavily guarded prison. Later, in order to survive,\nPierce resorted to eating his fellow escapees. Though Pierce would be hung for cannibalism in 1824\nby the time he was captured it was already too late. Pierce had bred, passing on his insatiable \nappetite for human flesh the next generation. Nearly two centuries later the Tasmanian Tiger \nseems to have finally become extinct, though the Pieman's lineage is still going strong.Now, in a land where human meat is scarce,\nNina's expedition will fall prey to species with a savage appetite, and a murderous motivation\nto keep their bloodline strong.\n============================================\n          Dying Breed (2008) Film\n{__________________________________________}\nIMDB Ratings: 5,4/10 from 3.405 users    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1064744/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1064744/&lt;/a&gt;\nGenre: Horror | Thriller  \nDirector: Jody Dwyer\nProduced by: Michael Boughen, Rod Morris\nWritten by: Michael Boughen, Rod Morris\nStarring: Leigh Whannell, Mirrah Foulkes, Nathan Phillips, Melanie Vallejo\nRelease dates: 26 April 2008 (Tribeca Film Festival)\nLanguage: English\n============================================\nVideo Specifications:\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _}\nFormat/________________________________: MPEG-4\nFile size/_____________________________: 1.93 GiB\nDuration/______________________________: 1h 31mn\nOverall bit rate/______________________: 3 015 Kbps\nFormat/________________________________: AVC\nFormat/Info/___________________________: Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile/________________________: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4f072628270f037a617f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCodec ID/______________________________: H264\nBit rate/______________________________: 2 284 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate/______________________: 9 545 Kbps\nWidth/_________________________________: 1 280 pixels\nHeight/________________________________: 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio/__________________: 16:9\nFrame rate/____________________________: 23.976 fps\n============================================\nAudio (1) Specifications:\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _}\nFormat/________________________________: AAC\nFormat/Info/___________________________: Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile/________________________: LC\nDuration/______________________________: 1h 31mn\nBit rate/______________________________: 640 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate/______________________: 655 Kbps\nChannel(s)/____________________________: 6 channels\nSampling rate/_________________________: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage/______________________________: English\n============================================\nAudio (2) Specifications:\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _}\nFormat/________________________________: AAC\nFormat/Info/___________________________: Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile/________________________: LC\nDuration/______________________________: 1h 31mn\nBit rate/______________________________: 91.0 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate/______________________: 98.4 Kbps\nChannel(s)/____________________________: 2 channels\nSampling rate/_________________________: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage/______________________________: English\n============================================\nGreetz to all our friends from the past to present!!
