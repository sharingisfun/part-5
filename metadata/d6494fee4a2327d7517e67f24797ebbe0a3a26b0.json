The \nboard chairman announces that the rest of the \nmeeting will be closed, due to personnel issues. \nÃƒÂ´IssuesÃƒÂ¶ is correct. The proposal up for a vote \nbefore them is whether to authorize the killing \nof a local reporter. The vote is four to one in \nfavor.\n\nMeanwhile, not far away, Virgil Flowers is \nhelping out a friend by looking into a dognapping, \nwhich seems to be turning into something much \nbigger and uglierÃƒÂ¹a team of dognappers supplying \nmedical labsÃƒÂ¹when he gets a call from Lucas \nDavenport. A murdered body has been foundÃƒÂ¹and the \nvictim is a local reporter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6494fee4a2327d7517e67f24797ebbe0a3a26b0","amp;dn":"John+Sandford+-+Deadline+%28Virgil+Flowers+08%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6494fee4a2327d7517e67f24797ebbe0a3a26b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,73,79,238,74,35,39,215,81,126,103,242,71,151,235,190,10,58,38,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
