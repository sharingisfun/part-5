If you want to speed up your copying or if you regularly transfer large amounts of data and have to stop the process to perform some other disk-intensive task, this program may be just what you need.\n\nTeraCopy is designed to copy and move files at the maximum possible speed. It skips \nbad files during the copying process, and then displays them at the end of the transfer so that you can see which ones need attention. TeraCopy can automatically check the copied files for errors by calculating their CRC checksum values. It also provides a lot more information about the files being copied than its Windows counterpart. TeraCopy integrates with Windows Explorer's right-click menu and can be set as the default copy handler.\nCopy files faster\n\nTeraCopy uses dynamically adjusted buffers to reduce the seek times. Asynchronous copying speeds up the file transfer between two physical hard drives.\nPause and resume file transfer activities\nPause the copy process at any time in order to free up system resources and continue with a single click.\nError recovery\n\nIn case of a copy error, TeraCopy will try several times to recover and, in the worse \ncase scenario, will simply skip the file, not terminating the entire transfer.\nInteractive file list\n\nTeraCopy shows the failed file transfers and lets you fix the problem and recopy only the problem files.\nShell integration\n\nTeraCopy can completely replace the Explorer copy and move functions, in turn enabling you to work with files as usual.\nFull Unicode support.\n\nWindows 8 x64 support.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a02a3c25f770c4b5dfbeaf5531ebf49d4fb94a2","amp;dn":"Tera+Copy+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a02a3c25f770c4b5dfbeaf5531ebf49d4fb94a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,2,163,194,95,119,12,75,93,251,234,245,83,30,191,73,212,251,148,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
