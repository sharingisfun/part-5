It was not always so. But the sight of David Suchet finally emerging from the effeminate Poiroit that Agatha Christie placed him in, along with his screw-ball daughter and her good-for-nothing aristocratic suitor won me over.\n\nAs usual there are a comments text file and closed captions text files.\n\nThe movie comes in four chapters. The first two are in part one and the last two in part two.\n\nI hope this arrangement is not too confusing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797bed37696575920fd26526c7f4cb94de5e3775","amp;dn":"The+Way+We+Live+Now+%282001%29+BBC+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797bed37696575920fd26526c7f4cb94de5e3775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,123,237,55,105,101,117,146,15,210,101,38,199,244,203,148,222,94,55,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
