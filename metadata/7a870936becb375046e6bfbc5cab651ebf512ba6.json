Near the eastern shore of the Shivering Isles lies the capital and only city of New Sheoth, although there are several small towns and camps. One third of the city (Crucible) looks like and represents Dementia. Another third (Bliss) looks like and represents Mania. The final third is divided into half of both and is known as the Palace District. The Isles are threatened by an event called the &quot;Greymarch&quot; which happens at the end of each era, in which Jyggalag, Daedric Prince of Order completely destroys Sheogorath's kingdom, therefore forcing Sheogorath to rebuild it from scratch.\n\nThe Realm of Madness is considerably different in both look and feel than anything in the land of Cyrodiil. Lead designer Mark Nelson stated that the reason for the drastic change in theme was because &quot;People want to explore a new realm. Besides if you've played Oblivion for 200 hours, you've gotta be sick of gray stone castles.&quot; The new expansion pack has been estimated to have an additional 30ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“40 hours of gameplay available to players, and the Realm of Madness is said to be 25% of the size of Cyrodiil. There are 32 new types of unique ingredients added to the expansion, 10 new achievements, 10 new creatures (with different leveled versions), 9,500 new lines of dialogue, 200 new weapons and 80 pieces of armor and clothing.\n\n\nI've also added in all the Official Plugins and the latest Patch for Shivering Isle. Also included are some unofficial addons I feel add a great deal to the gameplay.\n\n - Natural Environments\n - Slof's Horses\n - Midas Magic Spells of Aurum\n - Elven Weaponry\n\nIt's just a straight ISO file. Just mount, install and play. Have Fun!\n\n\nElder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4623144","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a870936becb375046e6bfbc5cab651ebf512ba6","amp;dn":"Elder+Scrolls+IV%3A+Shivering+Isle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a870936becb375046e6bfbc5cab651ebf512ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,135,9,54,190,203,55,80,70,230,191,188,92,171,101,30,191,81,43,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
