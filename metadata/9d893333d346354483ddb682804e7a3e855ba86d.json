At\n  the user's fingertips are drum skins, bars, marimbas, plates, strings,  and\n  tubes that get sparked into life by a mallet and a flexible noise source.\n           \n           \n\n  Mix and match\n           \n    Chromaphone  combines  acoustic  resonators  to  create  drums, percussion,\n  string,  and  synth-like instruments.  Membranes,  bars, marimbas,  plates,\n  strings, and tubes form pairs that get sparked into life by a mallet and  a\n  flexible  noise  source.  The resonators'  material,  tuning,  and coupling\n  parameters allow  the creation  of a  wide range  of instruments  and sonic\n  colors. Whether real, innovative, or with an ethnic touch, Chromaphone will\n  fill your music with rich and organic tones.\n           \n\n  Compressor and equalizer\n           \n    These new additions are perfect to add punch and definition to your  sound,\n  letting you cut through any dense mix or stage.\n           \n\n    Melodies and beats\n           \n    Chromaphone's  sound  library  includes  a  wide  range  of  expressive and\n  responsive instruments that span  from warm and mellow  pitched percussions\n  for melodies to punchy one-shots and  kits for rhythm tracks. A wooden  bar\n  makes a xylophone, turned metallic it becomes a glockenspiel. Adding a tube\n  transforms it into a  vibraphone or marimba. Plates  shape up in bells  and\n  cymbals. Membranes are used for drum skins, combined with a tube they  make\n  bass drums, snares, congas and bongos.\n           \n           \n\n  One-shot revolution\n           \n    One-shots are no longer limited to the velocity dimension. Chromaphone uses\n  the entire keyboard range to  modulate volume, mallet noise and  stiffness,\n  noise filter frequency  and density, hit  position, and coupling  to open a\n  whole world of expressive soundsÃ¢â‚¬â€and that in a totally stepless fashion.\n         \n \n    Creative drum kits\n           \n    Chromaphone  ships with  ready-made creative  kit patches  where each  note\n  provides a  new sound  slightly different  from the  previous one. Over the\n  entire keyboard range the sound morphs  from bass drum to snare to  hi-hat.\n  Discover a mixture of electronic and acoustic qualities intertwined to form\n  highly playable, addictive, and always fresh drum sounds.\n           \n\n    Together ensemble\n           \n    A  key  feature of  Chromaphone  is a  brand-new  coupling technology.  The\n  coupling refers  to the  exchange of  acoustic energy  which occurs in real\n  life between  interacting objects.  Consider a  string bridged  to a wooden\n  soundboard,  both have  their own  behavior and  characteristics, but  when\n  assembled  together, they  merge into  a complex  string instrument.  In a\n  similar way, a  metal bar interacts  with the air  column from a  tube in a\n  vibraphone. Chromaphone is  the first and  only plug-in to  provide control\n  over  the coupling  of resonators.  The result  is vivid  instruments with\n  unmatched acoustic precision, sharpness and realism.\n\n\n  Neat features:\n\n  Real-time control over any parameters via host automation\n           \n  Host tempo synchronization for effects and modulations\n           \n  Relaxed editing with unlimited undo/redo capability\n           \n  Native 64-bit Audio Units (AU) VST plug-ins and AAX plug-ins\n\n\n\n\nSystem:\n           \n  Chromaphone runs in both 32- and 64-bit on Mac OS X and Windows making it compatible with nearly all DAWs.\n\nsee more at https://www.applied-acoustics.com/chromaphone/specifications/\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n\n                 1) Unzip, Unrar and install\n                           \n                 2) Disconnect from Internet !!!\n                           \n                 3) Load Plugin and click Authorize\n                           \n                 4) Copy Serial number from keygen\n                    and enter into authorization window\n                    Now wait until the &quot;Offline Options&quot;\n                    button appears, click it and\n                    paste challengecode into keygen\n                    then generate response and authorize\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
