Here you discover not only what VoIP is but how you can implement it in your company or home. (YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll even find out whether VoIP makes a lot of sense for your situation.)\nVoIP has particular appeal to those who want to use their computer network to carry their telephone calls, thereby saving the expense of running different networks for each.\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a consumer running broadband Internet services and you have sig- nificant toll charges each month, you should look into VoIP to make your toll calls. With VoIP running on your broadband line, you can save money each month by reducing your toll costs while still maintaining your traditional tele- phone service for local calls.\nNote 1: If you can not open the downloaded file, and your Adobe Reader reports on the damaged file, then update your Adobe Reader.
