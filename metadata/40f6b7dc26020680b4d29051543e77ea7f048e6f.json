First come rejection and suspicion, but also fascination. Fresa y chocolate is the story of a great friendship, that is, a great love between two men, which overcomes incomprehension and intolerance.\n\nreview on imdb\nThis film is not about two gay men, as one character is gay, the other is straight. It is a movie about how two people who seem to be very different are really very similar. Both love their country and they learn that love of man (or of woman) and of country can be expressed differently and still be valued and respected. It is a wonderful, charming, endearing and -- Tom Wienerthoroughly well acted movie. It is extremely realistic and gives and shows a snapshot of Cuba we are not able to see or partake of. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is funny, well acted and well written and directed. The two male leads are superior as is the female character. I have seen this movie many times and never tire of it. I most highly recommend it. It is not a gay film, so don&amp;#039;t think of it that way or you will be very disappointed.\n\nreview on amg\nThe setup sounds like Kiss of the Spider Woman -- committed politico and homosexual exchange views in a Latin American setting -- but the mood is less grim and surrealistic. The odd couple dynamic works here because the script doesn&amp;#039;t turn David, the young Communist, and Diego, the gay man, into symbols. David is young enough to be blindly committed to the cause of Communism, but not so entrenched in his social views as to dismiss Diego out of hand. Once Diego understands that David will not yield to him sexually, he tries to seduce him intellectually by offering him books to read and challenging his knee-jerk world view. Diego&amp;#039;s apartment becomes their shelter from the world, a place where they enjoy music, discussions, and good food. David&amp;#039;s sexual relationship with Diego&amp;#039;s neighbor, Nancy, actually serves to bind the men closer together, as Nancy is Diego&amp;#039;s best friend and confidante. The film doesn&amp;#039;t flinch from portraying the Castro government&amp;#039;s persecution of gays, but director TomÃƒÂ¡s GutiÃƒÂ©rrez Alea may have sidestepped political heat by setting the story in 1979. Both leads are terrific; Vladimir Cruz ably charts David&amp;#039;s subtle changes, and Jorge Perrugoria makes Diego a character of enormous charm and sympathy.\n\n~~~~~~ Strawberry and Chocolate.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,305,976,832                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:44:27                \nFrame Count:....................................150242             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................368                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.913                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1531                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP..................N-VOP......                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.246&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................123                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2    \n\nI-VOPs: 925 (0.62%)\nP-VOPs: 75648 (50.35%)\nB-VOPs: 73667 (49.03%)\nS-VOPs: 0 (0.00%)\nN-VOPs: 2 (0.00%)    \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/1-4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/1-4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/2-4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/2-4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/3-4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/3-4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/4-4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/4-4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/5-4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/5-4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/6-4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/6-4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUnfortunate that the last screen with it&amp;#039;s classic shot of Havana&amp;#039;s harbor is focused on the foreground.\n\nMy rip, enjoy.   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f6b7dc26020680b4d29051543e77ea7f048e6f","amp;dn":"Strawberry+and+Chocolate+aka+Fresa+y+chocolate+%281994%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f6b7dc26020680b4d29051543e77ea7f048e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,246,183,220,38,2,6,128,180,210,144,81,84,62,119,234,127,4,142,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
