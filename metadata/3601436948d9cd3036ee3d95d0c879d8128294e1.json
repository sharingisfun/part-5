According to church founder Bobby Henderson, the universe and all life within it were created by a mystical and divine being: the Flying Spaghetti Monster. What drives the FSMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devout followers, a.k.a. Pastafarians? Some say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the assuring touch from the FSMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“noodly appendage.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then there are those who love the worship service, which is conducted in pirate talk and attended by congregants in dashing buccaneer garb. Still others are drawn to the ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flimsy moral standards, religious holidays every Friday, or the fact that Pastafarian heaven is way cooler: Does your heaven have a Stripper Factory and a Beer Volcano? Intelligent Design has finally met its matchÃ¢â‚¬â€œand it has nothing to do with apes or the Olive Garden of Eden.\n\nWithin these pages, Bobby Henderson outlines the true factsÃ¢â‚¬â€œ dispelling such malicious myths as evolution (Ã¢â‚¬Å“only a theoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), science (Ã¢â‚¬Å“only a lot of theoriesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and whether weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really descended from apes (fact: Humans share 95 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees, but they share 99.9 percent with pirates!)\nSee what impressively credentialed top scientists have to say:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If Intelligent Design is taught in schools, equal time should be given to the FSM theory and the non-FSM theory.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œProfessor Douglas Shaw, Ph.D.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Do not be hypocritical. Allow equal time for other alternative Ã¢â‚¬ËœtheoriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ like FSMism, which is by far the tastier choice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œJ. Simon, Ph.D.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In my scientific opinion, when comparing the two theories, FSM theory seems to be more valid than classic ID theory.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œAfshin Beheshti, Ph.D.\n\nRead the book and decide for yourself!&quot;\n\nReviews:\n&quot;An elaborate spoof on Intelligent Design, The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is neither too elaborate nor too spoofy to succeed in nailing the fallacies of ID. It's even wackier than Jonathan Swift's suggestion that the Irish eat their children as a way to keep them from being a burden, and it may offend just as many people, but Henderson, described elsewhere as a 25-year-old &quot;out-of-work physics major,&quot; puts satire to the same serious use that Swift did. Oh, yes, it is very funny.&quot; -Scientific American Magazine\n\nThis torrent contains a retail EPUB copy of the book which I have converted into MOBI, LIT, AZW3 and large print PDF formats in Calibre.
