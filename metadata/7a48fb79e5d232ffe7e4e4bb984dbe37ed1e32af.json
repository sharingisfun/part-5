While staying pretty true to the blueprint of the early emo genre with obtuse yet jangly guitar lines and urgent vocals, tracks like &quot;Flightboat&quot; blend in post-rock elements like buoyant trumpet and airy synth lines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a48fb79e5d232ffe7e4e4bb984dbe37ed1e32af","amp;dn":"The+World+is+a+Beautiful+Place+-+Whenever%2C+if+Ever+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a48fb79e5d232ffe7e4e4bb984dbe37ed1e32af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,72,251,121,229,210,50,255,231,228,228,187,152,77,190,55,237,30,50,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
