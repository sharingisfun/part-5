The follow-up to 2007's &quot;White Darkness&quot; features artwork by Travis Smith (OPETH, NEVERMORE, KATATONIA) and the music should appeal to fans of bands like RUSH, MARILLION, STYX, KANSAS, THRESHOLD, and even OPETH and KATATONIA.\n\nNIGHTINGALE was established by musical multi-talent and producer Dan SwanÃƒÂ¶ (EDGE OF SANITY, WITHERSCAPE) almost 20 years ago and in the good tradition of the band Ã¢â‚¬â€ which is completed by Dan's brother Dag SwanÃƒÂ¶ (guitars, keyboards), Erik Oskarsson (bass) and Tom BjÃƒÂ¶rn (drums) Ã¢â‚¬â€ the new album once again showcases a fabulous and timeless hybrid of different musical styles. From atmospheric metal to catchy AOR and melodic prog, &quot;Retribution&quot; offers an amazingly broad variety of moods and always tuneful songwriting skills.\n\nDan SwanÃƒÂ¶, who hands vocals, guitars and keyboards for NIGHTINGALE, commented on &quot;Retribution&quot;: &quot;We started putting material together for this album around 2008, but out of all those songs, only two made it to the album.\n\n&quot;I felt that, unless it is the best possible NIGHTINGALE album, where every song on the album easily could replace any song from our previous albums, there was no point in making a new album at all.\n\n&quot;During the writing of the WITHERSCAPE debut album, I wrote a lot of stuff that would work better on a NIGHTINGALE album, and before I knew it, I had the skeleton for a lot of potentially awesome NIGHTINGALE songs!\n\n&quot;It was important that the new material had the vibe of the older albums, yet with a better production and performance.\n\n&quot;I am very confident that all the NIGHTINGALE fans will love 'Retribution' since I made sure I felt the same rush inside me when I listened to the tracks that I did upon listening to the finished version of our most famous tracks from the past!&quot;\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Retribution&quot; track listing:\n\n01. On Stolen Wings\n02. Lucifer's Lament\n03. Chasing The Storm Away\n04. Warriors Of The Dawn\n05. Forevermore\n06. Divided I Fall\n07. The Voyage Of Endurance\n08. 27 (Curse Or Coincidence?)\n09.
