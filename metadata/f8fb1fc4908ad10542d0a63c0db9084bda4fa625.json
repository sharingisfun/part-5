The album also brought the singer back to the tops of the Hi-NRG charts and dancefloors with its first single, &quot;Moonlight On Water&quot;, and a trendy update of Vicki Sue Robinson's disco-era &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;. The latter was the first of many songs on which Branigan added production to her list of credits. A slew of promo remixes were embraced by many of the DJs who first brought her to fame with &quot;Gloria&quot;, but &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot; did not make the broader US national dance chart and did not receive an official single release.\r\nWhile a sexy video supported the lead-off single (which was subtitled &quot;Sex On The Beach&quot; on DJ pressings), Laura Branigan became her first album since 1983's Branigan 2 to be promoted by only one music video. While the album was Laura's last to be commercially available as a vinyl LP, &quot;Moonlight On Water&quot; and &quot;Never In A Million Years&quot; were also Branigan's first singles not to be released in the 7&quot; vinyl format. This was Branigan's first album not to produce a Top 40 Billboard Hot 100 hit.\r\nThe song &quot;Unison&quot; was recorded by Celine Dion the same year. The album's final track was another Branigan production, a subdued cover of Bryan Adams' &quot;The Best Was Yet to Come&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8fb1fc4908ad10542d0a63c0db9084bda4fa625","amp;dn":"Laura+Branigan+-+Laura+Branigan+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8fb1fc4908ad10542d0a63c0db9084bda4fa625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,251,31,196,144,138,209,5,66,208,166,60,13,185,8,75,218,79,166,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
