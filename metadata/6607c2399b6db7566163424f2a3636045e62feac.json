Focused on the detailed description of how string theory is connected to the real world of particle physics, it provides explicit models of physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\n&quot;... invaluable as a textbook for curious students, and a reference volume of lasting value for experts working in the field. If, as many of us hope, the LHC era reveals new clues linking particle physics to string-scale physics, acquaintance with the material in this volume may well provide crucial tools for exploring and exploiting those links.&quot;\nShamit Kachru, Stanford University and SLAC\n\n&quot;A clear exposition of the main ideas and ingredients necessary to connect string theory to the real world. An essential toolkit for the string theory model builder&quot;\nJuan Maldacena, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton\n\n&quot;The scope of this book is impressive, covering all the major developments in the construction of compactified string theories. As an introduction to string theory it is excellent and, as a tool for constructing realistic models, unmatched. Essential reading for all those wishing to study string theory in depth and an invaluable reference for those already expert in the field.&quot;\nGraham Ross, University of Oxford ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6607c2399b6db7566163424f2a3636045e62feac","amp;dn":"String+Theory+and+Particle+Physics+%5BText+Book%5D+PDF_%28K-Slender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6607c2399b6db7566163424f2a3636045e62feac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,7,194,57,155,109,183,86,97,99,66,79,42,54,54,4,94,98,254,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
