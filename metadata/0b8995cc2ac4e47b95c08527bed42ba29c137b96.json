Adopting the name America, the group landed a contract with Jeff Dexter, a promoter for the Roundhouse concert venue. Dexter had America open for several major artists and the group soon signed with Warner Bros. Records. By the fall of 1970, the group was recording their debut album in London, with producers Ian Samwell and Jeff Dexter. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.A Horse With No Name\n02.I Need You\n03.Sandman\n04.Ventura Highway\n05.Don't Cross The River\n06.Only In Your Heart\n07.Muskrat Love\n08.Tin Man\n09.Lonely People\n10.Sister Golden Hair\n11.Daisy Jane\n12.Woman Tonight\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b8995cc2ac4e47b95c08527bed42ba29c137b96","amp;dn":"America+-+Greatest+Hits+%281975%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b8995cc2ac4e47b95c08527bed42ba29c137b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,137,149,204,42,196,228,123,149,192,133,39,190,212,43,162,156,19,123,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
