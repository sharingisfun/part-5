Featuring pensive lyrics, lush instrumentation, and stellar female vocals, this record is a rare jewel in the seas of overproduced hybrid music.  From the dark almost-grunge haunts of &quot;Into Black&quot; to the 80's new wave/synthpop of &quot;Videotapes,&quot; there is something for just about everyone here.  Blouse most recently performed at SXSW to rave reviews.  Two bonus tracks from Blouse's previous EP are also included.\n\n01. Firestarter\n02. Time Travel\n03. They Always Fly Away\n04. Into Black\n05. Videotapes\n06. Controller\n07. Roses\n08. White\n09. Ghost Dream\n10. Fountain in Rewind\n11. Nights &amp; Days (Bonus Track)\n12.
