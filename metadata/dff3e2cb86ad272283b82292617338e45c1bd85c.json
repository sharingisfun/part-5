It is now regarded as a classic and influential rock and roll and punk rock album by many fans and critics alike.\n\nThe album was released on October 28, 1977 on the Virgin Records label, amid controversy arising from the use of the obscenity (in British english) &quot;bollocks&quot; in its title. It is the only &quot;official&quot; album recorded by the Sex Pistols in their short 2Ã‚Â½ year career, although the songs have appeared on many compilation albums (the group had effectively disbanded less than three months after its release). Additionally, many of the songs were featured in the film, The Great Rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Roll Swindle, a &quot;mockumentary&quot; loosely based on the Sex Pistols, but more about their infamous manager (and the film&amp;#039;s mastermind), Malcolm McLaren and his stated goal of &quot;making a million pounds&quot;.\n\nOlder versions of most of these songs also appear on a bootleg album called Spunk, which consists of demo recordings the band had made during 1976 and January 1977, which was released shortly before Never Mind the Bollocks.\n\nA special deluxe edition is rumoured to be released in Autumn 2007 to mark the 30th anniversary of the albums release.\n\nReleased October 28, 1977 (UK) November 10, 1977 (US) \nRecorded October 1976,\nMarch to June 1977,\nAugust 1977 at Wessex Studios in London \nGenre Punk \nLength 38:47 \nLabel Virgin (UK)\nWarner Bros.
