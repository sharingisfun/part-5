It is a scientific look at how ancient humans made sense of the world and the phenomena they encountered around them.\n\nIn the past, arguments against the existence of gods have mainly come in the form of scientific inquiries that attempt to show there is no evidence for their existence. The Invention of Religion, however, investigates the psychological mechanisms that cause religions to originate and it sets out to prove that when humans have neither science nor religion, these mechanisms cause them to invent new religions. It also investigates how the differences (like monotheism vs. pantheism) between religions arise and how probable these differences are","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba3d2eed1c04bd4e0c2c5926db923b0a5910187","amp;dn":"The+Invention+of+Religion+%5BAlexander+Drake-2013%5D+%7BCharm-Quark%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba3d2eed1c04bd4e0c2c5926db923b0a5910187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,163,210,238,209,192,75,212,224,194,197,146,109,185,35,176,165,145,1,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
