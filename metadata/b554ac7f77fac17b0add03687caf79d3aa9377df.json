From the mind of the equally divisive Grant Morrison, this story is about Darkseid's quest for the Anti-Life equation finally coming to frution, and the superhero community's attempts to stop him from controlling all and annihilating those who oppose him. This torrent is NOT the complete, bloated event with every tie-in - those are easy enough to find and that is not the purpose of this collection. This is only those parts of the story written by Morrison in digital excluding Final Crisis: Submit, which is not yet available digitally. However, it is the least necessary part of the story and everything else is included: Final Crisis 01-07, Final Crisis: Superman Beyond 01-02, and Batman 682-683. I have numbered them in the reading order prescribed by Morrison, in order for the already somewhat confusing story to make the most sense to those having difficulty understanding it. The Batman scans are from Zone-Empire, while the rest is Minutemen-PhD. Like it or not, this story had a big impact on DC continuity for years to come - especially for Batman! - and directly feeds into the 2011 Flashpoint crossover that rebooted DC into the New 52. Thanks to the rippers for these copies, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b554ac7f77fac17b0add03687caf79d3aa9377df","amp;dn":"Final+Crisis+01-07+%2B+Ex+%282008-2009%2C+Dgtl%2C+MM-PhD+%2B+Zone-E%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b554ac7f77fac17b0add03687caf79d3aa9377df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,84,172,127,119,250,193,123,10,221,3,104,124,175,121,211,170,147,119,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
