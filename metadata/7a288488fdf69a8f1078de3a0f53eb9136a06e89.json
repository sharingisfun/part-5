The four novels are Emperor, Conqueror, Navigator, and Weaver.\nThe narrative begins in 4 BC and ends in 1943 (in a different timeline than our own).\nIn short, the science-fiction premise of this alternate-history epic is that our timeline today, i.e., history as we know it, is the result of a series of interventions from an alternate future into its past, the last of which occurs as the story ends, resulting in our own timeline.\n\n\nEmperor\t2006\tISBN 0-575-07432-9\t \nConqueror\t2007\tISBN 0-575-07673-9\t \nNavigator\t2007\tISBN 978-0-441-01559-7\t \nWeaver\t2008\tISBN 978-0-575-08204-5\t \n\n\nEmperor (Stephen Baxter)\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nEmperor  \n\nAuthor(s)\tStephen Baxter\nCountry\tUnited Kingdom\nLanguage\tEnglish\nSeries\tTime's Tapestry\nGenre(s)\tAlternate history Science fiction\nPublisher\tAce (U.S./Canada release)\nPublication date\tJuly 2006 (U.K. Gollancz hardcover edition)\nMedia type\tPrint (Hardcover Paperback)\nPages\t368 pp (mass-market paperback)\nBook one of four in Stephen Baxter's alternate history and science fiction series Time's Tapestry.\n[edit]Synopsis\n\nA mysterious prophecy from the future shapes the destiny of a family through four centuries of the Roman occupation of Britain.
