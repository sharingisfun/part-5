Despite the billions of dollars of funding and research into new \n    so-called cures we continue to suffer from a raft of chronic ills and every \n    day maladies. Patching up an over-toxic and over indulgent population with \n    a host of toxic therapies and nutrient sparse foods is definitely not \n    helping the situation. Add on the high demands made upon our already \n    over-burdened health care system and it s little wonder that doctors and \n    health care practitioners have less and less time to teach people about how \n    to eat and live well, precisely the information that could prevent people \n    from being there in the first place. Food Matters hosts several world \n    leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we \n    harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of \n    foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic \n    illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer. The film sets about \n    uncovering the trillion dollar worldwide sickness industry and points out \n    that not every problem requires costly, major medical attention and reveals \n    many alternative therapies that can be more effective, more economical and \n    less harmful than conventional medical treatments. Find out what works, \n    what doesn't and what's killing you. Becoming informed about the choices \n    you have for you and your family s health could save your life.\n\nNotes:\n\n    This film has been transcoded from non-free formats to free container, \n    video, and audio codecs due to the serious nature of the inherent social \n    and ethical problems created through the use of proprietary software and \n    media formats.
