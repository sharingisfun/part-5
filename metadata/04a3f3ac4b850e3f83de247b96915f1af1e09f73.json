Ahmad's trio with Frank Gant and Jamil Sulieman is joined by the Howard A Roberts Chorale, set to arrangements by Jamal and Joe Kennedy that create these dreamy pillows of sound, pushing the voices forward like piles of feathers, supporting Ahmad's lines on piano with amazing subtlety, evoking a really moody late night sound. Richard Evans produced, and the whol thing has that sophisticated groove of the best late 60s Cadet work. Titles include &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;, &quot;Wild Is The Wind&quot;, &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, &quot;Of Bass I Love&quot;, and &quot;By Myself&quot; ~ Dusty Groove's Review\n\nPersonnel:\nAhmad Jamal (piano)\nJamil Sulieman (bass)\nFrank Gant (drums)\nVoices: The Howard A.
