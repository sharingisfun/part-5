Noi (17) drifts through life in a remote fjord in northern Iceland. In the winter, the fjord is completely cut off from the outside world, encircled by terrifying mountains under a thick layer of snow. Noi dreams of escaping from this white prison, together with Iris, a city girl who works at the local filling station. But Noi's clumsy attempts to escape don't get him anywhere, and only get out of hand.\n\nThis is a truly wonderful movie with beautiful shots of the snowy, cold Icelandic landscape. Totally recommended to any lovers of non-mainstream and/or independant films.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:124700375149229852b1b054f1563d0a72f9b629","amp;dn":"N%C3%83%C2%B3i+alb%C3%83%C2%ADn%C3%83%C2%B3i+%28Noi+the+Albino%29+%282003%29+Icelandic+with+softsubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"124700375149229852b1b054f1563d0a72f9b629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,71,0,55,81,73,34,152,82,177,176,84,241,86,61,10,114,249,182,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
