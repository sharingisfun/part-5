It was a four-week 1969 number-one hit single by fictional characters The Archies. Produced by Jeff Barry, the song was originally released on the album Everything's Archie. The album is the product of a group of studio musicians managed by Don Kirshner. Ron Dante's lead vocals were accompanied by those of Toni Wine (who sang the line &quot;I'm gonna make your life so sweet&quot;), Andy Kim, and Ellie Greenwich. Together, they provided the voices of the various Archies using multitracking. Ray Stevens, the comic singer, provided the hand claps to the song. \nThe ArchieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; was the 1969 number one single of the year.

The song lists at #63 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time.On February 5, 2006, &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, as co-writer Andy Kim is originally from Montreal, Quebec.\n&quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; is considered the canonical example of the bubblegum pop musical genre.
