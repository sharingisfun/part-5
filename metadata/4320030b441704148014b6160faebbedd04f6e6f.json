But as they grow older they all begin to see their lives moving in directions they never dreamed. So they embark on a cattle drive to recapture their lost youth and &quot;find themselves&quot;. The three &quot;City Slickers&quot; try to re-create the old west they had always dreamed about. This &quot;fantasy&quot; vacation turns into one hysterical adventure. Learning to rope and ride is trickier (and funnier), then you think. But the toughest part is dealing with the tough ranch hands. One in particular...&quot;Curly&quot;(Jack Palance)...is one bad hombre as he scares these guys out of their wits. They are joined by several others as the drive begins from New Mexico to Colorado and anything than can go wrong... does! There&amp;#039;s a stampede, a runaway wagon, and Mitch even has to deliver a calf. Their cell phones are no help here! There&amp;#039;s also mucho male bonding going on during the trek. These guys even bond with the cows! They learn about each other and with the help of the very tough Curly, they even learn what is important in life.\n\n  Starring: Billy Crystal, Jack Palance, Daniel Stern, Bruno Kirby, Patricia Wettig, Helen Slater.\n\n  Directed by: Ron Underwood.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr.  54min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x  368\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4320030b441704148014b6160faebbedd04f6e6f","amp;dn":"City+Slickers+%281991%29+%28Billy+Crystal%2C+Jack+Palance%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4320030b441704148014b6160faebbedd04f6e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,32,3,11,68,23,4,20,128,20,182,22,15,174,187,237,208,79,110,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
