So I thought I'd buy their album one day and I have to say I was blown away! \nThe Fun Lovin Criminals are brilliant! Howie has the coolest voice and songs like 'Fun Lovin Criminal' and not to mention the crazy cover version of Louie Armstrong's 'We have all the time in the world' prove this! The Criminals have a song for all moods which is why they are so universal. \nThey mix swing, jazz, blues, rap and slight rock so effectivly! In parts they are hilarious and in parts deadly serious which is why they are so original.\nAll I have to say is buy it now and be blown away!
