These trains were a vital cog in the military machine from carrying troops, to moving hospitals, to being transformed into actual weapons. In this compelling series we tell the stories of these incredible trains...\r\nWe combine expert interviews, authentic reconstruction, engineering graphics and archive, highlighting the extraordinary human stories alongside the engineering detail and military perspective. The stories are dramatic, exciting and filled with fascinating historical detail. Each of these incredible stories is set against a backdrop of conflict and we put the events into context. In addition to the stories of the trains we learn more about the military, political and domestic battles happening at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Nazi Railways \r\nNazi Germany boasted that its locomotives were faster and more innovative, and this programme examines that claim by looking at the &quot;flying trains&quot;. The Reichsbahn was responsible for the army's massive railway guns, and using stunning archive of a surviving K5 gun in action, military historian Al Keonig explains its success. Hitler preferred auto mobiles to the train, and historian Christian Wolmar argues that this was a fatal flaw - leading to defeat in Russia. Through the story of two Auschwitz survivors, we reveal how an entire railway network, involving thousands of people - was used to carry out mass murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 1666 Kbps\r\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 8\r\n * Part Size: 518 MB\r\n * Source: PDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1918/combat-trains-the-death-railway","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06cf940fca698ddd5541c7657583e0f2f0dbd7bd","amp;dn":"Combat+Trains+1of8+Nazi+Railways+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06cf940fca698ddd5541c7657583e0f2f0dbd7bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,207,148,15,202,105,141,221,85,65,199,101,117,131,224,242,240,219,215,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
