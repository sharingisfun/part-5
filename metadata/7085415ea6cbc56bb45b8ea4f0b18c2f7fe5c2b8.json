Dire Straits' sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, and blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more &quot;rootsy&quot; influence that emerged from pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic. Dire Straits' biggest selling album, Brothers in Arms, has sold over 30 million copies, and was the first album to sell a million copies on Compact Disc.\n\n29 Million copies sold. Third best-selling album of all time in the UK. First album to succeed in the CD market, Grammy winning, earner of enough Platinum to build a house: Brothers In Arms is a phenomenon on every level. Its production raised the bar for all music to come, its songs and videos became household items. It also almost destroyed the band.\n\nBy 1984, incessant touring and recording schedules hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dimmed Mark KnopflerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enthusiasm for perfection. Having taken over the production duties on previous album Love Over Gold, he now went even further towards a kind of pop-oriented Americana. BrothersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦has a fine array of chart moments, including, of course, the Sting-assisted video hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Money for NothingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the moody Ã¢â‚¬Å“So far AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and faux bop Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walk Of LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. But it gets them out of the way in the manner of mere aperitifs and then massages you with a suite of KnopflerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very fine brand of JJ Cale-lite. Along with gruff nods to Dylan and James Burton. Like contemporaries U2 they had the golden touch that made their gold instantly more American and mythical than most acts from the States.\n\nThey toured this album for two years. After that amount of time surely any band would falter. They certainly had a very long hiatus. This album was bigger than them. On that final night of the tour in they must have never wanted to hear a note of this album again. Twenty years on, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still echoing around the world. As inescapable as ever.\n\nDFF tracks extracted with Scarletbook\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfrom the Japanese 2014 SHM-SACD.\n\nSHM-SACD-ISO-DFF-1Bit-2.8Mhz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7085415ea6cbc56bb45b8ea4f0b18c2f7fe5c2b8","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+Brothers+In+Arms+%281985%29+2014+SHM-SACD-DFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7085415ea6cbc56bb45b8ea4f0b18c2f7fe5c2b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,133,65,94,166,203,197,107,180,91,142,164,240,177,140,47,127,229,194,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
