In his superb biography, Neal Gabler shows us how, over the course of two decades, Disney revolutionized the entertainment industry. In a way that was unprecedented and later widely imitated, he built a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise. Walt Disney is a revelation of both the work and the manÃ¢â‚¬â€œof both the remarkable accomplishment and the hidden life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:472f5e0e58273bf06c0868093092c9f41a51c22e","amp;dn":"Walt+Disney+-+The+Triumph+of+the+American+Imagination+-+EPUB+-+W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"472f5e0e58273bf06c0868093092c9f41a51c22e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,47,94,14,88,39,59,240,108,8,104,9,48,146,201,244,26,81,194,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
