That broody nature and tough-guy exterior aren't fooling me one bit.\r\nI know everything about him. I listen in on his most personal phone calls. I read his mail before he does. I even know what his mother got him for Christmas last year.\r\nYou're the man of my dreams, Paxton Vance. You just don't know it yet.\r\nBut don't worry, I'll remind you. I'm here to give you everything you need, before you know you need it.\r\nSo don't get defensive because I take a challenge seriously. You have to open up to someone, and that someone is me.\r\nBesides, you can't stay Mr. Mysterious forever. Why play the game if you never want to win?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:451c4a5ab8a1094498229347572a023d58297474","amp;dn":"+Mr.+Mysterious+%28The+Mister+Series+Book+4%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"451c4a5ab8a1094498229347572a023d58297474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,28,74,90,184,161,9,68,152,34,147,71,87,42,2,61,88,41,116,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
