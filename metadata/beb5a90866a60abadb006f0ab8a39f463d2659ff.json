Excellent singles &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and kick-off manifesto rocker &quot;New Church&quot; set the bar high, but dark and groovy &quot;Livin' on Livin'&quot;, glammy &quot;Li'l Boys Play with Dolls&quot;, &quot;Question of Temperature&quot;, and the band's best rock deep cuts, &quot;Holy War&quot; and &quot;Portobello&quot;, all meet the challenge.
