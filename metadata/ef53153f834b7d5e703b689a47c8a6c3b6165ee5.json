It grew out of the Agency's Operation BLACKBIRD and was a forerunner to the Agency's MKULTRA. \n\n\n\n\n\nProject ARTICHOKE also known as Operation ARTICHOKE was run by the CIA's \nOffice of Scientific Intelligence. The project went deeper into \ninterrogation methods studied in the CIA's Project BLUEBIRD. ARTICHOKE \noffensive mind control techniques experiments attempted to induce amnesia \nand highly suggestive states in its subjects. ARTICHOKE focused on the \nuse of hypnosis, forced morphine addiction, forced morphine addiction \nwithdrawal, along with other drugs, chemicals, and techniques.\nThe main focus of the program was summarized in a January 1952 CIA memo, \n&quot;Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our \nbidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, \nsuch as self-preservation?&quot;\nOne program experiment attempted to see if it was possible to produce a \n&quot;Manchurian Candidate.&quot; In Richard CondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1959 novel &quot;The Manchurian \nCandidate&quot; an American soldier, who has been placed into a hypnotic state \nby Communist forces, returns home to assassinate on command. Five years \nearlier the CIA considered the possibility. A January 1954 CIA report\nasks the question, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Can an individual of [redacted] descent be made to \nperform an act of attempted assassination involuntarily under the \ninfluence of ARTICHOKE?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef53153f834b7d5e703b689a47c8a6c3b6165ee5","amp;dn":"CIA+Project+ARTICHOKE+Interrogation+Drugs+Hypnosis+1954.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef53153f834b7d5e703b689a47c8a6c3b6165ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,83,21,63,131,75,125,94,112,59,104,154,71,200,166,195,182,22,94,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
