We'll start by learning how to access mocha from inside of After Effects. We'll get familiar with the interface and the different tools we'll be using throughout the course. We'll learn how powerful mocha is by tracking a simple planar surface. \n\nNext, we'll import tracking data into After Effects and apply it to a layer in our project and learn how to make adjustments. We'll also track more problematic surfaces and figure out what to do to overcome these issues. \n\nBy the end of this course you'll know how to track easy and difficult surfaces in mocha and export that tracking and shape data for use in your After Effects project.\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction and course overview\n\n2.Getting familiar with the tools and interface\n\n3.Tracking planar surfaces\n\n4.Adjusting our track\n\n5.Exporting data to After Effects\n\n6.Tracking problematic surfaces\n\n7.Overcoming obstacles in your tracking\n\n8.Exporting multiple tracking information into After Effects\n\n9.Using mocha to create shape data and manual keying\n\n10.How to export shape data to After Effects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f44f98c9d6e1d1068093661e2504c5c7536592c","amp;dn":"%5BDigital+Tutors%5D+Your+First+Day+Using+mocha+in+After+Effects+Tut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f44f98c9d6e1d1068093661e2504c5c7536592c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,68,249,140,157,110,29,16,104,9,54,97,226,80,76,92,117,54,89,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
