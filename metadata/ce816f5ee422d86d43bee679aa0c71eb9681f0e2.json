Clear explanations;\nabundant MRI, CT, MRA, and MRV images; full-color photographs and illustrations; hundreds of review questions; and supplemental online resources combine to provide a sound anatomical base for integrating neurobiological and clinical concepts. In thus applying neuroanatomy clinically, the atlas ensures student preparedness for exams and for rotations. This authoritative approachÃ¢â‚¬â€combined with such salutary features as full-color stained sections, extensive cranial nerve cross-referencing, and systems neurobiology coverageÃ¢â‚¬â€sustains the legacy of this revolutionary teaching and learning tool as the neuroanatomy atlas.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New and hallmark features elucidate neuroanatomy and systems neurobiology for course success!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ NEW! Chapter on Herniation Syndromes decodes the elegant relationship between brain injury and resulting deficit.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ NEW! Clinical information integrated throughout the text is screened in blue for quick identification on the page.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ NEW! Enhanced clinical images emphasize clarity and detail like never before, including full-color images replacing many in black and white, higher-resolution brain scans, and reprocessed spinal cord and brainstem images.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ MRIs complement full-color anatomical illustrations, allowing for visualization of structures both as they appear to the unaided eye and on imaging studies.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Unique, full-color illustrations integrate clinical images of representative lesions with the corresponding deficits highlighted.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full-color stained sections facilitate the easy identification of anatomical features.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Dozens of pathway drawings superimposed over MRIs connect structure with function of neural pathways.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce816f5ee422d86d43bee679aa0c71eb9681f0e2","amp;dn":"Neuroanatomy+in+Clinical+Context%2C+9E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce816f5ee422d86d43bee679aa0c71eb9681f0e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,129,111,94,228,34,216,109,67,190,230,121,170,12,113,235,150,129,240,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
