His best known song is &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;.\n\nAccording to Charlie Daniels, &quot;Carl Perkins' songs personified the rockabilly era, and Carl Perkins' sound personifies the rockabilly sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed.&quot; Perkins' songs were recorded by artists (and friends) as influential as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Johnny Cash, which further cemented his place in the history of popular music.\n\nCalled &quot;the King of Rockabilly&quot;, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll, the Rockabilly, and the Nashville Songwriters Halls of Fame; and was a Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipient.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Perkins#Discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Perkins#Discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
