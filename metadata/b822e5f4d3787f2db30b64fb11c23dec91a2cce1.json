Presenting the vast subject of organic synthesis in terms of the introduction and interconversion of all known functional groups, COFGT-II provides a unique information source documenting all methods of efficiently performing a particular transformation. Organised by the functional group formed, COFGT-II consists of 144 specialist reviews, written by leading scientists who evaluate and summarise the methods available for each functional group transformation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b822e5f4d3787f2db30b64fb11c23dec91a2cce1","amp;dn":"Comprehensive+Organic+Functional+Group+Transformations+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b822e5f4d3787f2db30b64fb11c23dec91a2cce1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,34,229,244,211,120,127,45,179,11,100,251,17,194,61,236,145,162,204,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
