Abrams | 1988 | Pdf | English | 160 pages | ISBN:10 0810913771 | 22.8 MB\n\nPhotographer Michael George, born in Wales, has lived and worked in New York City since the early 1970s. This book comprises more than 150 of his stunning photographs of New York which provide a panorama of the everyday city, from cafe tables nestled at the feet of the financial district's glass towers, to the strobe-lit walls of the Palladium disco, to flower-bedecked upper Madison Avenue and the chic new boutiquery of stolid old Columbus Avenue. George takes his camera inside museums, to the Debutante Ball at the Waldorf, to SoHo art openings and to Greenwich Village eateries. His is a picture of the city that none other than a longtime resident could get. In addition to his superb photos, he has written a loving and informed introduction to the city, offering keen observations on its growth, its problems, and its ongoing joys. His lively and pertinent captions to the photographs add another dimension. For native and tourist alike, this is a book that shows New York as the vital, bustling center of work and play that it is","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:019350a426ee133b9f1dc1c97b3a1bff2ddc508e","amp;dn":"New+York+Today+%281988+Photography+Travel%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"019350a426ee133b9f1dc1c97b3a1bff2ddc508e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,147,80,164,38,238,19,59,159,29,193,201,123,58,27,255,45,220,80,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
