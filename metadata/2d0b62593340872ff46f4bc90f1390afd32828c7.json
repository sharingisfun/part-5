The refresh has transformed the guidance from providing a great service to being the most innovative and best in class. At the same time, the interface between old and new approaches is seamless so that users do not have to reinvent the wheel when adopting it. V3 allows users to build on the successes of V2 but take IT service management even further.\n\nIn general, V3 makes the link between ITIL\\&amp;#039;s best practice and business benefits both clearer and stronger. The main development is that V3 takes a lifecycle approach to guidance, as opposed to organising according to IT delivery sectors. ITIL is now based on a core of five titles:\n- Service Strategy\n- Service Design\n- Service Transition\n- Service Operation\n- Continual Service Improvement\n\nThe changes reflect the way ITSM has matured over the past decades. For example:\n- Where V2 talked about Business and IT Alignment, V3 emphasises Business and IT integration.\n- Where V2 talked about Value Chain Management, V3 emphasises Value Network Integration.\n- Where V2 talked about Linear Service Catalogues, V3 emphasises Dynamic Service Portfolios.\n- Where V2 talked about Collection of integrated processes, V3 emphasises Holistic Service Management Lifecycle.\n\nThe Official Introduction to the ITIL - Service Lifecycle\n\n\n\nPublisher: TSO and OGC\nPress date: August 31st 2007\nISBN10: 0113310617\nISBN13: 978-0-1133-1061-6\nPages: 238\n\nKey features:\nThe main body introduces the five main titles with an introduction and clearly laid out summary of objectives, practice, key elements, roles and responsibilities and service performance.\nGives an overview of the guidance specific to each stage of the lifecycle.\nEach chapter concludes with key messages and lessons, showing how the Introduction relates to the full library with its deeper levels of practice expertise and structured application.\n\nBrief Table of Contents:\n===============\nIntroduction\nCore Guidance Topics\nThe ITIL Service Management Lifecycle - Core of Practice\nService Strategy - Governance and Decision-Making\nService Design - Building Structural Service Integrity\nService Transition - Prepairing for Change\nService Operation\nContinual Service Improvement\nComplementary Guidance\nThe ITIL Service Management Model\n\nFile size: 13 MB\nFile type: PDF (Scanned)\n\n\nService Design\n\n\n\nPublisher: TSO and OGC\nPress date: May 30th 2007\nISBN10: 0113310471\nISBN13: 978-0-1133-1047-0\nPages: 334\n\nIn order to meet the current and future business requirements, Service Design provides guidance on the production and maintenance of IT policies, architectures, and documents for the design of appropriate and innovative IT infrastructure service solutions and processes.\n\nEach of the five core titles shares a consistent structure; the various practice elements are easily navigated and extensively cross-referenced.
