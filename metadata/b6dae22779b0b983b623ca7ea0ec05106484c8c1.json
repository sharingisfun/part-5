Disco sucks, right? Disco means Uptown, party hearty, no social conscience, no meaning beyond cocaine, champagne, Halston, Gucci and Fi-o-rucci. Disco sucked all the groove, the sweat, the dirt, the very blackness out of funk, and left it a limpid and pallid vanilla music. And like a lot of modern musical theories of course, it's also complete bollocks. \r\nDisco didn't kill the funk - it just changed and mutated with the times. Everyone from Fatback and Funkadelic to the New Minister of Super Heavy Funk JB himself saw which way the wind was biowing and got themselves out on the disco dancefloor.\r\nAnd, while they may have been cashing in on the new trends to elongate their careers, the results were by and large pretty, well, funky.\r\n\r\nSo this album is here to celebrate the disco kings and queens (and hey, there were a lot of queens) who kept the faith with the funk under those mirrorballs. The popstars and producers, the session journeymen and just plain non-entities who understood that just because a record is stomping along at a healthy 125 beats per minute, it's no barrrier to kicking it in &quot;on the one&quot;. ...\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                   Frank Tope\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/4Hsfj8Q.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
