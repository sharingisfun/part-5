These drive image files can then be stored in a variety\nof places, including various removable media such as CD-R(W)/DVD, Iomega Zip or Jazz disks, etc. \n \nR-Drive Image restores the images on the original disks, on any other partitions or even on a hard drive's\nfree space on the fly. To restore system and other locked partitions R-Drive Image is switched to the pseudo-graphic\nmode directly from Windows or bootable version created by the utility is launched from CD disc or diskettes. \n \nUsing R-Drive Image, you can completely and rapidly restore your system after heavy data loss caused\nby an operating system crash, virus attack or hardware failure. You can also use R-Drive Image for mass\nsystem deployment when you need to setup many identical computers. In other words, you can manually\nsetup one system only, create an image of the system, and then deploy it on all other computers,\nsaving your time and costs. If you need to restore only certain files from a disk image, you can connect that\nimage as a virtual disk and copy files directly from the image using Windows Explorer or any other file utility.\n \nR-Drive Image is one of the best backup and disaster recovery solutions to prevent losing\nyour data after a fatal system failure.
