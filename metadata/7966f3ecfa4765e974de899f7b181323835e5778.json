Return to Ithaka \n\n  As one of the most popular groups to emerge in the post-grunge alternative rock aftermath, Weezer received equal amounts of criticism and praise for their hook-heavy guitar pop. Drawing from the heavy power pop of arena rockers like Cheap Trick and the angular guitar leads of the Pixies, Weezer leavened their melodies with doses of '70s metal learned from bands like Kiss. What truly set the band apart, though, was their geekiness. None of the members of Weezer, especially leader Rivers Cuomo, were conventional rockers: they were kids who holed up in their garage, playing along with their favorite records when they weren't studying or watching TV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7966f3ecfa4765e974de899f7b181323835e5778","amp;dn":"Weezer+-+Everything+Will+Be+Alright+in+the+End+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7966f3ecfa4765e974de899f7b181323835e5778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,102,243,236,250,71,101,233,116,222,137,159,123,24,19,35,131,94,87,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
