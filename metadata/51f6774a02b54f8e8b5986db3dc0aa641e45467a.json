She has contributed songs to movie soundtracks and has teamed with musicians such as Roy Orbison, Tony Bennett, Elton John and Anne Murray. Lang is also known for being a vegan[3], and an animal rights, gay rights and Tibetan human rights activist.

This was the first release outside of Canada. Angel with a Lariat is a country recording, influenced by rock and rockabilly and possibly even new wave[citation needed].
