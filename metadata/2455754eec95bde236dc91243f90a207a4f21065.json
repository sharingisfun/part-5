In this particular instance the book contains hundreds of images from the movie set up partially like an illustrated book and partially like a comic book. Some pages have text sections with images, some pages have images with word bubbles and some pages have all three.\n\nSince I imagine Hayao Miyazaki's name will bring a few people to this while searching, I think it only fair that I mention that the text in this book is 100% English language.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2455754eec95bde236dc91243f90a207a4f21065","amp;dn":"Hayao+Miyazaki+-+Spirited+Away+Picture+Book+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2455754eec95bde236dc91243f90a207a4f21065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,85,117,78,236,149,189,226,54,220,145,36,63,144,162,7,164,242,16,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
