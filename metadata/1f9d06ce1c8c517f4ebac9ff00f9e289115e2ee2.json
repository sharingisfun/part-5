THE ESSENTIAL JOHNNY ... Full DescriptionCASH solves that problem, tying together the various eras of Cash's career on a generous 35-track, two-disc set. Accordingly, this anthology is damn near definitive. From the raw, sparse rockabilly flavor of &quot;Hey Porter&quot; and &quot;Get Rhythm&quot; to the gospel roots of &quot;Where You There (When They Crucified My Lord,&quot; the first disc moves neatly through Cash's early career. \n\nDisc two documents Cash's expansion into ever more varied stylistic avenues. Countrified covers of Bob Dylan (&quot;It Ain't Me Babe&quot;) and Tim Hardin (&quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;) exemplify his fascination with folk-rock. The socially conscious &quot;Man in Black&quot; and the patriotic &quot;Ragged Old Flag&quot; perfectly display the ostensibly conflicting sides of this complex artist's sensibilities. Album-closer &quot;The Wanderer&quot; finds Cash collaborating with U2, filling his role as icon to a whole new generation of artists. \n\nRecorded between May 1955 and May 1993. \n\nAll tracks have been digitally remastered. \n\n2cds-Commemorates Johnny's 70th B-Day (Feb.26,2002) \n\nCompilation producers: Nick Shaffran, Nedra Olds-Neal. \n\nRecording information: Dublin, Ireland (05/??/1955-03/05/1993); Folsom Prison, Sacramento, CA (05/??/1955-03/05/1993); Hendersonville, TN (05/??/1955-03/05/1993); Hollywood, CA (05/??/1955-03/05/1993); Los Angeles, CA (05/??/1955-03/05/1993); Memphis, TN (05/??/1955-03/05/1993); Nashville, TN (05/??/1955-03/05/1993); San Quentin Prison, CA (05/??/1955-03/05/1993). \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f9d06ce1c8c517f4ebac9ff00f9e289115e2ee2","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+The+Essential+Johnny+Cash+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f9d06ce1c8c517f4ebac9ff00f9e289115e2ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,157,6,206,28,140,81,127,78,186,201,255,0,249,226,137,17,94,46,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
