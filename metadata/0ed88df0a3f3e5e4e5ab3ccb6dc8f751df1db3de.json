Until the night she disappeared with her best friend, Cassie, everyone said Sam had it all-popularity, wealth, and a dream boyfriend.\n\nSam has resurfaced, but she has no recollection of who she was or what happened to her that night. As she tries to piece together her life from before, she realizes it's one she no longer wants any part of. The old Sam took &quot;mean girl&quot; to a whole new level, and it's clear she and Cassie were more like best enemies. Sam is pretty sure that losing her memories is like winning the lottery. She's getting a second chance at being a better daughter, sister, and friend, and she's falling hard for Carson Ortiz, a boy who has always looked out for her-even if the old Sam treated him like trash.\n\nBut Cassie is still missing, and the facts about what happened to her that night aren't just buried deep inside of Sam's memory-someone else knows, someone who wants to make sure Sam stays quiet. All Sam wants is the truth, and if she can unlock her clouded memories of that fateful night, she can finally move on. But what if not remembering is the only thing keeping Sam alive?\n\n**\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGr 7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10Ã¢â‚¬â€From the very first page, readers are thrust into the mind of confused amnesiac Samantha, who finds herself at the center of the mysterious disappearance of her best friend, Cassie. The protagonist was the last person known to see Cassie alive; the problem is that the teen remembers nothing of their last night together and, for that matter, nothing of her life at all. With the help of her brother and the compelling and handsome Carson Ortiz, Samantha figures out that the old Sam, the one she can't remember, might be one that's worth forgetting. Popular, powerful, and mean, she and her best frenemy Cassie had ruled the school and put down anyone in their path. In the search for someone who would have wanted to cause the two of them harm, she realizes that the list could be a long one. Someone clearly knows things no one else could about that night and leaves threatening notes telling the narrator to stop searching for the truth. Readers are led to wonder if Samantha's gnawing suspicion that she might be the culprit herself is right or perhaps if her developing romance with Carson is really a romance with Cassie's killer. The action-filled plot and the shocking revelation of the murderer's true identity will leave fans of suspense and mystery thoroughly satisfied.Ã¢â‚¬â€Joanna Sondheim, Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School, New York City\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nAmnesia complicates an otherwise standard murder mystery in ArmentroutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s psychological thriller about a missing girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return and her efforts to recover her lost memories. SamanthaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memory loss is so total that not only canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t she remember what happened the night she and best friend Cassie vanished, or how she turned up alone in the state forest, but she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recognize anything from her former life. Her wealthy family, hot boyfriend, and popular friends are strangers, none of whom she is sure she can trust, especially after she learns what the old Samantha was like: a quintessential mean girl who used her money and influence to bully others. Redemption isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy, and once CassieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body is found, Samantha is left wondering if her old self was capable of murder. Sinister flashes of memory and other threatening notes help set an ominous tone, though the finale is a bit anticlimactic. Some new, supportive friendships and a steamy romance with Carson, the groundskeeperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, also provide a balance to the suspense.
