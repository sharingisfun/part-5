The time it takes to make a decision. That's all that lies between settling for 'Whatever' ... or insisting on 'Whatever it takes.' 3 Seconds shows how to unleash the inner resources that can move you to a whole new level of success. It comes down to six predictable impulses that most of us automatically accept without a second thought. You can replace them with new impulses that lead toward impact and significance. For instance, it takes Three Seconds to ... Disown Your Helplessness: The First Impulse: 'There's nothing I can do about it.' \n\nThe Second Impulse: 'I can't do everything, but I can do something.' Quit Stewing and Start Doing: The First Impulse: 'Someday I'm going to do that.' The Second Impulse: 'I'm diving in ... starting today.' Fuel Your Passion: The First Impulse: 'I'll do what happens to come my way.' The Second Impulse: 'I'll do what I'm designed to do.' Inhale ... exhale ... the difference of your lifetime can begin in the space of a single breath. The decision is yours. Start today.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dedd25a40ad19580edb07c4f3344ad6323ee4cd","amp;dn":"3+Seconds%3A+The+Power+of+Thinking+Twice-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dedd25a40ad19580edb07c4f3344ad6323ee4cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,237,210,90,64,173,25,88,14,219,7,196,243,52,74,214,50,62,228,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
