This will let mod makers share new monsters, level pieces, and texture packs and have them seamlessly blend with other content of the same kind from other mods in the style of how games like Skyrim do modding.\n\nI'm really excited to see how this feature can be used to add tons of new content into Delver, all from different authors working on different things. If anyone wants more information on this system, check out the pinned discussion forum post in the Modding subforum for Delver.\n\nFeatures!\n\n    Many mods active at the same time.\n    Revamped level editor!\n    Spike traps, and spike pits.\n    New puzzle dungeon tiles.\n    Flies have found the dungeon a good place to hang out","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33e83ff5ea0751e7dd88bb3f6094e6d8020ac87b","amp;dn":"Delver+-+Update+8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33e83ff5ea0751e7dd88bb3f6094e6d8020ac87b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,232,63,245,234,7,81,231,221,136,187,63,96,148,230,216,2,10,200,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
