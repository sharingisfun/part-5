It hailed the return of the band's most successful line-up of Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie and Stevie Nicks, who had not released an album together since 1987's Tango in the Night. It was the first Fleetwood Mac release to top the US album charts since 1982's Mirage. This was the last Fleetwood Mac album to feature Christine McVie, who departed the group a year after the album's release. \r\nDebuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 199,000, The Dance became the fifth best-selling live album of all time in the United States, selling a million\r\ncopies within eight weeks, spending more than seven months within the top 40, and\r\neventually selling over 5 million copies there. The 44 date tour grossed $36 million.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbum Info:\r\n\r\nArtist : Fleetwood Mac\r\nAlbum : The Dance\r\nGenre : Classic Rock\r\nYear : 1997\r\nLabel : Reprise Records\r\nTracks : 17\r\nPlaytime : 01:19:08\r\nSize : 182.01 MB\r\nCodec : MPEG 1 Layer III / FhG / 320 kbps\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\n01.
