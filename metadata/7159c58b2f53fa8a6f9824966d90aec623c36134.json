But now he and his wife Carly are being forced to come to terms with the fact that eight-year-old SusieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time is running out. Then they receive an unexpected gift: startling new research into the fundamental secrets of life that could be the miracle theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been looking for.\n\nWhen Richard is arrested on a trumped-up charge of having stolen the data, he takes his family and runs, seeking out a retired special-forces operative and old friend to help dig up the truth behind the controversial experiments. Determined to either save SusieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life or die trying, the Dramans plunge into a bloody conflict between two powerful factions vying for control of a discovery that could change the face of humanity.\n\nEPUB AND MOBI.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7159c58b2f53fa8a6f9824966d90aec623c36134","amp;dn":"The+Immortalists+By+Kyle+Mills","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7159c58b2f53fa8a6f9824966d90aec623c36134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,89,197,139,47,83,250,138,111,152,36,150,109,144,174,198,35,195,97,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
