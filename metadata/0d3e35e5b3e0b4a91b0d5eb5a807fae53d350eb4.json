Before Sex and the City and ViagraTM, America relied on Masters and Johnson to teach us everything we needed to know about what goes on in the bedroom. Convincing hundreds of men and women to shed their clothes and copulate, the pair were the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top experts on love and intimacy. Highlighting interviews with the notoriously private Masters and the ambitious Johnson, critically acclaimed biographer Thomas Maier shows how this unusual team changed the way we all thought about, talked about, and engaged in sex while they simultaneously tried to make sense of their own relationship. Entertaining, revealing, and beautifully told, Masters of Sex sheds light on the eternal mysteries of desire, intimacy, and the American psyche.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d3e35e5b3e0b4a91b0d5eb5a807fae53d350eb4","amp;dn":"Masters+Of+Sex+-+The+Life+And+Times+Of+William+Masters+And+Virgi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d3e35e5b3e0b4a91b0d5eb5a807fae53d350eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,62,53,229,179,224,180,169,27,13,94,181,168,7,250,229,61,53,14,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
