From simple template and plate-type jigs to complex channel and box-type tooling, this newly revised edition features more than 500 illustrations of tools and applications to spur readers to success. \n\n All-new sections on assembly tools, handling tools, and catalog reading enable readers to develop important skills. Specific examples of various jigs and commercially available fixtures also appear to guide readers in developing their understanding of how design principles, as well as the latest design and manufacturing technologies, are being applied in the construction of jigs and fixtures today. As in past editions, heavy emphasis is placed on the economics of jigs and fixtures, including methods and formulas for use in estimating workholder costs. A solid background in industrial processes, as well as machine shop technology, is assumed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://buspic.com/img/file13879945021.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://buspic.com/img/file13879945021.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1af9b4c1ca73e6a1b2d7c51995f2a13c09a174ed","amp;dn":"Jig+and+Fixture+Design%2C+5E+%5BENG%5D+%5B.pdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1af9b4c1ca73e6a1b2d7c51995f2a13c09a174ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,249,180,193,202,115,230,161,178,215,197,25,149,242,161,60,9,161,116,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
