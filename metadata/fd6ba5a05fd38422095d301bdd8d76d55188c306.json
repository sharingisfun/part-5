In fact Colour By Numbers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ regarded by most as their best album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is here almost in its entirety, with only two songs missing. Colour By Numbers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the track - wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t included on the album but did feature as a b-side. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a particularly strong song worthy of its inclusion on this set (it is also a bonus track on the 2003 reissue of the album).\n\nDebut Kissing To Be Clever is similarly well represented, with seven out of the nine tracks included, plus the non-album single (in many territories) Time (Clock of the Heart).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd6ba5a05fd38422095d301bdd8d76d55188c306","amp;dn":"Culture+Club+-+The+Hits+Collection+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd6ba5a05fd38422095d301bdd8d76d55188c306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,107,165,160,95,211,132,34,9,93,48,27,221,141,118,213,81,136,195,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
