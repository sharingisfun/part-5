Although delighted to be home and determined to maintain her hard-won inner peace, Babe now faces a host of outside forces seemingly intent on derailing her path to positive change. Not only is she being trailed by an anonymous stalker, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also reunited with the love of her life, a relationship that she cannot seem to stop self-sabotaging.\n\nBabeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newfound spirituality, coupled with her faith in the universe and its messages, leads her all over the world: shoulder dancing in Paris, tripping out in Amsterdam, and hooking up in the Mediterranean, only to land her back in New York City, forced to choose between a man who is perfect in every way (except for one small detail) and a man who could be The One if only he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t drive Babe to utter insanity.\n\nUnapologetic and uproarious, Psychos is the send-up of the seasonÃ¢â‚¬â€already as timeless as vintage Dior.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3e42be770ad85f8bcba293b4269f5a4f4755719","amp;dn":"Psychos+A+White+Girl+Problems+Book+%28Babe+Walker%29+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3e42be770ad85f8bcba293b4269f5a4f4755719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,228,43,231,112,173,133,248,188,186,41,59,66,105,245,164,244,117,87,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
