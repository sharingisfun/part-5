Best known for playing Tuvok on Star Trek: Voyager, he had directed one episode of that series. The series was shot in Star Trek: New Voyages sets in Port Henry, New York. Scenes were also shot around the Los Angeles, California area, including at Vasquez Rocks, a popular site for Star Trek location footage. Scenes set at the Vulcan Science Academy were filmed in the San Fernando Valley. Principal photography began July 12, 2006 and finished in October 2006.\n\nReturning Star Trek cast and crew\nThe mini-series starred Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov, and Grace Lee Whitney as Janice Rand from the original series. Alan Ruck also reprised his role as Captain John Harriman from Star Trek Generations, and Tim Russ appeared as Tuvok. Other regular Star Trek actors appeared in new roles, including Garrett Wang and Ethan Phillips (who respectively played Harry Kim and Neelix from Voyager), J. G. Hertzler, Cirroc Lofton and Chase Masterson (Martok, Jake Sisko and Leeta from DS9) and Gary Graham (Ambassador Soval from Enterprise). The series was written by DS9 writers Jack Trevino and Ethan H. Calk. Douglas Knapp, the director of photography, had worked on Voyager.\n\nCo-writer Jack Trevino explained how so many actors from the series had been willing to participate: &quot;Trek actors have a special relationship with their fans... they regarded the project, not only as the ultimate thank you to Gene Roddenberry and the original stars of Trek, but as a thank you to [the fans] who supported the series over the last 40 years.&quot; Executive producer Douglas Conway had tried to assemble more of the original series cast, but when George Takei (Sulu) was not available, this led to the idea of including Ruck's character as captain.\n\nTwo actors from Star Trek: New Voyages, James Cawley and Jeff Quinn, also featured\n\nDirector:Tim Russ\nWriters:Ethan H.
