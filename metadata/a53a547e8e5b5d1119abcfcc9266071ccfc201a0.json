Some of them were rather cool and even if we wouldn't use them as the future songsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ basis, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love to share them with you all. On the other hand, we are ready to book the studio to start recording our third LP, and this is a ton of money. Inspired by the likes from Swans to Eggnogg, we decided to upload some cuts for you on BandCamp, accompanied by the nice cover done by our long-time collaborator Yura. Also spot the tracklist, there are no actual song names, since these ones are NOT songs and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not going to play them on the shows.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53a547e8e5b5d1119abcfcc9266071ccfc201a0","amp;dn":"Stoned+Jesus+-+The+Seeds+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53a547e8e5b5d1119abcfcc9266071ccfc201a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,58,84,126,142,91,93,17,25,171,207,204,146,102,7,28,207,194,1,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
