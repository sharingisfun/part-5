She followed this with a four-volume work, THE MASTER OF HESTVIKEN (1925-27), also cast in medieval Norway and dealing with similar historical and personal themes.\n\nAt the end of the 1930s she commenced work on a new historical novel set in 18th century Scandinavia.  Only the first volume, MADAME DORTHEA (1939) was published.  HAPPY TIMES IN NORWAY, a memoir of life in that country before the Nazi occupation, features a particularly moving and powerful preface about the simplicity and hardiness of Norway and its people, with a vow that it will return thus after the evil of Nazism is &quot;swept clean.&quot;\n\nUndset's greatest gift -- her ability to evoke an immediately arresting and credible sense of life being lived -- was as remarkable in her shorter modern stories as in her panoramic historical novels.  FOUR STORIES brings together tales of people living in Christiana, now Oslo, in 1900.  THE UNKNOWN SIGRID UNDSET is an anthology of early works, including two short stories (&quot;Simonsen&quot; and &quot;Tjodolf&quot;); a novel, JENNY (1911), which tells the story of a disenchanted painter; and an assortment of letters written between 1900 and 1922, all of which provide a window into Undset's views on women's sexuality, the relationship between motherhood and art, and the complex dynamic between women and men.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB/MOBI or PDF format as indicated:\n\n* THE BURNING BUSH (Knopf, 1932).
