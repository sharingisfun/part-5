DANGEROUS. ADDICTIVE.\n\nAbby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Walking One-Night Stand.\n\nTravis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby wantsÃ¢â‚¬â€and needsÃ¢â‚¬â€to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by AbbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in TravisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.\n\nBook 2 - Walking Disaster by Jamie McGuire (April 2nd 2013)\n\nFinally, the highly anticipated follow-up to the New York Times bestseller Beautiful Disaster. Can you love someone too much?\nTravis Maddox learned two things from his mother before she died: Love hard. Fight harder.\n\nIn Walking Disaster, the life of Travis is full of fast women, underground gambling, and violence. But just when he thinks he is invincible, Abby Abernathy brings him to his knees.\n\nEvery story has two sides. In Beautiful Disaster, Abby had her say. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to see the story through TravisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes. \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4e14eff87ef3c3c5fd329a7e19907e2b9855fa","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Series+%281-2%29+by+Jamie+McGuire+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4e14eff87ef3c3c5fd329a7e19907e2b9855fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,78,20,239,248,126,243,195,197,253,50,154,126,25,144,126,43,152,85,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
