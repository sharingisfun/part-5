It will be published quarterly, thus each subspecialty will be reviewed biannually.\nGiven the multiplicity of medical publications already available, why is a new series needed? Consider that the half-life of medical knowledge is estimated to be around 5 years. Moreover, it can be as long as 8 years between the first description of a medical innovation in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and publication in a medical textbook. A series that narrows this time span between journal and textbook would provide a more rapid and efficient transfer of medical knowledge into clinical practice, and enhance care of our patients","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f67c089080f36b5d6a57ae9b43ec77a05d6d53","amp;dn":"Cornea+and+External+Eye+Disease+%28Essentials+in+Ophthalmology%29+%7BN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f67c089080f36b5d6a57ae9b43ec77a05d6d53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,246,124,8,144,128,243,107,93,106,87,174,155,67,236,119,160,93,109,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
