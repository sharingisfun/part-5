Costello chose to hire Geoff Emerick, who engineered all of the Beatles' most ambitious records, to produce Imperial Bedroom, which indicates what it sounds like -- it's traditional pop with a post-Sgt. Pepper production. Essentially, the songs on Imperial Bedroom are an extension of Costello's jazz and pop infatuations on Trust. Costello's music is complex and intricate, yet it flows so smoothly, it's easy to miss the bitter, brutal lyrics. The interweaving layers of &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; and the whirlwind intro are the most overtly dark sounds on the record, with most of the album given over to the orchestrated, melancholy torch songs and pop singles. Never once do Costello &amp; the Attractions deliver a rock &amp; roll song -- the album is all about sonic detail, from the accordion on &quot;The Long Honeymoon&quot; to the lilting strings on &quot;Town Cryer.&quot; Of course, the detail and the ornate arrangements immediately peg Imperial Bedroom as Costello's most ambitious album, but that doesn't mean it's his absolute masterpiece. Imperial Bedroom remains one of Costello's essential records because it is the culmination of his ambitions and desires -- it's where he proves that he can play with the big boys, both as a songwriter and a record-maker. It may not have been a commercial blockbuster, but it certainly earned the respect of legions of musicians and critics who would have previously disdained such a punk rocker. And, perhaps, that's also the reason that he abandoned this immaculately crafted style of work on his next album, Punch the Clock. \n\n.: Locandina :.\n\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1-1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Beyond Belief 2:34\n1-2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Tears Before Bedtime 3:02\n1-3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Shabby Doll 4:48\n1-4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions The Long Honeymoon 4:15\n1-5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Man Out Of Time 5:27\n1-6 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Almost Blue 2:50\n1-7 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions ...And In Every Home 3:23\n1-8 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions The Loved Ones 2:48\n1-9 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Human Hands 2:43\n1-10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Kid About It 2:45\n1-11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Little Savage 2:37\n1-12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Boy With A Problem 2:13\n1-13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Pidgin English 3:58\n1-14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions You Little Fool 3:11\n1-15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Town Cryer 4:16\nBonus Disc\n2-1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions The Land Of Give And Take (Early Version Of Beyond Belief) 3:05\n2-2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Tears Before Bedtime (Alternate Version) 3:03\n2-3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Man Out Of Time (Alternate Version) 3:43\n2-4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Human Hands (Early Version) 2:44\n2-5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Kid About It (Alternate Version) 3:18\n2-6 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Little Savage (Alternate Version) 3:07\n2-7 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions You Little Fool (Alternate Version) 2:59\n2-8 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Town Cryer (Fast Version) 2:15\n2-9 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Little Goody Two Shoes (Alternate Version) 3:10\n2-10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions The Town Where Time Stood Still (Alternate Version) 2:57\n2-11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions ...And In Every Home (Rehearsal) 3:12\n2-12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions I Turn Around 2:10\n2-13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions From Head To Toe 2:35\n2-14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions The World Of Broken Hearts 3:03\n2-15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Night Time 2:55\n2-16 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions Really Mystified 2:05\n2-17 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions The Stamping Ground 3:10\n2-18 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello Shabby Doll (Demo) 4:21\n2-19 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello Man Out Of Time (Demo) 3:26\n2-20 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello You Little Fool (Demo) 3:11\n2-21 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello Town Cryer (Demo) 3:03\n2-22 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello Seconds Of Pleasure (Demo) 3:19\n2-23 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Costello Imperial Bedroom 2:48","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b60fec98d87bb7b558c5853ea50bbc6810f0b8a","amp;dn":"Elvis+Costello+-+Imperial+Bedroom+%5BMP3+192%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b60fec98d87bb7b558c5853ea50bbc6810f0b8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,96,254,201,141,135,187,123,85,140,88,83,234,80,187,198,129,15,11,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
