In actuality, the premise of Tales bears a much stronger resemblance to the 1939 film Only Angels Have Wings and the 1944 film To Have and Have Not. Creator Donald P. Bellisario tried to get the series commissioned since the late 1970s, but executives felt that audiences wouldn't be interested in an adventure series set in the 1930s. It was the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark that changed their minds. The series featured the romance of early aviation, exotic locales and cliff-hanging action.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:849da669ead339be45bcf20250be55d06d19f09f","amp;dn":"Tales.of.the.Gold.Monkey.%28Complete.Series%29.DVDRip.H264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"849da669ead339be45bcf20250be55d06d19f09f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,157,166,105,234,211,57,190,69,188,242,2,80,190,85,208,109,25,240,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
