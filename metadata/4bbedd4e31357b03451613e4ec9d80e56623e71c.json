The meaning of the band's name is best explained in an interview from Century Media Records website. Lazare states &quot;Solefald is an old Norse word for sunset. We 'stole' it from a painting by the Norwegian artist Theodor Kittelsen. His two paintings 'Soleglad' and 'Solefald' portrays the cycle of being, and we found it to be a very fitting idea for our band.&quot; Cornelius also states &quot;'Solefald' means literally 'the fall of the sun', or just 'sunset'; the way we spell it is Danish, from the 19th century.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n01.
