But Dresden isn't a private detective, looking for a murderer - he's a wizard, with the ability to interact with the magical world around our own, and to see that there's much more to this case than a simple animal attack. As Dresden begins to hunt for clues to figure out who is really behind this crime, he finds himself next on the victims listÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n============================================\n\nThe Dresden Files - Welcome To The Jungle 02 - May 2008\n\n35 Pages | HQ PDF | English | 21 MB\n\nCats don't hunt in packs... and that's one of the reasons Dresden knows he's up against something magical when a whole group of escaped leopards, tigers and lions attacks him.

Pulling out a trick CSI only wishes it had, Harry does his hocus-pocus on the hair, creating a psychic trail that leads him back to the owner of the hair. But when he arrives, it doesn't take him long to regret coming.\n\n============================================\n\nThe Dresden Files - Welcome To The Jungle 04 - July 2008 \n\n32 Pages | HQ PDF | English | 24 MB\n\nHarry has finally uncovered the real murderer at the Lincoln Park Zoo.
