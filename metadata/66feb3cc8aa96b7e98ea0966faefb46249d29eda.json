Through spirited Q&amp;A sessions with Zen master Jun Po Denis Kelly Roshi, The Heart of Zen takes a gradual, step-by-step approach to what has become a vexing problem in spiritual circles.\n\nWhat is missing is integration. If awakening truly transforms every part of the life of a person, where are we getting stuck? How can negative emotions like anger, shame, envy, and jealousy continue to arise? How do our relative egos relate to the Zen teaching of Emptiness, and what does this mean for our intimate relationships, our emotional bodies, our views of the world and its problems?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66feb3cc8aa96b7e98ea0966faefb46249d29eda","amp;dn":"The+Heart+of+Zen%3A+Enlightenment%2C+Emotional+Maturity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66feb3cc8aa96b7e98ea0966faefb46249d29eda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,254,179,204,138,169,107,126,152,234,9,102,250,239,180,98,73,210,158,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
