Within a narrative framework that imagines consciousness itself to be evolving, Entheogen documents the emergence of techno-shamanism in the post-modern world that frames the following questions: How can a renewal of ancient initiatory rites of passage alleviate our ecological crisis? What do trance dancing and festivals celebrating unbridled artistic expression speak to in our collective psyche? How do we re-invent ourselves in a disenchanted world from which God has long ago withdrawn? Entheogen invites the viewer to consider that the answers to these questions lie within the consciousness of each and every human being, and are accessible if only we give ourselves permission to awaken to the divine within.\n\nLanguage: English\nFile Type: AVI - XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nFile Size: 702 MB\nFile Duration: 1:09:55\nKBPS: 1199\nFPS: 29.97\nResolution: 640 x 480\nAudio: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 -- 48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c22a1f88cf886261e688ecf1fc5d831e13edcccf","amp;dn":"Entheogen%3A+Awakening+the+Divine+Within","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c22a1f88cf886261e688ecf1fc5d831e13edcccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,42,31,136,207,136,98,97,230,136,236,241,252,93,131,30,19,237,204,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
