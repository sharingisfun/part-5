For more than 25 years, copies of Timing for Animation have been sitting dog-eared and spine-split on desks and workstations around the world wherever animation is produced.

Originally written in 1981 (and newly revised in 2009) this slim volume presents a thorough analysis of the many kinds of timing issues one encounters in producing a narrative style animated film. Timing on Bar Sheets, Movement and Caricature, Newton's Laws of Motion, Objects Thrown Through the Air, Timing a Slow Action, Timing a Fast Action, Timing to Suggest Weight and Force... these are only a few of the many chapters included. A thoroughly compiled manual, it's an old and current favourite.&quot;--Animation World Network\nAbout the Author\nKnown as the &quot;father of animation&quot; and formerly of Halas and Batchelor Animation unit, John produced over 2000 animations, including the legendary &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and the award winning &quot;Dilemma&quot;.
