The widespread adoption of agile methods has brought the need for effective testing into the limelight, and agile projects have transformed the role of testers.\n\nMuch of a tester's function, however, remains largely misunderstood. What is the true role of a tester? Do agile teams actually need members with QA backgrounds? What does it really mean to be an &quot;agile tester?&quot; \n\nTwo of the industry's most experienced agile testing practitioners and consultants, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory, have teamed up to bring you the definitive answers to these questions and many others.\n\nIn Agile Testing, Crispin and Gregory define agile testing and illustrate the testerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role with examples from real agile teams. They teach you how to use the agile testing quadrants to identify what testing is needed, who should do it, and what tools might help.\n\nThe book chronicles an agile software development iteration from the viewpoint of a tester and explains the seven key success factors of agile testing.\n\n\n\nReaders will come away from this book understanding:\n\n\n\nHow to get testers engaged in agile development\n\nWhere testers and QA managers fit on an agile team\n\nWhat to look for when hiring an agile tester\n\nHow to transition from a traditional cycle to agile development\n\nHow to complete testing activities in short iterations\n\nHow to use tests to successfully guide development\n\nHow to overcome barriers to test automation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b0f0850e3eb1e2f3f48f6a5ddf31e156e65df03","amp;dn":"Agile+Testing%3A+A+Practical+Guide+for+Testers+and+Agile+Teams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b0f0850e3eb1e2f3f48f6a5ddf31e156e65df03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,15,8,80,227,235,30,47,63,72,246,165,221,243,30,21,110,101,223,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
