You'll learn about the Red-Green-Refactor procedure, how to write unit tests, and how to use them as executable documentation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:063a20e137f7e0d27eea649d944164016003a562","amp;dn":"Java+Test-Driven+Development+%28DjShay12%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"063a20e137f7e0d27eea649d944164016003a562","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,58,32,225,55,247,224,210,126,234,100,157,148,65,100,1,96,3,165,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
