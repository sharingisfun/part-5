Knightfall started almost immediately after &quot;The Funeral For a Friend&quot; storyline in the Superman books. It can be seen that during the break out at Arkham Asylum, Batman was wearing a black arm band with the S-shield engraved on it as well as Robin whilst cutting Jean-Paul Valley&amp;#039;s hair. The two stories involved DC Comics&amp;#039; most prominent characters in what some regarded as bold, daring stories and others as stunts designed to sell extra comics through sensationalism (although then-President Jenette Kahn denied this on the Superman: Doomsday feature.). Similar stories followed for Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Green Arrow.\n\nKnightfall was, in terms of number of titles and issues it encompassed and the duration of the storyline, the most ambitious Batman story ever at the time it was published. Its success paved the way for other year-or-longer crossovers, such as &quot;No Man&amp;#039;s Land.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c935679d8c4dd0eb1973c8689c58d12fbb17491","amp;dn":"Batman%3A+Knightfall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c935679d8c4dd0eb1973c8689c58d12fbb17491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,147,86,121,216,196,221,14,177,151,60,134,137,197,141,18,251,177,116,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
