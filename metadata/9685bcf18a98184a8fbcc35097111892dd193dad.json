He derives the primacy of his ethics from the experience of the encounter with the Other.  For Levinas, the irreducible relation, the epiphany, of the face-to-face, the encounter with another, is a privileged phenomenon in which the other person's proximity and distance are both strongly felt: &quot;The Other precisely reveals himself in his alterity not in a shock negating the I, but as the primordial phenomenon of gentleness.&quot;  To meet the Other is to have the idea of Infinity.\n\nHe had a major impact on the young Jacques Derrida, a fellow French Jew whose seminal &quot;Writing and Difference&quot; contains an essay, &quot;Violence and Metaphysics&quot;, on Levinas.  Derrida also delivered a eulogy at Levinas's funeral, later published as &quot;Adieu ÃƒÂ  Emmanuel Levinas&quot;, an appreciation and exploration of Levinas' moral philosophy.  In a memorial essay for Levinas, Jean-Luc Marion claimed that &quot;If one defines a great philosopher as someone without whom philosophy would not have been what it is, then in France there are two great philosophers of the twentieth century: Bergson and Levinas.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format:\n\n* ALTERITY AND TRANSCENDENCE (Athlone Press, 1999).
