Though things are going to be a bit different this time around.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I won't be posting shows early like I did before. I will leave that up to my buddy mc_gregor who is doing a great job. \r\nIt will more likely be an end of that week post or when able.\r\n\r\nAs for Opie &amp; Jim Norton, I may post the complete month of August, not sure yet. But if I do, after that it will be the same end of that week post or when able. \r\n\r\n\r\nI won't be posting The Artie Quitter Podcast for I canceled my sub just before August, for I'm about 4 months behind &amp; saw no reason to keep paying, when I can sub again later once I've finished the episodes that I got &amp; get a few month worth of shows then","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c64274c1459f86af4e65b1f4f48c85262de6edd","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+Shows+AUG+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c64274c1459f86af4e65b1f4f48c85262de6edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,100,39,76,20,89,248,106,244,230,91,31,79,72,200,82,98,222,110,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
