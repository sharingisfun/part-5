CCNA ICND2 Essential Training covers the second part of the exam that networking candidates need to take to earn their Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing and Switching (CCNA RS) certification. The ICND2 exam validates a candidate's ability to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot medium-sized routed and switched networks. Author Lazaro Diaz covers topics including:â€¨â€¨\r\n\tâ€¢\tLAN switching\r\n\tâ€¢\tThe Spanning-Tree Protocol\r\n\tâ€¢\tBacking up and restoring Cisco devices\r\n\tâ€¢\tIP services (FHRP, syslog, GLBP, and SNMP v2 and v3) \r\n\tâ€¢\tConfiguring EIGRP\r\n\tâ€¢\tIP routing via OSPF\r\n\tâ€¢\tSetting up wide area networks (WANs) with PPP and frame relay\r\n\tâ€¢\tUnderstanding virtual private networks (VPNs) \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Packet Tracer and cabling, you'll learn how to combine these protocols and technologies to create redundant switch networks that are stable and fast. Along the way, Laz provides practical examples of networking challenges that you'll encounter in the exam and in real life.\r\n\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f636a20c26bf63c16f17d1a8d326e0a16a86c737","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+CCNA+ICND2+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f636a20c26bf63c16f17d1a8d326e0a16a86c737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,54,162,12,38,191,99,193,111,23,209,168,211,38,224,161,106,134,199,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
