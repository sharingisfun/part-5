Hiding in the shadows, pretending to be part of the United States government, its power is beyond measure.\n\nControl of this organization has just been lost and the future of the nation thrust into peril.\n\nWhen the five candidates being considered to head this mysterious agency suddenly go missing, covert counterterrorism operative Scot Harvath is summoned to Washington and set loose on the most dangerous chase ever to playout on American soil.\n\nBut as the candidates begin turning up murdered, the chase becomes an all-too-public spectacle, with every indicator suggesting that the plot has its roots in a shadowy American cabal founded in the 1700s.\n\nWith the United States on the verge of collapse, Harvath must untangle a web of conspiracy centuries in the making and head off the greatest threat America has ever seen.\n\nThis is thriller writing at its absolute best, where the stakes have never been higher, nor the line between good and evil so hard to discern.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dd29274b13ea6fe1fff2d03596ed6cf6a0c9007","amp;dn":"Hidden+Order+by+Brad+Thor+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dd29274b13ea6fe1fff2d03596ed6cf6a0c9007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,210,146,116,177,62,166,254,31,255,45,3,89,110,214,207,106,12,144,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
