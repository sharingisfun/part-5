Seen both from the point of view of the many naval vessels on both sides and from the central headquarters of the British where the search for the super battleship was controlled. \n\nReview\n    could just watch and enjoy the movie without analyzing it. That's what movies were originally for - entertainment and enjoyment. I don't know if the special effects were great for the time or not, but they looked enough like the real thing for me. Great naval battle scenes and the acting was perfect for the times portrayed of the 1940's and the real way that military people are mostly low key in planning discussions and carrying out their duties. All very believable scenes with the flavor of the way it really was even in portions that were added to entertain (when history takes a back seat to entertainment). Kenneth More showed his versatility in excelling in such a serious part and Dana Wynter very professional. I don't know why she didn't become a larger name here in the States with such pure beauty, grace and honest acting ability. By coincidence I just saw her in another movie In Love And War where she played a totally different type of part and nailed it great. Anyway, if you haven't seen Sink The Bismarck, then by all means give it a gander. It is time well spent for not only those who enjoy naval movies, but good drama films as well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a57a6c1e98857c7487d151af677bad6f5829b6e","amp;dn":"Sink+The+Bismark+%5B1960%5D+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a57a6c1e98857c7487d151af677bad6f5829b6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,87,166,193,233,136,87,199,72,125,21,26,246,119,186,214,245,130,155,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
