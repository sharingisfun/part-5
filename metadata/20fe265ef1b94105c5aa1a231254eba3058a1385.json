Miles Davis and music of the 20th Century would never sound the same again. Bitches Brew soon went gold . . . Miles' first. \n\nHe had created a new sound yet again . . . an eerie, nocturnal, and very funky sound. A dark, simmering Brew that could only have come from the mind of Miles Davis . . . a synthesis of Sly Stone, James Brown, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Miles' world. \n\nBitches Brew is certainly one of the most important recordings ever made . . . and definitely one of the most unexpected and controversial. It has entered the pantheon of myth. . . somewhat like the music of Robert Johnson. \n\nTHE COMPLETE BITCHES BREW SESSIONS, a comprehensive 4-CD Set, presents 9 Previously Unissued Tracks (90 minutes of new music) in pristine remixed sound and elegant packaging. \n\nIt is the complete story of these revolutionary and historic sessions.\n\n\nTHE PACKAGE IN DETAIL \n4-CD Super Deluxe package with the same packaging standards as the 3-time Grammy winning Miles Davis/Gil Evans and Complete Quintet sets. \n\nCovers the period between August 1969 and February 1970, and includes material previously from Bitches Brew, Big Fun, Circle In The Round, and Live-Evil. \n\n9 Previously Unreleased Tracks - 1/3 OF THE MUSIC IN THIS BOX IS NEWLY-DISCOVERED! \n\n148 page booklet featuring: \nA heartfelt introduction by Carlos Santana \nOverview essay by Quincy Troupe (with whom Miles wrote his autobiography) \nBrief intro by Michael Cuscuna \nDetailed session analysis by Producer Bob Belden \nDiscography of this period, \nDozens of rare &amp;amp; unpublished photos, \nElegant and simple graphic design. \n20-BIT Digitally Remixed &amp;amp; Remastered by Grammy-winning engineer Mark Wilder of Sony Music Studios, NYC. \n\nCOLLECTIVE PERSONNEL:\nMiles Davis \nWayne Shorter , Bennie Maupin, Steve Grossman - saxophones\nHerbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea - keyboards \nJohn McLaughlin - guitar \nRon Carter, Dave Holland, Harvey Brooks - bass \nLenny White, Jack DeJohnette, Billy Cobham - drums \nAirto Moreira, Don Alias, Jumma Santos - percussion\nKhalil Balakrishna - sitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20fe265ef1b94105c5aa1a231254eba3058a1385","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis-4+CD+Set-The+Complete+Bitches+Brew+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20fe265ef1b94105c5aa1a231254eba3058a1385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,254,38,94,241,185,65,5,197,170,26,35,18,84,235,163,5,138,19,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
