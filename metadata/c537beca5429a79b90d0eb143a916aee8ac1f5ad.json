March 1958; Manchester), a respected DJ who played in\nQuando Quango, booked several early shows by the Smiths, and signed\nHappy Mondays and James to Factory Records while working A&amp;R\nduring the mid-'80s. Pickering later moved from Factory to the dance\nlabel Deconstruction, where he signed acts in addition to recording\nmaterial with his own band, T-Coy. He formed M People in 1990 with\nHeather Small (b. Jan. 20, 1965; London) and former Orange Juice\nmember Paul Heard (b. Oct. 5, 1960; London).\n\nThe group signed to DeConstruction in 1991, and released the single\n&quot;Colour My Life&quot; that May. Second single &quot;How Can I Love You More,&quot;\npropelled by Small's deep soul vocals, became a U.K. hit and spawned\nthe 1992 album Northern Soul. Later that year M People issued the remix\nwork Northern Soul Extended, and then began a blockbuster 1993 with\n&quot;Movin' on Up.&quot; The album Elegant Slumming was also a hit, earning the\ngroup a BRIT award as Best UK Dance Act. The following year, Bizarre\nFruit continued M People's success, and was followed in 1997 by Fresco.\nDuring the next two years, a pair of collections appeared: Classic M\nPeople and Testify.~ John Bush, All Music Guide..\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n  1.
