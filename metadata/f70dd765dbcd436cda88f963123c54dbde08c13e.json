It was recorded at Bruce Ryan Soundstage at Idyllwild Arts Academy Idyllwild in May 2011.\n\nThis album grew out of a small project that was planned for 2009 convention of the International Society of Bassists.\n\nThe society wished to honour Thompson's friend and frequent collaborator Danny Thompson, and commissioned Richard Thompson to write a piece to be performed at the convention and which would highlight Danny Thompson's skills. What Richard Thompson eventually delivered was a collection of thematically linked songs with narration in between the songs.\n\nThe theme is a &quot;talent contest&quot; in the afterlife between the souls of recently deceased people. Each soul sings a song revealing key elements of their lives, including a crucial sin or vanity. After each performance by a soul the Keeper Of Souls and his assistants sing or speak in reply.\n\nThe album was not made available in retail stores. It could be ordered from Thompson's own on-line store or purchased at live shows.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.richardthompson-music.com/cabaretofsouls.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.richardthompson-music.com/cabaretofsouls.asp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Richard Thompson - Cabaret Of Souls\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Richard Thompson\nAlbum................: Cabaret Of Souls\nGenre................: Folk Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2012\nRipper...............:  &amp; \nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3, APE v2,000\n\nIncluded.............: NFO, M3U\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.  - Prelude                                              [02:13]\n   2.  - Overture                                             [02:13]\n   3.  - Song Of The Keepers                                  [03:03]\n   4.  - Whipping On                                          [01:30]\n   5.  - The Linnett                                          [03:16]\n   6.  - I really Do Love A Waltz                             [01:17]\n   7.  - I Must Lie Down                                      [03:21]\n   8.  - Gluttony Considered                                  [01:03]\n   9.  - Clyde Smythe                                         [05:06]\n  10.  - The Critic Critiqued                                 [01:18]\n  11.  - I Get Younger                                        [03:23]\n  12.  - The Parchment Grows Thin                             [00:55]\n  13.  - Auldie Riggs                                         [03:18]\n  14.  - Auldie RIggs Dance                                   [01:17]\n  15.  - Mr. RIggs Appreciated                                [01:17]\n  16.  - Her Eyes Not Mine                                    [03:14]\n  17.  - From The Inside Out                                  [00:35]\n  18.  - Breaking Down The Walls                              [04:28]\n  19.  - Will You Wash Away The Blood                         [02:53]\n  20.  - My Dave                                              [03:50]\n  21.  - The Gangsters Moll                                   [00:40]\n  22.  - Run Judas Run                                        [05:12]\n  23.  - It Came With A Whisper                               [00:38]\n  24.  - I Want The World                                     [03:06]\n  25.  - She Had It All                                       [00:34]\n  26.  - Bosom Of The Lord                                    [04:49]\n  27.  - Hot Place For Hypocrites                             [00:36]\n  28.  - One More Breath                                      [03:31]\n  29.  - The Regrets And Reflects                             [01:10]\n  30.  - Whipping Off                                         [01:39]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 01:11:38\nTotal Size...........: 169.50 MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f70dd765dbcd436cda88f963123c54dbde08c13e","amp;dn":"Richard+Thompson+-+Cabaret+Of+Souls+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f70dd765dbcd436cda88f963123c54dbde08c13e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,13,215,101,219,205,67,108,218,136,249,99,18,60,84,219,222,8,193,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
