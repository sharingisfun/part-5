Blake\nPublished: 2012\nPublisher: BenBella Books\nASIN: B008O7D8I2\nFormat: Retail Epub and Mobi\nReader Required:\nEpub- Adobe Digital Editions, Calibre, MoonReader for Android\nMobi- Kindle app, Calibre, MoonReader for Android\n\nHow many self-help books are written by authors whose biggest success is selling self-help books? New York Times bestseller Three Simple Steps is different.\n\nDespite stock market crashes, dot-com busts, and the specter of recession, the author started a virtual company from home, using a few thousand dollars of his savings. A few years later, without ever hiring an employee or leaving his home office, he sold it for more than $100 million. As the economy slipped into another free fall, he did this again with a company in a different field. He accomplished this through no particular genius. Rather, he studied the habits of the many successful men and women who preceded him, and developed three simple rules that, if followed diligently, virtually ensure success. Using them first to escape poverty, then to achieve a life of adventures, he finally turned them toward financial independence.\n\nWritten in a straightforward and no-nonsense style, Three Simple Steps shows you how to take back control of your destiny and reshape your mind for increased creativity, serenity and achievement. While building on the wisdom of great thinkers and accomplished individuals from East and West, Three Simple Steps isn't a new age text or guide to esoteric fulfillment. Rather, it's a practical guide to real-life achievement by a pragmatic businessman who attributes his incredible successes to these very simple ideas. Three Simple Steps, a 2013 Small Business Book Awards winner, is a must-read guide for everyone who wants to achieve more, live better and be happier.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c689c456ce0b1d5e66216a330e0745309a31b8f0","amp;dn":"Three+Simple+Steps%2C+A+Map+to+Success+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c689c456ce0b1d5e66216a330e0745309a31b8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,137,196,86,206,11,29,94,102,33,106,51,14,7,69,48,154,49,184,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
