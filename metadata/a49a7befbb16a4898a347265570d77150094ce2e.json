Special emphasis is devoted to the United States and the impact of the war on American society. The role of women and blacks in the labor force and armed services, industrial mobilization, and propaganda are just a few of the topics explored. The author's examination of the origins of the Cold War, the superpower arms race, and the division of Europe shows how World War II helped shape the world in which we now live. Based on the most up-to-date scholarship, this volume is written for the general reader and for use in courses on World War II and on recent American history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a49a7befbb16a4898a347265570d77150094ce2e","amp;dn":"The+United+States+and+World+War+II+%28History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a49a7befbb16a4898a347265570d77150094ce2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,154,123,239,187,22,164,137,138,52,114,101,87,13,119,21,0,148,206,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
