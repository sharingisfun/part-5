Each word or phrase that we use today had a beginningÃ¢â‚¬â€and a story behind it. In fact, many current words date back to ancient times. Some keep the same meaning from Day One. Other words, however, evolve over timeÃ¢â‚¬â€taking on new characteristics, new meanings, and fascinating tales of people, places, and times long ago.\n\nIn a Word collects dozens of these tales and follows words through their many changes. Did you know...\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ that your belt Ã¢â‚¬Å“buckleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has more to do with the hat on your head than keeping your pants up?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ that a Ã¢â‚¬Å“bakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dozenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has more to do with theft than an extra doughnut? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ that Ã¢â‚¬Å“cometsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were thought to be stars with long hair? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sandwichÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ you ate for lunch comes from British royalty? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“planetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are named for the gods of ancient Rome?\n\nWith thousands of interesting details, In a Word unravel word origins from all over the world. Each entry or phrase is also placed into a subject category, making it easier to discover its meaning. Humorous illustrations showcase many of the wordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ visual connections. Altogether, In a Word is a useful and fun journey into the heart of our language.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82053a4c37ec54d7e5c57f921aa94f187dcc238e","amp;dn":"In+a+Word%3A+750+Words+and+Their+Fascinating+Stories+and+Origins+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82053a4c37ec54d7e5c57f921aa94f187dcc238e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,5,58,76,55,236,84,215,229,197,127,146,26,169,79,24,125,204,35,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
