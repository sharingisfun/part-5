This version comes new and improved. It was created as a retail version of Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3, and comes pretty much OTB (at least, it looks that way). \n\nTried a load of new ideas with this which is why it's been so long in coming. Should be snappier and boot in less that a minute (26 seconds on my machine). Majority of the small bugs have been fixed, and as usual there are guides linked in the torrent if you need help. \n\nThe .exe is an SFX archive, double-click to extract. Works with Player, Workstation and Fusion, both old and new versions. Watch the Setup Guide to set it all up properly (it'll help you to no end).\n\nIf you wanna follow my work/releases;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://souldevteam.net/blog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://souldevteam.net/blog&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ef75b2c0153d3672478a14485d9479548ce48ec","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Lion+10.7.3+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ef75b2c0153d3672478a14485d9479548ce48ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,247,91,44,1,83,211,103,36,120,161,68,133,217,71,149,72,206,72,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
