The Polish title could be literally translated &quot;coincidence,&quot; an appropriate if possibly ironic title for a three-part film about a young man whose life course appears to be solely determined by his ability or inability to catch a train. Kieslowski has his doubts about such coincidences, for he described the film as &quot;a description of the powers which meddle with our fate, which push us one way or another&quot; (Kieslowski on Kieslowski, ed. Danusia Stok 113). Incidentally, this film inspired Peter Howitt&amp;#039;s film Sliding Doors (1998) and Tom Tykwer&amp;#039;s Run Lola Run (1998), but to my mind, Kieslowski&amp;#039;s is a superior film. The original tends to be the best, and he is a true original.\n\n---\n\nMy rip.\n\n--\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name:                                      Krzystof Kieslowski - Blind Chance.avi                     \nFile Size (in bytes):                           732,026,880                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             33          \nPreload (in ms):                                504       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Aligned         \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  xvid                        \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            01:53:58                \nFrame Count:                                    204934             \nFrame Width (pixels):                           608                  \nFrame Height (pixels):                          384                               \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.583                     \nFrames Per Second:                              30                   \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           741                 \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                        MPEG-4                   \nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                          B-VOP     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                                   \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            106                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            VBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2           \n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
