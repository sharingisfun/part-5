In the mainstream, Amy Winehouse won hearts and moved units by re-configuring the girl group sound till it reflected present-day debauchery. Just below the radar, artists like the Budos Band, the Pipettes and Sharon Jones &amp; the Dap-Kings kept fresh the sound of funk. California band Orgone belongs squarely in that latter camp ? their music is terrifically unfussy, big slabs of grizzled R&amp;B, greasy as fatback and thick as a very particular kind of smoke. At their best, they recall the majesty of Sly &amp; the Family Stone; opening track &quot;Who Knows Who&quot; is all bleary horns and broken-heart vocals, &quot;It&amp;#039;s What You Do&quot; is a tight, itchy jam. There&amp;#039;s still a riot goin&amp;#039; on, and Orgone is at the front of the crowd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d77514049d135e2cc16b6f3c57001ea08210eb13","amp;dn":"Orgone+-+%5B2007%5D+The+Killion+Floor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d77514049d135e2cc16b6f3c57001ea08210eb13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,117,20,4,157,19,94,44,193,107,111,60,87,0,30,160,130,16,235,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
