They originally formed in Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S. in 1964.[1] They went through several musical phases in their career, starting out with a purist jazz sound, becoming practitioners of R&amp;B and funk, progressing to a smooth disco ensemble, and ended the successful period of their career producing pop/R&amp;B crossovers. They have sold over 70 million albums worldwide. The group's main members over the years included brothers Robert Bell (known as &quot;Kool&quot;) on bass (born October 8, 1950, Youngstown, Ohio) and Ronald Bell on tenor saxophone (born November 1, 1951, Youngstown, Ohio); George Brown on drums (born January 5, 1949); Robert Mickens on trumpet; Dennis Thomas on alto saxophone; Claydes Charles Smith on guitar (born September 6, 1948; died June 20, 2006), and Rick Westfield on keyboards. The Bell brothers' father was an acquaintance of Thelonious Monk and the brothers were friends with Leon Thomas.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
