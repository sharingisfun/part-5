Cathy Glass is about to find out. From number 1 bestselling author of Damaged comes a harrowing and moving memoir about tiny Harrison, left in CathyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s care, and the potentially fatal family secret of his beginnings.\n\nWhen Cathy is first asked to foster one-day old Harrison her only concern is if she will remember how to look after a baby. But upon collecting Harrison from the hospital, Cathy realises she has more to worry than she thought when she discovers that his background is shrouded in secrecy.\n\nShe isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t told why Harrison is in foster care and his social worker says only a few are aware of his very existence, and if his whereabouts became known his life, and that of his parents, could be in danger. Cathy tries to put her worries aside as she looks after Harrison, a beautiful baby, who is alert and engaging. Cathy and her children quickly bond with Harrison although they know that, inevitably, he will eventually be adopted.\n\nBut when a woman Cathy doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know starts appearing in the street outside her house acting suspiciously, Cathy fears for her own familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safety and demands some answers from HarrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social worker. The social worker tells Cathy a little but what she says is very disturbing . How is this woman connected to Harrison and can she answer the questions that will affect HarrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whole life?\n\n\nAbout the Author\nCathy has been a foster carer for over 20 years, during which time she has looked after more than 70 children, of all ages and backgrounds. Cathy runs training courses on fostering for her local Social Services, and helps draft new fostering procedures and guidelines. She has three teenage children of her own; one of whom was adopted after a long-term foster placement. The name Cathy Glass is a pseudonym.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3337c85d22eadd9e7fc9c3caaa8233d92ea98d40","amp;dn":"A+Baby%27s+Cry+-+Cathy+Glass%2CPdf%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3337c85d22eadd9e7fc9c3caaa8233d92ea98d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,55,200,93,34,234,221,158,127,201,195,202,170,130,51,217,46,169,141,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
