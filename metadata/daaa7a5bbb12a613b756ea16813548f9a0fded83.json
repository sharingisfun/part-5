Originally a single-disc compilation, a two-disc edition was released in 2004.\nSingle Cd Review - While there have been a bunch of Toto budget-line compilations over the years, 2003's The Essential Toto is the first high-profile hits collection since 1990's Past to Present 1977-1990. At 14 songs, The Essential is one track longer than that compilation, but it shares eight cuts with Past to Present, which, of course, are all the big hits: &quot;Africa,&quot; &quot;Hold the Line,&quot; &quot;Georgy Porgy,&quot; &quot;Rosanna,&quot; &quot;I Won't Hold You Back,&quot; &quot;99,&quot; and &quot;Pamela.&quot; What differentiates the two compilations, then, is that The Essential boasts a much better remastering and a better selection of songs, including the single &quot;Make Believe&quot; and a good selection of album tracks from their peak period, like &quot;I'll Supply the Love.&quot; While this is missing some hits, they're minor ones that won't be missed by most listeners -- &quot;Live for Today,&quot; &quot;Afraid of Love,&quot; &quot;Loves in the Night,&quot; &quot;Waiting for Your Love,&quot; &quot;Stranger in Town,&quot; and &quot;Holyanna&quot; -- and what's here is very good, an accurate representation of Toto at their best, making this their best compilation to date.\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Rosanna\n[02] Stop Loving You\n[03] Hold The Line\n[04] Caught In The Balance\n[05] 99 [Album Version]\n[06] The Other Side\n[07] I Won't Hold You Back\n[08] Africa\n[09] Don't Chain My Heart\n[10] 2 Hearts\n[11] Waiting For Your Love\n[12] Make Believe\n[13] Goodbye Elenore\n[14] Home Of The Brave\n[15] How Does It Feel\n[16] The Road Goes On\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:15m:35s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] I Will Remember\n[02] Georgy Porgy\n[03] Just Can't Get To You\n[04] Pamela\n[05] Baby He's Your Man\n[06] I'll Supply The Love\n[07] Holyanna\n[08] The Turning Point\n[09] If You Belong To Me\n[10] Can You Hear What I'm Saying\n[11] Slipped Away\n[12] Dave's Gone Skiing\n[13] Without Your Love\n[14] Stranger In Town\n[15] Till The End\n[16] I'll Be Over You\n\nCD02 Play Time - 01h:13m:53s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:29m:28s:\nTotal File Size....................... 354mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
