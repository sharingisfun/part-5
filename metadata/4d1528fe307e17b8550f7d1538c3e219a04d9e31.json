Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi (John Francis Bongiovi, Jr.), guitarist Richie Sambora, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, as well as current bassist Hugh McDonald.[1] The band's lineup has remained mostly static during their history, the only exception being the departure of Alec John Such in 1994, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald. The band became known for writing several rock anthems and achieved widespread recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet, released in 1986. After touring and recording non-stop during the late 1980s, the band went on hiatus after the New Jersey Tour in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith. Their 2000 single &quot;It's My Life&quot;, which followed a second hiatus, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. Bon Jovi has been known to use different styles in their music, which has included country for their 2007 album Lost Highway. Their latest album, The Circle, was released on November 10, 2009 in the United States.\n\nThroughout their career, the band have released eleven studio albums, three compilation albums and one live album, and have sold 130 million records worldwide.[2] They have performed more than 2,600 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans,[3] and were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006.[4] The band was also honored with the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004.[5] Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.[6][7] Bon Jovi was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, but did not make it. \n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 2010\n\n\nGreatest Hits and Greatest Hits: The Ultimate Collection are compilation albums released October 29, 2010 by hard rock band Bon Jovi. Greatest Hits is a single disc, spanning the entire career of the band as well as two new songs, including a new single, &quot;What Do You Got?&quot;, and &quot;No Apologies&quot;.\n\nGreatest Hits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Ultimate Collection is a double disc collection featuring the Greatest Hits album and second disc featuring fan favorites along with two more new songs: &quot;This Is Love, This Is Life&quot; and &quot;The More Things Change&quot;. The four new songs were written specifically for this new compilation project. The font used for the band's name on the album's cover is a return to the Bon Jovi logo used from 1985 to 1988.\n\nIn addition to the four new songs, at least one song was included from each Bon Jovi studio album (with the exceptions of 7800Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Fahrenheit and Bounce, although a bonus track from 7800 Fahrenheit is included on international versions); two tracks from Bon Jovi's previous compilation album Cross Road were included as well. Also, one song, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, was added despite being a release from Jon Bon Jovi's solo album of the same name.\n\nBon Jovi performed a special, live streaming concert for the Live on Letterman web series on November 9, 2010. The band performed a significant part of the album during the hour long set.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; \n2.\t&quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; \n3.\t&quot;It's My Life&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Bad Medicine&quot; \n7.\t&quot;We Weren't Born to Follow&quot; \n8.\t&quot;I'll Be There for You&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Who Says You Can't Go Home&quot; (country version with Jennifer Nettles)\n12.\t&quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; (radio edit)\n13.\t&quot;Always&quot; \n14.\t&quot;Runaway&quot; \n15.\t&quot;What Do You Got?&quot; \n16.\t&quot;No Apologies&quot;\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1528fe307e17b8550f7d1538c3e219a04d9e31","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+Greatest+Hits+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1528fe307e17b8550f7d1538c3e219a04d9e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,21,40,254,48,126,23,184,85,15,125,21,56,195,226,25,160,77,158,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
