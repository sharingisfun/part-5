Hallelujah. \nGeorge Szell (1897-1970), one of the greatest conductors of the twentieth century, was born in Budapest, studied piano, conducting, and composing in Vienna and Berlin, and learned his craft as a conductor in the opera houses of Europe. World War II brought him to America, where he conducted at the Metropolitan Opera (1942-1946), and finally led the Cleveland Orchestra from 1946 until his death, &quot;molding the ensemble into one of the world's finest,&quot; as the Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music notes. Szell and the Cleveland became as distinguished a collaboration as Toscanini and the NBC or Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic. Szell brought the Cleveland Orchestra to such a peak of perfection that many good judges considered the Cleveland under Szell the premier conductor/orchestra team in the world.\nIn the late 1950s and the 1960s, the procession of marvelous Szell recordings with the Cleveland Orchestra that came rolling out of Severance Hall became for discerning music lovers a benchmark of excellence; many of them have never been surpassed. (My own list of these nonpareils would include the complete Beethoven symphonies, the complete Beethoven piano concertos with Leon Fleisher, the Beethoven overtures, the Mahler Fourth Symphony, Strauss's Don Quixote, the Wagner orchestral excerpts from the Ring, and the Dvorak Slavonic Dances under review here, but there are plenty of other worthy candidates from the extensive Szell/Cleveland discography). \nSzell's hallmarks as an interpreter were vigor, tension, clarity, avoidance of extremes and excess, complete lack of sentimentality, and masterful control of an orchestra that had become awesomely virtuosic and perfectly responsive in his hands. In sum, a typical Szell/Cleveland performance was taut, disciplined, bristling with energy, insight, and conviction, and immaculately played. His performances virtually never sounded routine, usually had a fresh-minted quality, and had a way of unfolding with an uncanny sense of rightness, of inevitability, conveying the impression that this is the way this music ought to be played.\nThis CD contains the complete Dvorak Slavonic Dances: the eight dances of Opus 46 and the eight dances of Opus 72; the recordings were made in 1963, 1964, and 1965. All the performances are superb, as fine as any in the catalog. The sound is OK, clear and full, certainly adequate and listenable, if not up to the best standards of today. \nThe Penguin Guide to Compact Discs, in reviewing this CD, awarded it their highest honor, a rosette, and said of it: &quot;In Szell's exuberant, elegant, and marvelously played set of the Slavonic Dances the charisma of the playing is unforgettable and, for all the racy exuberance, one senses a predominant feeling of affection and elegance. The warm acoustics of Severance Hall ensure the consistency of the orchestral sound.&quot; \nAs noted, the CD is very generously filled (74 minutes of music) and budget priced. Talk about a good deal! So what are you waiting for?
