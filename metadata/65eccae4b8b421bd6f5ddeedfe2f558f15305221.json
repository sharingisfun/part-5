RushdieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crime? Blasphemy or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Islamophobia,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as it has come to be known. Since then we have seen worldwide violent Muslim protests over cartoons, blasphemy laws in Europe, prosecutions of notable opponents of Islamic terror like Oriana Fallaci and Geert Wilders, and the demonization of courageous opponents of Islamic imperialism and terror in the West. David Horowitz and Robert Spencer describe the origins of the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“IslamophobiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a coinage of the Muslim Brotherhood and show how the Brotherhood launched a campaign, by ginning up Ã¢â‚¬Å“IslamophobiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a hate crime, to stigmatize mention of such issues as radical IslamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s violence against women and murder of homosexuals, and the constant incitement of many imams to terrorism. The authors make the case that Ã¢â‚¬Å“IslamophobiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a dagger aimed at the heart of free speech and also at the heart of our national security.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nRobert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch, a program of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and the author of eight books on Islam and jihad. Spencer is a weekly columnist for Human Events and the website Front-Page Magazine, and has led seminars on Islam and jihad for the United States Central Command, United States Army Command and General Staff College, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and the U.S. intelligence community","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65eccae4b8b421bd6f5ddeedfe2f558f15305221","amp;dn":"Islamophobia+-+Robert+Spencer%2C+David+Horowitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65eccae4b8b421bd6f5ddeedfe2f558f15305221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,236,202,228,184,180,33,189,111,93,222,237,254,47,85,143,21,48,82,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
