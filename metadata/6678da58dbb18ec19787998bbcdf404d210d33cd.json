Few pursuits are so totally dependent on an individual's internal resources. Our culture is dominated by mechanical and electronic triumphs. Against these depersonalizing forces, each artist fights for a personal life. Each is a solitary worker, making works which are addressed to the public, and receiving the benefit of identity. No matter how small the artist's garden, it is a personal plot, relatively free from the boll weevils of outward politics and the crabgrass of the computer.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6678da58dbb18ec19787998bbcdf404d210d33cd","amp;dn":"Watercolor+Energies+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6678da58dbb18ec19787998bbcdf404d210d33cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,120,218,88,219,177,142,193,151,135,153,139,188,223,64,77,33,13,51,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
