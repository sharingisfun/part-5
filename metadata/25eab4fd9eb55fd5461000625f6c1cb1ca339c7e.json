Drowning in Tears\n\n\nGary Moore (born April 4, 1952 as Robert William Gary Moore in Belfast, Northern Ireland) is acknowledged as one of the finest guitarists to have originated in Ireland.\nIn a career dating back to the 1960s he has played with bands including Thin Lizzy, Colosseum II, Greg Lake and Skid Row as well as having a successful solo career.\nMoore started performing from a young age and got his first good guitar at the age of 14.\nIn a career lasting over 30 years he has demonstrated that he is a fine musician, and his unique style of playing has adapted to very different music genres.\nHe is considered one of the best guitarists to date.\nFor blues fans, MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best recorded, live performance on video is Ã¢â‚¬Å“LIVE BLUESÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recorded in a small night club in London and was released in 1992 on VHS.\nIt is now available on DVD as well. Ã¢â‚¬Å“LIVE BLUESÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ also features two songs with B.B. King appearing on stage with Moore.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Thrill Is GoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on this recording is probably the best version of this, complete with MoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Midnight Horns, female backup singers and dueling guitars.\nMany of MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standard songs are on this 90 minute show and were mixed better than most of the studio versions of the same tunes for a very rich and full sound.\nEven MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice sounds better than it usually does in the studio. Moore does not seem interested in touring the United States.\n\nEnjoy !!!\nGenre: Rock\nSubgenre: Blues / Rock\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 176.19 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n12 files\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25eab4fd9eb55fd5461000625f6c1cb1ca339c7e","amp;dn":"Gary+Moore+-+Guitar+Mindtrip++mp3++320k+++2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25eab4fd9eb55fd5461000625f6c1cb1ca339c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,234,180,253,158,181,95,213,70,16,0,98,95,108,28,177,202,51,156,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
