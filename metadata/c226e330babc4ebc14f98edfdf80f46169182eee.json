The aforementioned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLove Thine EnemyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is just one of three slow-burn rockers on the record that bring to mind Kurt Vile fronting the Church; the other two, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Same ThingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRobin Egg Blue,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are prettier, but no less dissatisfied. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a sound and style that works well with McCombs' obvious pop sensibilities, which tend to manifest themselves most successfully when the volumeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s turned up. Elsewhere, midtempo outings like the slacker-beat poetry anthem ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Living WordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and willowy psych-folk closer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMariahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ paint vivid portraits of amiable dissolution, and the languid and bible-bleak ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTo Every Man His ChimeraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ provides the collectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest sentiment in &quot;Oh, Mary/IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m just too much to carry.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\ncd ripped by someone else\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c226e330babc4ebc14f98edfdf80f46169182eee","amp;dn":"Cass+McCombs...Humor+Risk%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c226e330babc4ebc14f98edfdf80f46169182eee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,38,227,48,186,188,78,188,20,249,142,223,223,128,244,97,105,24,46,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
