The second edition of this encyclopedia covers the new materials that have been invented or modified in recent years and updates information on basic materials as well. \r\n\r\nEncyclopedia of Materials, Parts, and Finishes, Second Edition brings together in one concise volume the most up-to-date information on materials, forms and parts, finishes, and processes utilized in the industry. There is not a handbook currently on the market that incorporates as much materials information in one volume. The coverage of materials usage extends from the breadth of military and aerospace materials to commercial (aircraft, automotive, electronics) and basic materials (wood, rubber, etc.). Each entry provides thorough, straightforward definitions along with examples of corresponding materials, parts, or finishes. Like its predecessor, this encyclopedia will be an invaluable reference that belongs on the desk of every materials scientist and engineer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43aef83de6a4e7bda001696a8d32a31ce186d816","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+and+Handbook+of+Materials%2C+Parts+and+Finishes+2nd+e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43aef83de6a4e7bda001696a8d32a31ce186d816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,174,248,61,230,164,231,189,160,1,105,106,141,50,163,28,225,134,216,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
