Common underpinnings of optics, elasticity, gravitation, relativistic fields, particle mechanics and others subjects are underlined. It attempts to extricate the notion of space currently in the physical literature from the metric connotation. It consists of a main text and a topical section. The main text introduces the mathematical ideas and serves as a guide to the topical section.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 691 pages\nPublisher: World Scientific Pub Co Inc (December 1995)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9810222327\nISBN-13: 978-9810222321\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50d8f1525753ef313213461724dc0c4fe6d6f451","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Geometrical+Physics+by+R.+Aldrovandi+and+J.+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50d8f1525753ef313213461724dc0c4fe6d6f451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,216,241,82,87,83,239,49,50,19,70,23,36,220,12,79,230,214,244,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
