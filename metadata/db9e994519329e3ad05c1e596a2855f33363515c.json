In this epic new series, pilot and former Royal Marine Arthur Williams will fly us into some of the remotest parts of our planet to find out how people survive and thrive in places only the plane can reach.\nArthur was paralysed in an accident seven years ago, but took up flying to rediscover his spirit of adventure. Now he's going to brave tiny airstrips and outrageously dangerous flying conditions, all to reach the world's most spectacular remote places.\n\n\n1)  The Himalayas \nFormer Royal Marine Arthur Williams took up flying to rediscover his spirit of adventure after he was paralysed in an accident, and in this programme he flies to some of the remotest parts of the planet to find out how people survive and thrive in places only a plane can reach. In the first episode, he heads to Nepal to see how small aircraft are transforming the nation's way of life, meeting a family whose fortunes are about to be transformed by the arrival of a major airstrip, and joining the air-traffic controllers overseeing Lukla airport's hazardous landing strip.\n\n2)  Australia and Papua \nArthur travels to the deserts of northern Australia, the islands of the Coral Sea and the jungles of Papua New Guinea, where flying is the only way in and out. He first visits a couple running a cattle station almost as big as Wales, where helicopters round up thousands of cows in a risky aerial ballet, before flying on to meet the Turner family, who bought their own desert island in the Coral Sea in 1985. Finally, Arthur joins the flying missionaries of Papua, who brave perilous jungle airstrips to bring supplies - and the word of God - to remote villages.\n\n3)  The Great Northern Wilderness \nArthur Williams heads into Canada's vast untamed wilderness, beginning by taking a 1930s flying boat upriver to the Great Bear rainforest region and viewing ancient rock art commemorating chiefs of the Kitasoo First Nations tribe. He then hitches a lift with a supply plane to Wekweeti, a Native American community in the far north that was built in the 1960s as a social experiment. Finally, Arthur tries his hand prospecting on the edge of the Arctic Circle with a man who has made $3million dollars from gold deposits he has spotted from the air.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Flying-to-the-Ends-of-the-Earth-Screen0.jpg&quot;
