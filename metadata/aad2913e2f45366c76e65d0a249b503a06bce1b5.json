More literal, more in-your-face, 70s ads sought to capture the attention of a public accustomed to blaring, to-the-point TV commercials (even VW ads, known for their witty, ironic statements and minimalist designs, lost some of their punch in the 1970s). All was not lost, though; as ads are a sign of the times, racial and ecological awareness crept into everything from cigarette to car advertisements, reminding Americans that everyday products were hip to the modern age. By the end of the decade, print ads had begun to recoup, gaining in originality and creativity as they focused on target audiences through carefully chosen placement in smaller publications. A fascinating study of mass culture dissemination in a post-hippie, television-obsessed nation, this weighty volume delivers an exhaustive and nostalgic overview of 70s advertising.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad2913e2f45366c76e65d0a249b503a06bce1b5","amp;dn":"The+Golden+Age+of+Advertising+-+The+70s+%28Graphics+Design+Ebook%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aad2913e2f45366c76e65d0a249b503a06bce1b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,210,145,62,47,69,54,108,118,230,93,10,36,155,80,58,6,188,225,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
