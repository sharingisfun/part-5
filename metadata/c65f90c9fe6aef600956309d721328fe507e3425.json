After touring with a British classical ensemble, she accepted a publishing job. Meanwhile, she sang with a series of local groups before joining the trip-hop outfit Faithless -- helmed by her older brother, the noted DJ and producer Rollo -- in 1995. The group released its debut album, Reverence, the following year. It went on to sell over five million copies worldwide, and Dido parlayed her newfound success into a solo deal with Arista Records. \n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Don't Believe In Love\n02.Quiet Times\n03.Never Want To Say It's Love\n04.Grafton Street\n05.It Comes And It Goes\n06.Look No Further\n07.Us 2 Little Gods\n08.The Day Before The Day\n09.Let's Do The Things We Normally Do\n10.Burnin' Love\n11.Northern Skies\n\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n\n01.For One Day\n02.Summer\n03.Northern Skies (Remix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c65f90c9fe6aef600956309d721328fe507e3425","amp;dn":"Dido+-+Safe+Trip+Home+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+2008+++CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c65f90c9fe6aef600956309d721328fe507e3425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,95,144,201,254,106,239,96,9,86,48,157,114,19,40,254,80,126,52,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
