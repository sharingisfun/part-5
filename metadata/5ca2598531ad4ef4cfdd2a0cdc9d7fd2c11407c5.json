Not too many of them can say their guiding force spent time in prison for attempted murder or that their debut album was released by the resolutely metal label Relapse. Not too many of them ever released an album as good as Nothing have here, and 2014's Guilty of Everything is a truly impressive debut. Equally punishing and breathtaking, the album builds from singer/guitarist Domenic Palermo's undying love of My Bloody Valentine's Loveless and adds levels of toughness and power that most shoegaze bands never could quite manage. The rhythm section definitely has a past in metal, as bassist Chris Betts and drummer Kyle Kimball pummel their instruments mightily when the songs explode. They also show some nice restraint in the quiet sections and an expansive grace in the dreamlike parts. Over the top of the steel-built bottom, the guitars of Palermo and Brandon Setta grind and intertwine, setting fires and conjuring up lush waves of painful noise and wavering atmospheric haze. Their vocals are hushed and buried in the mix, with very pretty harmonies that wouldn't be out of place on a Chapterhouse record, though bands like that didn't have nearly the weight of Nothing.
