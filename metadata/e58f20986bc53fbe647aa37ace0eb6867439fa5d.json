When the curtain rises on the first act, the cottage of Giselle and her mother Berthe are seen on one side, and opposite is seen the cottage of Duke Albrecht of Silesia, a nobleman who has disguised himself as a peasant named Loys, in order to sow a few wild oats before his marriage to Bathilde, the daughter of the Prince of Courland. Against the advice of his squire Wilfrid, Albrecht flirts with Giselle, who falls completely in love with him. Hilarion, a gamekeeper, is also in love with Giselle and warns the girl against trusting the stranger, but Giselle refuses to listen. Albrecht and Giselle dance a love duet, with Giselle picking the petals from a daisy to divine her lover's sincerity. The couple is interrupted by Giselle's mother, who, worried about her daughter's fragile health, ushers the girl into the cottage.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giselle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giselle&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Vishneva&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Vishneva&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVideo]\nResolution : 672x384\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1543 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e58f20986bc53fbe647aa37ace0eb6867439fa5d","amp;dn":"Giselle+%28Diana+Vishneva-Vladimir+Malakhov%2C+The+Tokyo+Ballet+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e58f20986bc53fbe647aa37ace0eb6867439fa5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,143,32,152,107,197,63,190,100,122,163,122,206,14,182,134,116,57,250,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
