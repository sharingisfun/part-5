This game is 18+ and in English. It\\'s a title known for it\\'s high production values and well-written story, with mecha combat and political intrigue. \n\nThis is direct sequel to Muv Luv, so I highly recommend playing the original game first. The torrent for it can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6875277/Muv_Luv_(H-Game_w__English_patch)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6875277/Muv_Luv_(H-Game_w__English_patch)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMuv-Luv Alternative takes place after the events of the original Muv-Luv. Alternative focuses on the life of Shirogane Takeru three years after Muv-Luv; Takeru wakes up believing that everything that had happened was just a dream. However, he notices something wrong: he has been sent back in time to the beginning of the events in Muv-Luv: Unlimited. But instead of letting a disaster strike again, he decides to help stop it before it even begins. The solution: helping to complete Alternative IV.\n\n\n\nPrograms needed: \n\nWinRar, available for free from here; \n                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rarlab.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rarlab.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDaemon Tools Lite, available for free from here;\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSetup instructions:\n\nIt\\'s necessary to change your system locale to Japanese. (This will not affect most programs, only non-unicode installations such as this one.)\n\nGo to Control Panel, Region and Language, and under the Administrative tab, Change System Locale. Choose Japanese(Japan) and click Apply.\n\nRestart your computer.\n\nLocate the folder where you downloaded the torrent and right click on MuvLuvAlternative.part01, then Extract Files, and Ok. This will automatically extract parts 1-9.\n\nOpen up Daemon Tools Lite and click Add Image, then find the folder you just extracted to. Select MUVLUVALTER.ISO. Right click on the image that appears in the top part of the window under Image Catalog, then select the F Drive.\n\nThe AutoPlay window will open, click Run SETUP.EXE\n\nSelect the Install option, then the left-hand option, then Next four more times.\n\nMuv Luv Alternative is now installed. Now comes the English patch.\n\nOpen the application that came with the torrent called mla-r2.\n\nClick Next, Next, and Install.\n\nCongratulations! Muv Luv Alternative is fully installed.\n\nSeed and enjoy.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c77e780d9a2ddeb001f6411270c2543caf9f312","amp;dn":"Muv+Luv+Alternative+%28H-Game+w%2F+English+patch%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c77e780d9a2ddeb001f6411270c2543caf9f312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,119,231,128,217,162,221,235,0,31,100,17,39,12,37,67,202,249,243,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
