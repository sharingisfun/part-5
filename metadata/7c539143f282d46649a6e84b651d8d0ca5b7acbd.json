Writing is hard work and can be difficult to wedge into a frenetic academic schedule. In this practical, light-hearted, and encouraging book, Paul J. Silvia explains that writing productively does not require innate skills or special traits but specific tactics and actions. Drawing examples from his own field of psychology, he shows readers how to overcome motivational roadblocks and become prolific without sacrificing evenings, weekends, and vacations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c539143f282d46649a6e84b651d8d0ca5b7acbd","amp;dn":"How+to+Write+a+Lot+A+Practical+Guide+to+Productive+Academic+Writ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c539143f282d46649a6e84b651d8d0ca5b7acbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,83,145,67,242,130,212,102,73,166,232,75,101,29,141,12,165,183,172,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
