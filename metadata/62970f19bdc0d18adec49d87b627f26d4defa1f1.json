Alabama&quot;\n2003 | English | PDF | 86 pages | 11.34 Mb\n\nOn June 19, 1864, the United States warship Kearsarge sank the Confederate raider Alabama off the coast of Cherbourg, France, in one of the most celebrated naval engagements of the American Civil War. The battle was widely reported in the illustrated press and riveted public attention on both sides of the Channel. When Kearsarge later anchored off the French resort town of Boulogne-sur-Mer it was thronged by curious visitors, one of whom was the artist Ãƒâ€°douard Manet. Although he did not witness the historic battle, Manet made a painting of it partly as an attempt to regain the respect of his colleagues after having been ridiculed for his works in the 1864 Salon. Manet's picture of the naval engagement and his portrait of the victorious Kearsarge belong to a group of his seascapes of Boulogne whose unorthodox perspective and composition would profoundly influence the course of French painting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62970f19bdc0d18adec49d87b627f26d4defa1f1","amp;dn":"Manet+and+the+American+Civil+War+-+The+Battle+of+USS+Kearsarge+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62970f19bdc0d18adec49d87b627f26d4defa1f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,151,15,25,189,192,209,138,222,196,157,135,182,39,242,109,77,239,161,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
