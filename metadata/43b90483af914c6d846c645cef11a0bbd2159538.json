Throughout all three books, there were paragraph breaks in the middle of quotations. There were also some OCR errors mostly in book 3. \n\nThis upload aims to correct all that. Please let me know if you find any errors.\n\n\nFiles included are:\nThe Hedge Knight - George R. R. Martin.epub\nThe Sworn Sword - George R. R. Martin.epub\nThe Mystery Knight - Goerge R. R. Martin.epub\n\nAnd sorry, I didn't mark out which comes first. So, it goes Hedge Knight, Sworn Sword, Mystery Knight. Shouldn't have any problems.
