While the album had a softer surface, it was only marginally less confessional than its predecessor. Underneath the sweet strings of &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; lies a broken and scared man, the jaunty &quot;Crippled Inside&quot; is a mocking assault at an acquaintance, and &quot;Imagine&quot; is a paean for peace in a world with no gods, possessions, or classes, where everyone is equal. And Lennon doesn't shy away from the hard rockers -- &quot;How Do You Sleep&quot; is a scathing attack on Paul McCartney, &quot;I Don't Want to Be a Soldier&quot; is a hypnotic antiwar song, and &quot;Give Me Some Truth&quot; is bitter hard rock. If Imagine doesn't have the thematic sweep of Plastic Ono Band, it is nevertheless a remarkable collection of songs that Lennon would never be able to better again. \n\n.: Locandina :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img111.imageshack.us/img111/7820/johnlennonimagine451434.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img111.imageshack.us/img111/7820/johnlennonimagine451434.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
