This book describes methods of drawing plane curves, beginning with conic sections (parabola, ellipse and hyperbola), and going on to cycloidal curves, spirals, glissettes, pedal curves, strophoids and so on. In general, 'envelope methods' are used. There are twenty-five full-page plates and over ninety smaller diagrams in the text. The book can be used in schools, but will also be a reference for draughtsmen and mechanical engineers. As a text on advanced plane geometry it should appeal to pure mathematicians with an interest in geometry, and to students for whom Euclidean geometry is not a principal study.\n\nthank you control+c , Now heyz up! There was a copy of this floating around which had no hyperlink Table of Contents,  \n\nAINT THAT CRUM DIDLY!?\n\nWELLL\n-----------------------\n\nTHIS file is a fully hyperlinked pdf, linked down to subsections of each and every curve chapter. \n\nSo bloody enjoy the ease of which your tablet shall prowl this.  And everyone do TRY to put THESE TYPES of uploads some more, he heyyy.cause digital should be treated easier than paper, not like a mysteriosiodeedo.\n\n!!!!!!!!\n!!!!LASTLY, do not fret when it may possibly appear that all the pages are blacked in this,( even in FOXIT  ), for this seems to be inherent in the file done by whomever I got it from.  IT works. Change view modes and stuff.
