Statistical Methods for Financial Engineering guides current and future practitioners on implementing the most useful stochastic models used in financial engineering.\nAfter introducing properties of univariate and multivariate models for asset dynamics as well as estimation techniques, the book discusses limits of the Black-Scholes model, statistical tests to verify some of its assumptions, and the challenges of dynamic hedging in discrete time. It then covers the estimation of risk and performance measures, the foundations of spot interest rate modeling, LÃƒÂ©vy processes and their financial applications, the properties and parameter estimation of GARCH models, and the importance of dependence models in hedge fund replication and other applications. It concludes with the topic of filtering and its financial applications.\nThis self-contained book offers a basic presentation of stochastic models and addresses issues related to their implementation in the financial industry. Each chapter introduces powerful and practical statistical tools necessary to implement the models. The author not only shows how to estimate parameters efficiently, but he also demonstrates, whenever possible, how to test the validity of the proposed models. Throughout the text, examples using MATLABÃ‚Â® illustrate the application of the techniques to solve real-world financial problems. MATLAB and R programs are available on the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nBlack-Scholes Model \nThe Black-Scholes Model \nDynamic Model for an Asset\nEstimation of Parameters \nEstimation Errors \nBlack-Scholes Formula\nGreeks\nEstimation of Greeks using the Broadie-Glasserman Methodologies\nMultivariate Black-Scholes Model \nBlack-Scholes Model for Several Assets\nEstimation of Parameters\nEstimation Errors\nEvaluation of Options on Several Assets\nGreeks\nDiscussion of the Black-Scholes Model\nCritiques of the Model\nSome Extensions of the Black-Scholes Model\nDiscrete Time Hedging \nOptimal Quadratic Mean Hedging\nMeasures of Risk and Performance\nMeasures of Risk\nEstimation of Measures of Risk by Monte Carlo Methods\nMeasures of Risk and the Delta-Gamma Approximation\nPerformance Measures\nModeling Interest Rates \nIntroduction \nVasicek Model\nCox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) Model\nOther Models for the Spot Rates\nLÃƒÂ©vy Models \nComplete Models \nStochastic Processes with Jumps\nLÃƒÂ©vy Processes\nExamples of LÃƒÂ©vy Processes\nChange of Distribution\nModel Implementation and Estimation of Parameters\nStochastic Volatility Models \nGARCH Models\nEstimation of Parameters\nDuan Methodology of Option Pricing\nStochastic Volatility Model of Hull-White\nStochastic Volatility Model of Heston\nCopulas and Applications \nWeak Replication of Hedge Funds \nDefault Risk\nModeling Dependence\nBivariate Copulas\nMeasures of Dependence\nMultivariate Copulas\nFamilies of Copulas\nEstimation of the Parameters of Copula Models\nTests of Independence \nTests of Goodness-of-Fit\nExample of Implementation of a Copula Model\nFiltering\nDescription of the Filtering Problem \nKalman Filter\nIMM Filter \nGeneral Filtering Problem \nComputation of the Conditional Densities \nParticle Filters\nApplications of Filtering \nEstimation of ARMA Models\nRegime-Switching Markov Models\nReplication of Hedge Funds\nAppendix A: Probability Distributions\nAppendix B: Estimation of Parameters\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1dbbc4515cff3438b25733e5a9194ec85177d5e","amp;dn":"Statistical+Methods+for+Financial+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1dbbc4515cff3438b25733e5a9194ec85177d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,219,188,69,21,207,243,67,139,37,115,62,90,145,148,236,133,23,125,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
