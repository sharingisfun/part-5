For each skirmish or engagement, the player has a fixed budget and a maximum number of ships (pilots), as well as various other limitations or rules which influence the outcome of the battle. For example, a given environment may reduce the effectiveness of ship shields, or may reduce weapon ranges. Players must take this information into account when selecting and positioning the ships that form their own fleet. Once players have selected their ships and issued orders to the ships concerning how to engage the enemy fleet, the battle begins. The battle itself proceeds completely without human interaction, with the outcome being determined entirely based on the data, rather than on player reflexes or mid-battle decisions.\n\ncs . rin . ru","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc77d11bdeb234b1aee2e3d8d17afdbc8b7a9551","amp;dn":"Gratuitous+Space+Battles+1.59+%2B+all+DLCs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc77d11bdeb234b1aee2e3d8d17afdbc8b7a9551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,119,209,27,222,178,52,177,174,226,227,216,209,122,253,188,139,122,149,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
