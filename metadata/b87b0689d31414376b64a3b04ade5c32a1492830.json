This will help us during the modeling and baking phase of our project.\n\nFrom there we'll begin modeling the low polygon version of the RC car and discuss many of the key tools and techniques for game modeling. We'll discuss ways to reuse models from the high-polygon version and then use the Graphite Modeling tools to learn how the retopologize workflow works.\n\nOnce we've finished modeling we'll begin unwrapping our low-polygon version and discuss how to properly pack our UVs to get the most out of our textures. To wrap the training course up, we'll learn how to bake maps that will give us the high-poly look we desire on our low-poly model.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to model for video games and you'll have all the skills you need to begin creating your own game models.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b87b0689d31414376b64a3b04ade5c32a1492830","amp;dn":"Digital-Tutors+-+Introduction+to+Modeling+for+Games+in+3ds+Max","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b87b0689d31414376b64a3b04ade5c32a1492830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,123,6,137,211,20,20,55,107,100,163,176,74,222,92,50,161,73,40,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
