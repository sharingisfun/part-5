Date: February 2006\n* Publisher: Cool Springs Press\n* Format: Paperback , 271pp\n\n* ISBN-13: 9781591862024\n* ISBN: 1591862027\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThis guide blends the author's Square Foot method of gardening with a highly illustrated &quot;how-to&quot; approach that every gardener will understand. Includes over 75 photographs, illustrations, instructions, and charts showing growth rate and proper plant choice.\n\nLibrary Journal\n\nBartholomew, author of the popular Square Foot Gardening (1981), has refined his original square-foot gardening concept by adding ten improvements, including a new location for the garden that is closer to the house, a special soil mix, and six-inch deep, 4' x 4' above-ground boxes with grids. His techniques do not require heavy digging or fertilizers and feature advice on using vertical gardening to save space. He clearly explains the square-foot concept, from the rationale behind it (the square-foot garden takes up much less space than traditional row gardening and saves time, money, and aggravation) to how to plan the garden, build the boxes and vertical supports, and employ his planting and cultural techniques. There are also helpful charts for succession planting and spacing plants and a schedule for starting seeds indoors. Despite its somewhat annoying tendency to read like an infomercial, this attractive, easy-to-understand, and well-organized book for both novice and experienced gardeners is recommended for all libraries.-Sue O'Brien, Downers Grove P.L., IL \n\nBiography:\n\nBestselling author, Mel Bartholomew was an engineer by profession and a gardener by weekend. Using his engineering expertise, he developed a system that yields 100% of the harvest in 20% of the space. MelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s method gained popularity and ultimately he converted millions of gardeners world-wide to his Square Foot method. The Square Foot Gardening titles have sold more than 2 million copies.\n\n\n** Please seed, and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd9bf51fcfd196367f9b631c298440a21a95be4","amp;dn":"All+New+Square+Foot+Gardening+-+%5BPDF%5D+%5BZDaddy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd9bf51fcfd196367f9b631c298440a21a95be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,217,191,81,252,253,25,99,103,249,182,49,194,152,68,10,33,169,91,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
