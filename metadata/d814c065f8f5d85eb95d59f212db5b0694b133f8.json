The Bands of Mourning are the mythical metalminds owned by the Lord Ruler, said to grant anyone who wears them the powers that the Lord Ruler had at his command. Hardly anyone thinks they really exist. A kandra researcher has returned to Elendel with images that seem to depict the Bands, as well as writings in a language that no one can read.

Along the way he discovers hints that point to the true goals of his uncle Edwarn and the shadowy organization known as The Set","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d814c065f8f5d85eb95d59f212db5b0694b133f8","amp;dn":"The+Bands+of+Mourning+Mistborn+Novel+%282016%29+%28epub%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d814c065f8f5d85eb95d59f212db5b0694b133f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,20,192,101,248,245,216,94,185,93,89,242,18,219,91,6,148,177,51,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
