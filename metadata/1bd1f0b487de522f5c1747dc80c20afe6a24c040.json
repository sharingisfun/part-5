Avallone, Theodore Baumeister, Ali Sadegh\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Professional | ISBN: 0071428674 | 2006 | PDF | 1800 pages\n\n\nProduct Description:\n\nSolve any mechanical engineering problem quickly and easily with the world's leading engineering handbook\n\nNearly 1800 pages of mechanical engineering facts, figures, standards, and practices, 2000 illustrations, and 900 tables clarifying important mathematical and engineering principle, and the collective wisdom of 160 experts help you answer any analytical, design, and application question you will ever have.\n\n\n\nSummary: Excellent Engineering Book\nRating: 5\n\nThe book version I purchased has a blue cover, not the green one pictured. But the appearence does not matter. This is an excellent engineering text that covers nearly all aspects of engineering (materials, electrical and even automotive). I highly recommend this text for those looking for a single engineering reference point.\n\n\nSummary: The Timeless Engineering Handbook\nRating: 5\n\nThis is a timeless Mechanical Engineering Handbook. I used it in college, and I use it when needed. The handbook is very general and does provide a lot of useful information. The key to this handbook is knowing where to look for information. Descriptions and explanations are kept brief and to the point. I like this. The explanations are just enough to help you understand the basics subject matter and point you in the right direction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd1f0b487de522f5c1747dc80c20afe6a24c040","amp;dn":"Marks%5C%27+Standard+Handbook+for+Mechanical+Engineers+%2811th+Editi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd1f0b487de522f5c1747dc80c20afe6a24c040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,209,240,180,135,222,82,47,92,23,71,220,128,194,10,254,106,36,192,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
