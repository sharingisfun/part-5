Look, not many people are into this type of music so be kind and seed this torrent - not just because you love ONLY this band but because youre a decent metal fan in general!  \n\nIf you cant do this one simple thing in support of REAL music then I suggest you follow the rest of the sheep by finding a torrent for &quot;Hollywood Undead&quot; or &quot;Kanye West&quot; and sucking a fat dick.\n\n\nSupport your local head banger and kill an emo or scene kid whenever possible.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnyway, on to the jist of it:\n\n\nEyehategod is an American sludge metal band from New Orleans who formed in 1988 and have become one of the most important bands to emerge from the NOLA metal scene. \n\nThroughout the years their core line-up has remained the same with the exception of the bass guitarist - a slot which has seen several come and go.\n\nEyehategod have noted The Melvins,The Obsessed, Black Flag, and Black Sabbath as key influences to their sound. Heavy, detuned, and bluesy guitar riffs combined with walls of feedback and tortured vocals create a harsh misanthropic vibe.  \n\nLook.....its Jimmy bower, Mike Williams AND this band is from the South; NUFF FUCKIN' SAID.\n\nEnjoy and for Christ's sake SEED!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAll MP3's are 256 kbps.  \n\n\n\n\nSouthern Discomfort \n\n1.
