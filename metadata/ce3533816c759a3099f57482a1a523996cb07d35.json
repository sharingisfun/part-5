Books in the series address the practical needs of both users and system developers. Initial titles comprise handy references for MjX users; forthcoming works will expand that core. Ultimately, the series will cover other typesetting and information processing systems, as well, especially insofar as those systems offer unique value to the scientific and technical community. The series goal is to enhance your ability to produce, maintain, manipulate, or reuse articles, papers, reports, proposals, books, and other documents with professional quality.\n\n\nSeries Editor \nFrank Mittelbach \nManager LaTeX3 Project, Germany \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOCR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce3533816c759a3099f57482a1a523996cb07d35","amp;dn":"The+LaTeX+companion.+Tools+and+techniques+for+computer+typesetti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce3533816c759a3099f57482a1a523996cb07d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,53,51,129,108,117,154,48,153,245,116,130,161,165,35,153,108,176,125,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
