Application areas include paternity testing, forensic casework, family lineage studies, identification of human remains, and DNA databasing. Forensic DNA Analysis: Current Practices and Emerging Technologies explores the fundamental principles and the application of technologies for each aspect of forensic DNA analysis.\n\nThe book begins by discussing the value of DNA evidence and how to properly recognize, document, collect, and store it. The remaining chapters examine:\n\nThe most widely adopted methods and the best practices for DNA isolation from forensic biological samples and human remains\nStudies carried out on the use of both messenger RNA and small (micro) RNA profiling\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for quantification and assessment of human DNA prior to genotyping\nCapillary electrophoresis (CE) as a tool for forensic DNA analysis\nNext-generation short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping kits for forensic applications, the biological nature of STR loci, and Y-chromosome STRs (Y-STRs)\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence analysis\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels) in typing highly degraded DNA\nDeep-sequencing technologies\nThe current state of integrated systems in forensic DNA analysis\nThe book concludes by discussing various aspects of sample-processing training and the entities that provide such training programs. This volume is an essential resource for students, researchers, teaching faculties, and other professionals interested in human identification/forensic DNA analysis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:612186b61863f31eaf272f849a0ccf6089af4bd9","amp;dn":"Forensic+DNA+Analysis-+Shewale+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"612186b61863f31eaf272f849a0ccf6089af4bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,33,134,182,24,99,243,30,175,39,47,132,154,12,207,96,137,175,75,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
