In Detect Deceit, David Craig, an international expert in undercover operations, provides readers with an easy-to-follow guide on applying lie detection skills to your everyday life. From bargaining, making a purchase, or dealing with children, to the more serious issues of negotiating a contract or identifying infidelity, Craig delivers simple but effective tips and techniques we can all use to see behind the faÃƒÂ§ade and get to the truth. \nSplit into three parts, the book looks at the nature of lying and how to detect lies, and includes an easy reference section that summarizes all the main points. Lying is a normal part of human communication and sometimes is necessary to protect someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feelings, but there are also hurtful lies meant to deceive. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always rely on what comes out of someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mouth. With fullcolor photographs and practical examples, Detect Deceit provides anyone with the tools to be a human lie detector. The mystery of what a person is really thinking is finally unlocked in this fascinating and informative book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6ff3d8a05af367bfbc41faff0b797ec69125e0c","amp;dn":"Detect+Deceit-+David+Craig+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6ff3d8a05af367bfbc41faff0b797ec69125e0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,255,61,138,5,175,54,123,251,196,31,175,240,183,151,236,105,18,94,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
