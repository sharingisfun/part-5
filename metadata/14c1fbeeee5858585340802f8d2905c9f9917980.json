I've collected couple of rare footage from youtube (before it disappears) and added other torrents to make one torrent collecting everything thats out there in video format. A.W. has a great influence on me, thus if you have any other video, kindly let me know, I'd like to see and also update the torrent.\n\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nContent:\n- Time &amp; The More It Changes          -&gt; 0:50:32 -&gt; 172MB\n- Work as Play.mp4                    -&gt; 0:22:58 -&gt; 59,4MB\n- Buddhism &amp; Science (1960)           -&gt; 0:28:30 -&gt; 75,9MB\n- Death (1959)                        -&gt; 0:27:08 -&gt; 79,3MB\n- Mahayana Buddhism (1960)            -&gt; 0:29:02 -&gt; 78,5MB\n- Conversation with Myself            -&gt; 0:28:06 -&gt; 73MB\n- The Discipline of Zen (1960)        -&gt; 0:27:28 -&gt; 71,9MB\n- The Void (1959)                     -&gt; 0:28:15 -&gt; 76,3MB\n- The Best of Alan Watts              -&gt; 1:01:18 -&gt; 168MB\n- Alan Watts by South Park creators   -&gt; 0:12:03 -&gt; 103MB\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFile formats - mp4, avi\nTotal size   - 5hours\nTopics       - Spirituality, Reality, Consciousness, Religion, Eastern Mysticism,\n               Philosophy\nSources      - Youtube, Thepiratebay\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWho's Alan Watts?\n\n&quot;Alan Wilson Watts was a British-born philosopher, writer, and speaker, best known as an interpreter and populariser of Eastern philosophy for a Western audience.&quot;\n- Wikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c1fbeeee5858585340802f8d2905c9f9917980","amp;dn":"Alan+Watts+on+video+%28collection%29+%5B1959+-%26gt%3B+1973%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c1fbeeee5858585340802f8d2905c9f9917980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,193,251,238,238,88,88,88,83,64,128,47,141,41,5,201,249,145,121,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
