These conflicts started early immediately after the Apostolic Age. It deepened in the following years and finally resulted in the breakup of Christendom into a multitude of sects and denominations.\n\nThe first major schism in Christianity happened in 325 in the First Council of Nicaea. This schism resulted in the breakup of Arianism from the official Christianity endorsed by the Roman Emperor Constantine.\n\nThe First Council of Ephesus in 431 resulted in another schism and the breakup of the Assyrian Church of the East.\n\nThen came the First Council of Chalcedon in 451 which resulted in a major schism and the breakup of Oriental Orthodoxy from Roman Catholicism.\n\nThese schisms were followed by more schisms in the following centuries that resulted in further breakups in Christendom.\n\n\nThere are 15 titles in this UL:\n\n1- Schisms and Their Councils (Diagram)\n\n2- Wikipedia - Ecumenical Council\n\n3- Bolmer - The Church and the Faith: A Philosophical History of the Catholic Church (1887)\n\n4- Boyle - A Historical View of the Council of Nice (1836)\n\n5- Dudley - History of the First Council of Nice (1880)\n\n6- Kaye - Some Account of Council of Nicaea (1853)\n\n7- Newman - The Arians of the Forth Century (1871)\n\n8- Wessel - Cyril of Alexandria and the Nestorian Controversy (2004)\n\n9- Vinde - The Nestorian Churches (1937)\n\n10- Meinardus - Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity (1990)\n\n11- Pearson &amp; Goehring - The Roots of Egyptian Christianity (1986)\n\n12- Wigram - An Introduction to History of the Assyrian Church (1910)\n\n13- Bernard - History of Christian Doctrine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vol. 1 (1995)\n\n14- Bernard - History of Christian Doctrine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vol. 2 (1995)\n\n15- Bernard - History of Christian Doctrine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vol. 3 (1995)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec76c2f8f6a997e761ce133b2c7c98f3b3f74ff7","amp;dn":"Schisms+in+Christianity+-+Schisms+in+the+4th+and+5th+Centuries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec76c2f8f6a997e761ce133b2c7c98f3b3f74ff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,118,194,248,246,169,151,231,97,206,19,59,44,124,152,243,179,247,79,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
