The best way to meet this challenge is to automate mundane or repetitive tasks wherever possible. In this book, three Cisco experts show you how to use Tcl scripting for Cisco IOS devices to do just that.\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn easy techniques for creating, using, and modifying Tcl scripts that run directly on Cisco network devices from the Cisco IOS command line. The authors first teach basic Tcl commands and concepts for capturing and manipulating data and for querying or controlling Cisco equipment. Building on these core skills, they show you how to write scripts that automate and streamline many common IOS configuration, monitoring, and problem-solving tasks.\n\nTitle: TcL Scripting for Cisco IOS\nAuthor(s): Raymond Blair, Arvind Durai, John Lautmann\nPublisher: Cisco Press\nScripting: 2010\nISBN: 978-1587059452\nFormat: EPUB - MOBI - PDF\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
