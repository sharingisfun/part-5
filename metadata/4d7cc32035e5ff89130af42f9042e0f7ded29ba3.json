The combat lifesaver may\nalso assist the combat medic in providing care and preparing casualties for evacuation\nwhen the combat lifesaver has no combat duties to perform.\nNormally, one member of each squad, team, crew, or equivalent-sized unit will be\ntrained as a combat lifesaver.\nA major advantage of the combat lifesaver is that he will probably be nearby if a\nmember of his squad or crew is injured. It may take a combat medic several minutes or\nlonger to reach the casualty, especially if there are several other casualties and/or the\nmedic is at another location. The combat lifesaver is trained to provide immediate care\nthat can save a casualty's life, such as stopping severe bleeding, administering\nintravenous fluids to control shock, and performing needle chest decompression for a\ncasualty with tension pneumothorax.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d7cc32035e5ff89130af42f9042e0f7ded29ba3","amp;dn":"Combat+Lifesaver+Course-Student+Self+Study+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d7cc32035e5ff89130af42f9042e0f7ded29ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,124,195,32,53,229,255,137,19,10,244,47,144,66,224,247,222,210,155,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
