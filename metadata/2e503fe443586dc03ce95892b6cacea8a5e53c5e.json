Some consider this detrimental to the sound quality when reproduced on high-quality equipment. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab releases are highly desirable due to their attention to detail concerning the audio mastering process. Some of the techniques used are half-speed mastering and pressing gold-plated CDs. MFSL also releases record albums meant to be played at 45 RPM instead of the standard 33? RPM, for better sound quality. These albums must be released on two or three discs, as less music can be held at increased speed.\n\nMFSL only acquires the license to reproduce releases for a specific time period, and because of the limited quantities produced, they are highly sought after.\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab Philosophy\n\n\n\nMobile Fidelity Sound Lab&amp;#039;s ongoing quest is to deliver the foremost sounding audio entertainment software that technological innovation can provide. From our first UHQRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ vinyl LP to our latest Ultradisc UHRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ SACD, we have been and will remain a steadfast innovator in the audiophile frontier. We further believe that technological development serves best when accompanied by a profound awareness and appreciation for the elusive magic and mystery that comprises music itself. Our greatest hope is that our products will serve as conduits for ears ands souls to experience premium, pure, natural sound reproduction of diverse, pre-eminent original master recordings across the entire musical spectrum\n\nThe album\n\n\n.......and &quot;Nevermind&quot; still sounds fresh. How? Nirvana were just that damn good. Dave Grohl&amp;#039;s drumming was not only powerful, but lightning-speed fast (my personal pick for the greatest drummer ever). Krist Novoselic&amp;#039;s bass skills were amazing, melodic, furious, and catchy. And Kurt Cobain, well, what can&amp;#039;t you say about the guy? I can sit here and say all these great (and true) things about Kurt, but I&amp;#039;ll leave it at this: there is a reason Kurt is a legend, and this was proven numerous times before his unfortunate passing. All the classics are here, &quot;In Bloom&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Come As You Are&quot; (my personal favorite from the band), and, of course, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. But the album as a whole is amazing. &quot;Drain You&quot; is one of the best Alternative songs ever made. &quot;Breed&quot;, &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;, and &quot;Stay Away&quot; are punk rock perfection. &quot;Something In The Way&quot; is haunting (it&amp;#039;s far superior on their &quot;Unplugged In New York&quot; album), while &quot;Polly&quot; is a glimpse of Cobain&amp;#039;s &quot;softer&quot; side at it&amp;#039;s best. Even the worst ones here, &quot;Lounge Act&quot; and &quot;On A Plane&quot;, are better than anything Creed will ever do (I guess that isn&amp;#039;t saying much, but you get the point, those two songs are still brilliant). Cobain was a brilliant singer-songwriter, he could be filled with rage and self-doubt one second (&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Something In The Way&quot;) and be funny the next (&quot;Breed&quot; and &quot;Lithium&quot;). From lines like &quot;Here we are now, entertain us&quot; to &quot;I&amp;#039;m so ugly, that&amp;#039;s okay, &amp;#039;cause so are you&quot;, not many could even come close to the talent of Kurt Cobain. From start to finish, Nirvana made one of those rare albums that manages to pull everything out of the bare essentials (guitars, bass, drums) and make an absolute classic out of it. Some of these songs sound better on the band&amp;#039;s live albums, and even &quot;In Utero&quot; was just as good as &quot;Nevermind&quot; (despite what some say), and even those two albums put together could not equal &quot;Unplugged In New York&quot;; but this still stands as a landmark for not only rock, but music in general. It was talent beyond anything mortal, that&amp;#039;s for sure. --\n\nCuriousity:\n\nAfter the song &quot;Something in the way&quot; wait, after about 10 minutes, there is another song, you cant skip directly to it, but you can save time by &quot;fast forwarding&quot; , listen to it ... and have fun!\n\nSo far you are all *wrong* in your description of this hidden track. In a rare promo only interview CD titled &quot;Nevermind, It&amp;#039;s an interview&quot; which was released to select radio stations around the US circa 1992, the boys explained the song which begins 13:51 after the start of track 12...\n\n(Dave Grohl) &quot;When we got our first CD and popped it in, we listened to it...oh let&amp;#039;s check to see if that track is there, and it wasn&amp;#039;t there. The reason for it, I think the original reason was because &amp;#039;Something in the Way&amp;#039; is sort of like your slower, whatever song. It&amp;#039;s the last song on the record and most likely to be listened to by like someone that would have like a carousel CD player and so, ok, why not just screw up their little carousel deal?&quot;\n\nHe goes on to further describe it as a &amp;#039;total noise song&amp;#039;. It was never named by the band; it was supposed to be a joke!\n\nThis is from a book titled, Nirvana: The Chosen Rejects. Nevermind 1991: First 50,000 CD copies did not include the unlisted bonus track &quot;Endless Nameless.&quot; On this CD the water is painted all the way to the center of the CD; on the second version the color stops and the center is clear. And on page 98 it says: Creating a gold mine for collectors, the first pressings of Nevermind did not include &quot;Endless Nameless.&quot; The oversight by DGC was corrected shortly thereafter when a new pressing was immediately sent out once the error was discovered. So the cd&amp;#039;s that do not include &quot;Endless Nameless&quot; according to this book, are RARE, and those that do include it are not rare. :\n\n\nThe songs list:\n\n1. Smells Like Teen Spirit\n2. In Bloom\n3. Come As You Are\n4. Breed\n5. Lithium\n6. Polly\n7. Territorial Pissings\n8. Drain You\n9. Lounge Act\n10. Stay Away\n11. On A Plain\n12. Something In The Way/Endless, Nameless\n\n\nIf Nevermind&amp;#039;s sound is familiar now, it&amp;#039;s only because thousands of rock records that followed it were trying very hard to cop its style. It tears out of the speakers like a cannonball, from the punk-turbo-charged riff of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; onward, magnifying and distilling the wounded rage of 15 years of the rock underground into a single impassioned roar. Few albums have occupied the cultural consciousness like this one; of its 12 songs, roughly 10 are now standards. The record&amp;#039;s historical weight can make it hard to hear now with fresh ears, but the monumental urgency of Kurt Cobain&amp;#039;s screams is still shocking. --Douglas Wolk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e503fe443586dc03ce95892b6cacea8a5e53c5e","amp;dn":"Nirvana+-+Nevermind+MFSL+WAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e503fe443586dc03ce95892b6cacea8a5e53c5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,80,63,228,67,88,109,192,60,233,88,146,182,202,206,168,165,229,60,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
