The game is set in the fictional American city of Lost Heaven (loosely based on New York City and Chicago of the same time period).\nAlthough the plot is not directly taken from the movie, certain names such as Paulie, and certainly the faces of the characters, the style and pace of the story, and many scene elements appear to be heavily inspired by the 1990 Martin Scorcese film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. Indeed, the front of the box playfully announces &quot;Welcome to the game of the greatest 1930s gangster film Scorcese never made.&quot;\n\nThe player takes the role of taxi driver Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Angelo, who, while trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven, unexpectedly and unwillingly becomes involved in organized crime as a driver for the Salieri crime family, led by Don Ennio Salieri.\n\nThrough the events of the game's story, Tommy begins to rise through the ranks of the Salieri 'family', which is currently battling the competing Morello family, led by the sharply-dressed Don Morello. Eventually becoming disillusioned by his life of crime and violence, Tommy arranges to meet a detective (Detective Norman) in order to tell him his story, to be given witness-protection, and to aid the detective in the destruction of the Salieri crime family. The 'Intermezzo' chapters of the game depict Tommy sitting in a cafe with the detective, relating his life story and giving out important pieces of information at the same time.\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n-The ISO file Is Password Protected\n-The password is the same as the file name, excluding the .iso extension\n-Copy and paste the name of the game in the little dialog box\n-Either mount using an image processor program onto a virtual drive or extract to    any desired location that you prefer.\n-Open the game folder and search for the executive button to play instantly!!!!\n-Injoy quality rips only from [The-B1ight3r]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02778598c00c23e857b2bc46cfffd161f49f4cf0","amp;dn":"Mafia%3A+The+City+Of+Lost+Heaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02778598c00c23e857b2bc46cfffd161f49f4cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,119,133,152,192,12,35,232,87,178,188,70,207,255,209,97,244,159,76,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
