This was a visionary album, a record that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus -- it was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk. Its roots hearken back to the Jacksons' huge mid-'70s hit &quot;Dancing Machine,&quot; but this is an enormously fresh record, one that remains vibrant and giddily exciting years after its release. This is certainly due to Jackson's emergence as a blindingly gifted vocalist, equally skilled with overwrought ballads as &quot;She's Out of My Life&quot; as driving dancefloor shakers as &quot;Working Day and Night&quot; and &quot;Get on the Floor,&quot; where his asides are as gripping as his delivery on the verses. It's also due to the brilliant songwriting, an intoxicating blend of strong melodies, rhythmic hooks, and indelible construction. Most of all, its success is due to the sound constructed by Jackson and producer Quincy Jones, a dazzling array of disco beats, funk guitars, clean mainstream pop, and unashamed (and therefore affecting) schmaltz that is utterly thrilling in its utter joy. This is highly professional, highly crafted music, and its details are evident, but the overall effect is nothing but pure pleasure. Jackson and Jones expanded this approach on the blockbuster Thriller, often with equally stunning results, but they never bettered it. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jpR8s9LsL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jpR8s9LsL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nDon't Stop 'til You Get Enough Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:05 (Michael Jackson)\nRock With You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:40 (Rod Temperton)\nWorkin' Day and Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:14 (Michael Jackson)\nGet On The Floor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:39 (Michael Jackson, Louis Johnson)\nOff the Wall Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:05 (Rod Temperton)\nGirlfriend Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:05 (Paul McCartney)\nShe's Out of My Life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37 (Tom Bahler)\nI Can't Help It Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:29 (Stevie Wonder, Susaye Greene)\nIt's The Falling In Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:48 (Carole Bayer Sager, David Foster) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Duetto con Patti Austin\nBurn This Disco Out Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41 (Rod Temperton)\n\nTracce extra, aggiunte nella Special Edition del 2001\n\nIntervista #1 con Quincy Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:37\nintroduzione per Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough (Original Demo From 1978) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:13\nDon't Stop 'Til You Get Enough (Original Demo From 1978) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:48 (Michael Jackson)\nIntervista #2 con Quincy Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:30\nintroduzione per Workin' Day And Night (original Demo From 1978) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:10\nWorkin' Day and Night (Original Demo From 1978) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20 (Michael Jackson)\nIntervista #3 con Quincy Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:49\nIntervista #1 con Rod Temperton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:57\nIntervista #4 con Quincy Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:231e1a54e254d10ea4a86266ebf1dc3c198317b1","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Off+The+Wall+%28sp.ed.reissue%29+MP3+320+TNT+Villa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"231e1a54e254d10ea4a86266ebf1dc3c198317b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,30,26,84,226,84,209,14,164,168,98,102,235,241,220,60,25,131,23,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
