You hear a gurgling sound. Is it the undead? NoÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your stomach.\n\nWhen the zombie apocalypse tears down life and society as we know it, it will mean no more take out, no more brightly lit, immaculately organized aisles of food just waiting to be plucked effortlessly off the shelves. No more trips down to the local farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ market. No more microwaved meals in front of the TV or intimate dinner parties. No, when the undead rise, eating will be hard, and doing it successfully will become an art.\n\nThe Art of Eating through the Zombie Apocalypse is a cookbook and culinary field guide for the busy zpoc survivor. With more than 80 recipes (from Overnight of the Living Dead French Toast and ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not Easy Growing Greens Salad to Down &amp; Out Sauerkraut, Honey &amp; Blackberry Mead, and Twinkie Trifle), scads of gastronomic survival tips, and dozens of diagrams and illustrations that help you scavenge, forage, and improvise your way to an artful post-apocalypse meal. The Art of Eating is the ideal handbook for efficient food sourcing and inventive meal preparation in the event of an undead uprising.\n\nWhether you decide to hole up in your own home or bug out into the wilderness, whether you prefer to scavenge the dregs of society or try your hand at apocalyptic agriculture, and regardless of your level of skill or preparation, The Art of Eating will help you navigate the wasteland and make the most of what you eat.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLauren was infected with a rare strain of undead enthusiasm over a decade ago while fighting off the zombie menace of Raccoon City in the original Resident Evil. From video games to comic books, zombie walks to online communities, there are few corners of the culture she has not explored. And sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a decent zed t-shirt collection, to boot.\n\nWhen not nerding out about zombies, space, or Adventure Time, Lauren works in the world of food as a professional cook and writer. Since completing her culinary training at Toronto's George Brown Chef School in 2008 she has done a variety of workÃ¢â‚¬â€from restaurant cooking to cheesemongering, online sales to catering, teaching cooking classes to writing for print and online media. She completed research and course development work at George Brown examining the career motivations, ambitions, and expectations of students with the aim of better understanding low female representation at the executive level of professional kitchens.\n\nAfter eating up all the good bits of Toronto, Lauren followed a trail of crumbs to Brooklyn, where she is cooking, eating, writing, and teaching happily","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125d66a76d17bab20b6a74de3bd7bab5eb25c917","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Eating+through+the+Zombie+Apocalypse+%282014%29Pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125d66a76d17bab20b6a74de3bd7bab5eb25c917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,93,102,167,109,23,186,178,11,106,116,222,59,215,186,181,235,37,201,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
