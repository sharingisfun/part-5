It features hundreds of eyewitness accounts from frontline soldiers, generals, statesmen, children and women from all sides in the conflict. The First World War shaped the twentieth century. It sparked the Russian Revolution and launched America as a world power. The fault-line from its failed peace settlement led to a second terrible world war barely twenty years later. We live with its unresolved consequences; in the Middle East, the Balkans and Ireland.\nOriginally shown on Channel 4 in 2003.\n\n9)  Germanys Last Gamble \nIn March 1918, Germany launched a massive offensive on the Western Front - her bid to win the war before the Americans arrived. The master was General Erich Ludendorff - a genius, but unstable. Within days the British Fifth Army was in retreat, Paris was under shell-fire and some Allies feared defeat. But Germany's allies, Ottoman Turkey and Austria-Hungary, were starving and demoralised and the war-weary German Home Front was infected with dangerous socialist ideas. Then Ludendorff's great offensive ran out of steam, having stormed ahead without strategic aims or supplies. German soldiers slowed, exhausted and hungry. And then the Americans started pouring in.\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;460e2f212e060a726877&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3860Kbps)\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.41 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 50 mins\n * Number Of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 1.39 GB (average)\n * Source: HDTV (upscaled)\n * Encoded by: JungleBoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f719b54b5d62085e9a84fb5b709741c90e4a9019","amp;dn":"BBC+The+First+World+War+09of10+Germanys+Last+Gamble+720p+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f719b54b5d62085e9a84fb5b709741c90e4a9019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,25,181,75,93,98,8,94,154,132,251,91,112,151,65,201,14,74,144,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
