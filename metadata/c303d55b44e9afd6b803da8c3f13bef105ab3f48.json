Its 12 tracks are developed from the soundtrack the band wrote for Senegalese director Djibril Diop MambÃƒÂ©tyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1973 road movie Touki Bouki. The record sleeve is taken from the film as well: it shows the hero riding his motorcycle with bull-horns mounted on the handlebars. The filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title is Wolof for Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Journey of the Hyena,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ hence the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title, and in the song Walking Man the wild dog is referenced in some of the lyrics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walking tall [Ã¢â‚¬Â¦] with bootless feetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fingers scratch on broken glassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ present the travails of a human journey.\nThe occasional vocals of Ali Friend punctuate a primarily instrumental record, but his bass drives and leads it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the defining sound that opens the album: first track Card Trick is dominated by a bassline that lopes along, unsure whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speeding or stoned. Herder Can Ride is all about the interplay between bass and David AyersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ guitar; while in Lassoo the opening guitar figure that might herald a soft ballad gives way to a booming bassline.\nGiven the origins of Hyena, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unsurprising that Red Snapper have looked to African music as inspiration. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s there most noticeably in the percussion and the rhythms. Wonky Bikes is the most percussive track here, with clanking woodblocks and a jittering drumbeat, and interjections of whistle-like electronics. You might well see 1970s Dakar in this album: the African influences are present to about the same degree as in Damon AlbarnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent music, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty more to get wrapped up in.\nThe other main influence seems to be the kind of soulful electronica thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purveyed by the likes of James Blake and Kwes. Walking Man is a minimal production that calls to mind South London dubstep more than it does the landscape of Africa. The guitar-led songs sometimes call to mind latter-day Radiohead, particularly Mambety, where Friend sings about a Ã¢â‚¬ËœfoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paradiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ over hollow beats and ponderous guitar.\nDespite the musical strands that weave through Hyena, Red Snapper occasionally throw a curveball. Village Tap is perhaps the most distinct song here. Its disco sound initially sounds like it might be a trick, about to morph into something completely different, but when the guitar licks really start to roll along, you know theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be driving the track all the way. Still, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel out of place. The weaker songs, the ones that most disrupt the flow, are Dock Running and Traffic, where saxophone overpowers everything else, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sense that the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essence has been accidentally swallowed by jazz.\nAs the album comes to an end its full scope becomes clear and its many textures draw together. Penultimate track Archout is propelled partly by insistent bass and kick-drum in another African rhythm, but at the times the percussion becomes much more subtle, meshing with skittering synth effects as a mellow guitar line floats across the top of it. Finally, No Exit starts out sounding like a song by The xx, with the guitar given breathing space around droned strings and synths, and the track develops into something pleasingly stately. The saxophone is more interesting than in its earlier jazz forays, its fanfare breaking out midway through. Then the song rises into a groove as the sax keens its way towards the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s close. The journeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end has been reached.\nReview by Alan Ashton-Smith\nRate 3.5/5\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01. Card Trick (4:39)\n02. Walking Man (3:35)\n03. Village Tap (5:30)\n04.
