He recorded and toured with the likes of Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Horrors before launching his own project in 2009 for which heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s responsible for vocals, sitar, and bass. His band name is a reference to both the song by the Stone Roses and a literal stone that Dhir owns: a statue of the Hindu god of new beginnings, Ganesh. He describes his bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound as Ã¢â‚¬â€œ wait for it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hindie rockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nOn their Polaris long-listed debut, 2009Ã¢â‚¬Â²s The Seven Seas, Dhir set out to incorporate the sitar into shoegaze and indie pop in a seamless way that would devalue neither his instrument nor songs. It worked, at least when he committed to it, but there were moments where it would noticeably shield itself with either heavy sitar droning and noodling or with songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bombs Bomb AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that obviously had no place for it at all. While never boring, The Seven Seas also wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily convincing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hindie rockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was, or should be, an actual thing. Elephant Stone responds to this directly.\n\nWhether by design or not, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appropriate that DhirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album is the self-titled one; at the very least, it provides a much clearer answer to the essential question of what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s out to accomplish with Elephant Stone than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s predecessor did. DhirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sitar is even more of a constant, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s used primarily to richen his psych rock arrangementsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tones than to simply replace guitar leads. Opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Setting SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recalls Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Fear the ReaperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with breezed-out underlying reverb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and hey look, lyrics about new beginnings too (Ã¢â‚¬Å“A setting sun is not an endingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“rebirth to give new lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nWith the exception of the penultimate track Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Sea of Your MindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a nine-minute sitar-and-percussion attack and incidentally one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most impressive, the 10 tracks of Elephant Stone are concise, pop song-length statements that more clearly reflect DhirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learning how to bring to life.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b8056df8dbae41b655d9e5accd3b55a2208797d","amp;dn":"Elephant+Stone+-+Elephant+Stone+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b8056df8dbae41b655d9e5accd3b55a2208797d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,128,86,223,141,186,228,27,101,93,158,90,204,211,181,90,34,8,121,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
