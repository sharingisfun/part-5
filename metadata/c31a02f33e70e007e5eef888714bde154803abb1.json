Dennis Price plays a scandal-sheet publisher named Nigel Dennis who lives high on the hog by blackmailing his wealthy targets. Several of Dennis' victims, including peer Lord Mayley (Terry-Thomas) and model Melissa Right (Shirley Eaton), plot to kill the extortion-grabbing publisher, to no avail. During a wild ride in a malfunctioning blimp, Dennis manages to accomplish by accident what his enemies have tried to do to him on purpose. Though second-billed, the real star of The Naked Truth is Peter Sellers as a smarmy &quot;sincere&quot; TV personality.\n\nEnjoy and please seed thanks people\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c31a02f33e70e007e5eef888714bde154803abb1","amp;dn":"The+Naked+Truth+%281957+Terry+Thomas%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c31a02f33e70e007e5eef888714bde154803abb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,26,2,243,62,112,224,7,229,238,248,136,113,75,222,21,72,3,171,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
