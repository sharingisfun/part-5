A poor Brazilian family struggle to earn a living when they take a job overseeing the livestock of a wealthy rancher. They move into an abandoned house, and their fortunes begin to take an upward turn. The father is duped into a card game with a crooked local policeman. The ranch hand protests, and a fight ensues that results in his beating by the cop. Despite being the victim of injustice, the man believes there should be some semblance of law and order and makes no protest about the incident. A severe drought has the man moving on from the ranch with his family to earn their living elsewhere.\n\nFile Name .........................................: [1963] Vidas Secas - Nelson Pereira dos Santos.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,347,418,112 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:40:00\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: DivX 5.x/6.x\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 29.970\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1704 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.185 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 79 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nABOUT EXTRA:\n\nThe 20-minute Baleia the Dog (it's actually called How One Dies in the Movies, but let's not get lost in translation) is an oddly disarming short on the film's scene-stealing canine star, who gets what must be the most grueling on-screen animal death this side of Old Yeller. Humorously recalled by the bird who got roasted in the beginning, the film offers anecdotes on Baleia's fame at Cannes, how his fictional demise pissed off critics more than the human characters' travails, and, best of all, a reunion between director Santos and star Maria Ribeiro.\n\nFile Name .........................................: [2002] Como Se Morre no Cinema - Luelane Loiola CorrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªa.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 341,422,080 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 19:55.018\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.0 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x464 (AR: 1.517)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2116 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.270 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 160 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
