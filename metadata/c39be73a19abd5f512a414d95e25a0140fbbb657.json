The Spiritual\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Knock the Jukebox\nBy Matt Jones\n\nI love when an albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music matches the cover art.\n\nThis week, Brooklyn-based three piece Jukebox the Ghost has delivered a fine example of such with their third album, Safe Travels. Much like the album art, which takes some brilliant and bold (if conventional) colors and does something beautiful and delightful with them, Jukebox has crafted an album out of straightforward, conventional elements and yet somehow managed to make it sound new and inspiring in the process.\n\nJukebox the Ghost sound especially like a Ben Folds vs. Eric Hutchinson vs. The Head and the Heart mashup at times, and at others, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d swear you were listening to Ben Gibbard singing for Scissor Sisters. The Head and the Heart comparisons are striking mostly because of the plunky piano featured on most songs, although the dynamics are typically more aggressive and give this album a vibe that leans much farther towards pop than folk. And as for the vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ well, Ben ThornewillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is Gibbard-esque enough to begin with, but when he inflects a certain direction or when the harmonies come in, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s positively Death Cab. Every now and then a Foxy Shazam-like guitar riff will pop up and surprise you, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a decent fit with the overall mix and certainly doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t detract from the catchy hooks and upbeat aesthetic.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39be73a19abd5f512a414d95e25a0140fbbb657","amp;dn":"Jukebox+The+Ghost+-+Safe+Travels+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39be73a19abd5f512a414d95e25a0140fbbb657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,155,231,58,25,171,213,245,18,164,20,217,94,37,160,20,15,187,182,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
