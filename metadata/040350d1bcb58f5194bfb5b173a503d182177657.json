CHAPTER 10.\n\nThe story of the movies that tried to change the world in the 70s. The programme starts in Germany with Wim Wenders, then moves to Britain, talking to Ken Loach, before travelling to Italy, and seeing the birth of new Australian cinema, finally arriving in Japan, which was making the most moving films in the world.\n\nEven bigger, bolder questions about film were being asked in Africa and South America, and the story ends with John Lennon's extraordinary and psychedelic favourite film - The Holy Mountain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:040350d1bcb58f5194bfb5b173a503d182177657","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Film+-+An+Odyssey+S01E10.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"040350d1bcb58f5194bfb5b173a503d182177657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,3,80,209,188,181,143,81,148,191,181,177,115,165,3,209,130,23,118,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
