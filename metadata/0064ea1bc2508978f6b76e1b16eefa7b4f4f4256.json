None of us knew it was coming. So says Wes Holloway, a once-cocky and ambitious presidential aide, about the day that changed his life forever. On that Fourth of July, Wes put Ron Boyle, the chief executive's oldest friend, into the presidential limousine. By the time the trip came to an end, Wes was permanently disfigured, and Boyle was dead, the victim of a crazed assassin.\n\nEight years later, Boyle is spotted, alive and well, in Malaysia. In that moment, Wes has the chance to undo the worst day of his life. Trying to figure out what really happened takes Wes back to a decade-old presidential crossword puzzle, mysterious facts buried in Masonic history, and a 200-year-old code invented by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBut what Wes doesn't realize is that The Book of Fate holds everyone's secrets. Especially the ones worth dying for. The Book of Fate. What does it say about you?\n\nWritten by Brad Meltzer\nPerformed Scott Brick\n15 COMPACT DISCS - 16 hours\nHachette Audio; Unabridged edition (September 5, 2006)\n\n--------------------------------------\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n--------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0064ea1bc2508978f6b76e1b16eefa7b4f4f4256","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Fate+-+Brad+Meltzer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0064ea1bc2508978f6b76e1b16eefa7b4f4f4256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,100,234,27,194,80,137,120,246,183,110,27,22,238,250,123,79,79,66,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
