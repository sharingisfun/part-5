Whether examining Lord ActonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dictum that Ã¢â‚¬Å“absolute power corrupts absolutelyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or explicating John Stuart MillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contention that it is Ã¢â‚¬Å“better to be a human dissatisfied than a pig satisfied,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alan Ryan evokes the lives and minds of our greatest thinkers in a way that makes reading about them a transcendent experience. Whether writing about Plato or Augustine, de Toqueville or Thomas Jefferson, Ryan brings a wisdom to his text that illuminates John DeweyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belief that the role of philosophy is less to see truth than to enhance experience. With this unparalleled tour de force, Ryan emerges in his own right as one of the most influential political philosophers of our time.\n\n2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23949cf68fff270940df3de436ab26cc021eb928","amp;dn":"On+Politics%3A+A+History+of+Political+Thought+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23949cf68fff270940df3de436ab26cc021eb928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,148,156,246,143,255,39,9,64,223,61,228,54,171,38,204,2,30,185,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
