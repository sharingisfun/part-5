Rachmaninoff is widely considered one of the finest pianists of his day and, as a composer, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian classical music. Early influences of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers gave way to a thoroughly personal idiom that included a pronounced lyricism, expressive breadth, structural ingenuity, and a tonal palette of rich, distinctive orchestral colors. The piano is featured prominently in Rachmaninoff's compositional output. He made a point of using his own skills as a performer to explore fully the expressive possibilities of the instrument. Even in his earliest works he revealed a sure grasp of idiomatic piano writing and a striking gift for melody. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18, is a concerto for piano and orchestra composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff between the autumn of 1900 and April 1901. The second and third movements were first performed with the composer\nas soloist on 2 December 1900. The complete work was premiered, again with the composer as soloist, on 27 October 1901, with his cousin Alexander Siloti conducting. This piece is one of Rachmaninoff's most enduringly popular pieces and established his fame as a concerto composer. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._2_(Rachmaninoff)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._2_(Rachmaninoff)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, Op. 30, by Sergei Rachmaninoff (colloquially known as &quot;Rach 3&quot;) is famous for its technical and musical demands on the performer. It has the reputation of being one of the most technically challenging concertos in the standard piano repertoire.\nThe concerto is one of the main focuses of the 1996 film Shine, based on the life of pianist David Helfgott. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._3_(Rachmaninoff)#In_film&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._3_(Rachmaninoff)#In_film&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLabel: Naxos Historical\nRelease Date: Jan 1, 2000 \n\nPiano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18\nPerformed by: Philadelphia Orchestra \nComposed by: Sergei Rachmaninov \nConducted by: Leopold Stokowski \nSergei Rachmaninov, piano\nRecording date: 10 and 13 April 1929\nProduced by: Obert-Thorn, Mark\n\n1.I.
