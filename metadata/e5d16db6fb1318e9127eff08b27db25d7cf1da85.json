Promis, All Music Guide All Music Guide - The task of compiling a single-disc best-of collection for legendary Greek chanteuse Nana Mouskouri is virtually impossible, but this 21-track retrospective, spanning the singer's career and incorporating a range of musical styles, is an excellent introduction for the novice or casual fan. For the collector, it offers two rarities: her version of &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot; (in English) and her duet with Michel Legrand, &quot;Quand on S'Aime.&quot; From the song that made her famous (&quot;The White Rose of Athens&quot;) to French opera (Carmen's &quot;Habanera&quot;), the array of musical styles (and languages) this woman has conquered is staggering. This disc, which includes pop songs (&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;), gospel (&quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;), and classics (&quot;Ave Maria&quot;), brings the songs together seamlessly -- it's difficult to imagine that these recordings span nearly 40 years. Despite a serious lack of liner notes, this single-disc compilation is a definite treat, and a wonderful introduction to one of the most famous singers the world has known. \n\nAmazon.com Review By A Customer - This compilation contains 21 of her most beautiful songs, mostly in English, although it also has 3 songs in French (Bizet's &quot;Habanera&quot;, Nana's first- rate version of &quot;Plaisir d'amour&quot; and a very jazzy 1965 duet with French composer Michel Legrand, &quot;Quand on s'aime&quot;),one in Spanish (&quot;En Aranjuez con mi amor&quot;), one in Greek (the predictable &quot;Ta Pedia Tou Pirea&quot;) and Schubert's &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in Latin, of course. The album spans Nana's European and American career from 1962 to 1999 and displays a stupendously broad variety of styles, from romantic hits (&quot;Only Love&quot;, &quot;The White Rose of Athens&quot;, &quot;Try to remember&quot;) to impecable covers of Simon&amp;Garfunkel songs (&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, &quot;Scarborough Fair Canticle&quot;) to cross-over classical choice- morsels (&quot;Song for Liberty&quot; from Verdi's &quot;Nabucco&quot;,&quot;Fields of Love&quot;, adapted from Offenbach's &quot;Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, etc.) to Gospel (&quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;) and, last but not least,...a marvellous version of &quot;Smoke Gets In Your Eyes&quot; recorded by Nana in New York in 1962 under the supervision of Quincy Jones. &quot;Easy listening&quot; is the vaguely condescending label used to describe Nana's songs, but her stupendous eclecticism is anything but spurious or facile, while her classically-trained voice certainly ought to command respect for its unusual depth and flexibility. &quot;At her Very Best&quot; for the past 40 years with 200 million records sold all over the world,... a feat rarely achieved in the world of pop-music!\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Only Love\n[02] The White Rose Of Athens\n[03] Try To Remember\n[04] Over And Over (Roule S'Enroule)\n[05] Fields Of Love\n[06] Bridge Over Troubled Water\n[07] Habanera (De L'OpÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ra &quot;Carmen&quot;)\n[08] Quand On S'Aime\n[09] Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\n[10] En Aranjuez Con Mi Amor (Sur Le ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me Du 2Eme Mov.
