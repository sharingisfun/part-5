And there's nothing wrong with my skills.' Police officer Joe\nLedger, martial arts expert, ex-army, self-confessed brutal warrior\nis scared. The man he's just killed is the same man he killed a week\nago. He never expected to see the man again, definitely not alive, and\ndefinitely not as part of the recruitment process for the hyper-secret\ngovernment agency the Department for Military Sciences. But the DMS\nare scared too - they have word of a terrorist plot straight from a\nnightmare - a bid to spread a plague through America - a plague that\nkills its victims and turns them into zombies. Time is running out and\nJoe has shown he has the abilities they need to lead one of their field\nteams. And so begins a desperate three-part mission - to contain the\nzombie outbreaks, to break the terrorist cell responsible and to find\nthe man in their own team who is selling them out to the terrorists.Patient\nZero is astonishingly fast moving, incredibily violent and down-right\nterrifying thriller - a new breed of thriller of techo-thriller that\nplays on our fears of mad science.\n\nGeneral Information\n===================\nTitle: Patient Zero\nAuthor: Jonathan Maberry\nRead By: Alec Volz\nCopyright: 2009\nAudiobook Copyright: 2009\nGenre: Thriller\nSeries Name: Joe Ledger\nPosition in Series: 1\n\nFile Information\n================\nNumber of MP3s: 14\nTotal Duration: 15:58:23\nTotal MP3 Size: 658.16\nParity Archive: No\nRipped By: quartet1977\nRipped With: audacity\nEncoded With: LAME\nEncoded At: CBR 96 kbit/s 44100 Hz Mono\nID3 Tags: Set, v2.3\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\nVISIT US FOR THIS AND LOADS MORE:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n-------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86fc3048be9d5ce70eb9f4b756e0d11fa8fa5cca","amp;dn":"Patient+Zero+-+Jonathan+Maberry+%5BZombie+Thriller%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86fc3048be9d5ce70eb9f4b756e0d11fa8fa5cca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,252,48,72,190,157,92,231,14,185,244,183,86,224,209,31,168,250,92,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
