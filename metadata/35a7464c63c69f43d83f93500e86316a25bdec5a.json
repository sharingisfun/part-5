Feynman, The Character of Physical Law is the perfect example of Feynman's gift for making complex subjects accessible and entertaining.\nHere Richard Feynman gives his own unique take on the puzzles and problems that lie at the heart of physics, from Newton's Law of Gravitation to mathematics as the supreme language of nature, from the mind-boggling question of whether time can go backwards to the exciting search for new scientific laws.\nUsing simple everyday illustrations to bring out the essence of a complicated principle - for example the surprising parallels between the law of conservation of energy and drying yourself with wet towels - these lectures are a brilliant example of Feynman's mind in action.\n[img]http://images.mobilism.org/?dm=BOGU4WGF[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a7464c63c69f43d83f93500e86316a25bdec5a","amp;dn":"The+Character+of+Physical+Law+by+Richard+P.+Feynman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a7464c63c69f43d83f93500e86316a25bdec5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,167,70,76,99,198,159,67,216,63,147,80,14,134,49,106,37,189,236,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
