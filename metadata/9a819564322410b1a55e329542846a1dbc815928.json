Rex wants to attempt a cure, but White Knight is determined to prevent the infection from spreading,\nand is willing to resort to destroying the city with a nuclear bomb. Complicating the matter further,\nPeter is being blackmailed by Van Kleiss (who has Biowulf kidnap his daughter) and refuses the cure.\nRex and Agent Six must cooperate to save the girl from the Pack and the city from the bomb, all behind White Knight\\'s back.  \n\n3       \\&quot;Beyond the Sea\\&quot;                            Chris Graham          Man of Action        May 7, 2010 (2010-05-07)          693-003\n---    ----------------                           --------------         --------------       -------------------------          --------\n\nIn the hope of finally getting to do something normal, Rex stages another breakout,\ngiving Noah and Bobo a lift to the tourist destination of Cabo Luna for spring break.\nDuring a volleyball game, he meets and falls for a girl called Circe, who initially wants nothing to do with him.\nAnother chance encounter later leads Rex to discover that she is an E.V.O. with ultrasonic sound powers who is trying to earn\nthe right to join the Pack by defeating an E.V.O. sea monster. While Agent Six, Bobo, and Noah attempt to hold Biowulf and Breach at bay,\nRex helps Circe defeat the sea monster E.V.O., and afterward appeals to her to join him at Providence,\nbut she tells him the Pack is the only place she would feel accepted.\nEven though Rex helped Circe defeat the Sea Monster E.V.O., Van Kleiss lets her join anyway.\n\n4       \\&quot;Lockdown\\&quot;                                 Sam Montes            Scott Sonneborn        May 14, 2010 (2010-05-14)        693-004\n---      --------                                  ----------            ---------------        -------------------------        -------\n\nWhile investigating a mysterious bunker at Providence\\'s Petting Zoo known as \\&quot;The Hold,\\&quot; Rex and Noah stumble onto a formidable spider-like E.V.O.\nAfter White Knight locks down the Petting Zoo, Rex and Noah must make it to the exit alive.\nA panicky Noah lets slip that he works for White Knight, which rattles Rex so deeply that he loses the use of his powers.\nThe two manage to make it to the exit, but while Noah apologizes for his deception the friendship seems over.\nHowever, after the spider snatches Noah from the threshold of safety, Rex\\'s feelings of betrayal subside,\nand he proceeds to defeat the E.V.O. and rescue Noah. The E.V.O. is revealed to be Dr. Holiday\\'s incurable sister.\nRex threatens to deal with White Knight if he is spied upon again.

He offers to help the engineers with\nthe huge antenna at the center of the village, but becomes suspicious when he discovers that no one is allowed inside\nthe antenna except the Architect himself. Rex barges into the tower to discover that the Architect is an android,\na creation of the rogue AI ZAG-RS, the computer that is supposed to be the base behind the communicator.\nThe AI explains that the nanites constrain its potential, and that the transmitter\\'s actual purpose is to transmit a self-destruct command\nto all nanites on Earth, which would wipe out all life on the planet.\nRex leads the engineers in a struggle against multiple copies of the Architect to disable the charging antenna,\nsucceeding just in time. Agent Six, who has been looking for Rex, arrives; ZAG-RS uploads itself elsewhere,\nand Jacob and the other engineers decide to stay in their village and continue working for humanity in spite of the Architect\\'s betrayal.\nRex decides to return to Providence, as he believes in its objective despite his dislike of White Knight,\nbut only on the condition that Rex, Bobo, Six, and Holiday have dinner together like a family every Friday night.  \n\n6       \\&quot;Frostbite[2]\\&quot;                           Chris Graham          Marty Isenberg           May 28, 2010 (2010-05-2       693-006\n--       ------------                            -------------         --------------           -------------------------       --------\n\nAbsorbing the nanites from cured Evos takes its toll on Rex, and he is taken to a remote Providence base in the Arctic codenamed \\&quot;Paradise\\&quot;\nto have the excess nanites extracted and stored. The base commander Weaver is upset about the unscheduled visit,\nand his personnel are uncooperative. Dr. Holiday has to threaten them to have Rex treated. Rex is sedated for the procedure;\nafter having an odd dream, he wakes up to find the base personnel unconscious (possibly dead), Six, Holiday, and Bobo missing,\nand the Pack members Biowulf and Skalamander arriving at the base outside. After burying them in an avalanche,\nRex goes back inside to find Weaver, who attempts to render him unconscious.\nRex learns that Weaver has been reactivating the extracted nanites and selling them to Van Kleiss.\nWhen Rex unexpectedly showed up earlier, Weaver had panicked. Rex finds Six, Holiday, and Bobo locked up in a storeroom,\nwhen Biowulf and Skalamander enter the base. Weaver escapes his grasp and demands safe passage,\nbacked with the threat to open the tank containing the extracted nanites. While trying to make it look realistic,\nWeaver accidentally triggers the release and mutates into a gigantic tentacled E.V.O. with regenerative powers.\nBiowulf and Skalamander flee, while Rex and Six fight Weaver. Holiday and Bobo try to launch their air transport\nbefore it falls into a trench in the ice opening under the collapsing base. Rex tries to cure Weaver,\nbut passes out from absorbing too many nanites, though not until after he experiences more jumbled memories and taps into nanite\ncommunications frequencies. Weaver is taken down by Agent Six and the air transport that Dr. Holiday and Bobo are on.\nHe wakes up in \\&quot;Purgatory,\\&quot; a Providence base in a desert, a backup for the Arctic base, with no memory of hearing the nanites.\nAs Bobo and Rex wander out onto the sand, Dr. Holiday tells Six about a odd nanite code\n(it is shown as a binary code on the computer screen) that had appeared after she extracted Rex\\'s nanites.\n\n7      \\&quot;Leader of the Pack[2]\\&quot;                   Sam Montes            Alexx Van Dyne           June 4, 2010 (2010-06-04)        693-007\n---     ---------------------                    ----------            --------------           -------------------------        -------\n\nThe agents of Providence mobilize to stop Van Kleiss when he arrives in New York City aboard a giant flying whale-like E.V.O.,\nbut are forced to stand down when it turns out that he is there to address the UN and therefore has diplomatic immunity.\nRex observes Circe among Van Kleiss\\' followers. Later at Providence, while voicing his suspicions,\nRex learns that he has been invited to a reception at the Abysus consulate, though White Knight intends to dispatch Agent Six and Dr. Holiday instead,\nnot wanting Rex to cause any commotion. Rex locks Six into a room, steals one of his suits,\nand meets Holiday at Van Kleiss\\' party. Six gets out of the room and he and Bobo go to the party.\nRex again spots Circe, but when he tries to get her to tell her what Van Kleiss is doing, she knocks him out.\nAfter the party ends, Rex awakens in a prison cell with Bobo, who had been captured while trying to find him.\nThey escape; Rex goes after Van Kleiss, following Bobo to an underground tunnel,\nwhere Breach and Circe are using large, worm-like E.V.O.s to transport nanite-infused soil from Abysus into the tunnels\n(through one of Breach\\'s portals), enabling the full use of Van Kleiss\\' powers over his surroundings. Breach orders an E.V.O. to attack,\nbut Circe countermands her and tries to convince Rex to join the Pack willingly instead. He declines,\nand a disappointed Circe retreats with Breach into Abysus. Meanwhile, Van Kleiss addresses the UN General Assembly,\nimmediately showing his cards: he takes the envoys hostage inside the chamber and proceeds to demand that the world submit to him.\nRex arrives from the tunnels and tries to fight him, but Van Kleiss\\' powers prove too strong. However,\nan offhand comment Van Kleiss makes leads Rex to return to the tunnels below and bust a large hole in one of the walls,\ncausing the East River to flood the passages and flush out the Abysus soil. An angry Van Kleiss attempts to strangle Rex with vines,\nbut as the Abysus dirt dissolves in the water, his powers fail and he finds himself defenseless. Now holding the advantage,\nRex punches Van Kleiss and manifests a sword, when Van Kleiss tells him that \\&quot;his parents would be proud of him.\\&quot;\nThis causes Rex to hesitate long enough for Van Kleiss to escape on an insect Evo that carries him back to his flying whale,\nwhich retreats through a portal to Abysus. Rex sees Circe inside it; she looks at him with disappointment and turns away.\nAgent Six and Bobo arrive, and Rex is ordered to fix the problem he created and plug the leak in the East River.\n\n8        \\&quot;Breach[2]\\&quot;                          Chris Graham           Adam Beechen              June 11, 2010 (2010-06-11)        693-009\n---       ---------                           -------------          -------------             --------------------------        --------\n\nRex wakes up in a creepy boarding school, full of mannequins and stuffed animals, but no people.\nHe is able to use his ear-link communicator to talk to Dr. Holiday, who informs him that he had been fighting an E.V.O.\nwhen Breach appeared out of nowhere and teleported Rex away. Providence has Breach in custody, but while Six and Bobo are detected in a desert somewhere,\nRex cannot be located. Rex is about to leave the school when he hears a roar; he rescues a small girl from a spider-like E.V.O. which he then cures\nonly to have Breach teleport it away. Rex finds the girl \\&quot;creepy\\&quot; and suspects something is wrong with her, but puts on a brave face for her.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Holiday is unable to get Breach to cooperate; she tries firing probes at Breach,\nwho instinctively opens portals to random spots around the world to protect herself.\nRex wanders through a deserted town; he finds a missing cat poster identifying the town as Greenville, Ohio.\nHe manifest his hoverbike and tries to drive away, but falls off a cliff at the edge of the city, discovering it to be floating in a gray void.\nDr. Holiday informs him that Greenville vanished two years ago, with all its citizens appearing randomly around the world.\nShe realizes that Breach must have taken it and sent it to a pocket dimension to use as her personal dollhouse, with Rex as her latest doll.\nRex kicks over a row of mopeds; Breach gets rid of them through a portal. Rex realizes that this bothers Breach;\nhe begins wrecking things, with Breach dumping them in random places worldwide. The little girl then reveals herself to be a shape-shifting,\nslug-like E.V.O. with a desperate codependent relationship with Breach. She fights Rex, but damages Breach\\'s prize possessions in the process.\nEventually, Breach starts having a nervous breakdown, as her \\&quot;toys\\&quot; had been the only thing keeping her stable.\nDuring her breakdown, she opens a portal to Providence. Even though the slug-girl E.V.O. tries to stop him,\nRex escapes, while Breach - her powers out of control - appears to implode, though it is unspecified weather or not she is dead.\nMeanwhile, Six and Bobo are stuck in the desert fighting a nest of large scorpion-like E.V.O.s,\nthough they are eventually saved when the scorpions are crushed by cars and trucks ejected from Breach\\'s doll house.\nRex, Bobo, Agent Six, and Holiday fly home in a Providence aircraft; Rex observes that Breach\\'s toys were a poor alternative to friends,\nwhich he is lucky to have. Holiday tells Six that people can be more fragile than they seem.\n\n9       \\&quot;Dark Passage\\&quot;                      Sam Montes              Marsha Griffin            June 18, 2010 (2010-06-1         693-010\n---      ------------                       ----------              --------------            --------------------------         -------\n\nAfter packages boobytrapped with a substance that activates nanites are sent to dozens of powerful people around the world,\nbriefly turning them into rampaging E.V.O.s, White Knight dispatches a team made up of Rex, Agent Six, Bobo Haha, and Dr. Holiday to the Amazon\nto secure an abandoned base to which the packages have been traced. The base is where a missing scientist named Gabriel Rylander is thought to be hiding;\nthe team is to apprehend him and secure his research, keeping it from falling to the Pack, which is also en route.\nThe voyage is eventful and dangerous, with the team traveling at first by riverboat and encountering a swarm of piranha-like E.V.O.,\nand later overland, contending with Rylander\\'s automated defenses and sentry robots.\nMeanwhile, the Pack (now including a Jungle Cat E.V.O. member following Breach\\'s presumed death) is led through the forest by Van Kleiss,\nwearing a special soil-circulating suit to maintain his powers. After the Jungle Cat E.V.O. accidentally ruptures the suit during\na skirmish with Rylander\\'s sentry robots, Van Kleiss drains his nanites, petrifying him. The two expeditions locate the base at the same time,\nand a battle ensues. After Providence air support arrives, White Knight orders them to abandon retrieval and simply bomb the building to deny it to Van Kleiss.\nWith the rest of the team fighting the Pack outside, Rex enters the base and finds Rylander, who surprisingly recognizes Rex.\nThe somewhat unstable, rambling Rylander gives Rex a fragmentary account of his past before injecting him with a syringe containing a single large,\nabnormal-looking nanite. Van Kleiss unexpectedly arrives and injures Rylander before he is able to answer any more of Rex\\'s urgent questions.\nVan Kleiss and Rex fight, but when Rex cuts off Van Kleiss\\'s mechanical left hand he uses his powers to gain the upper hand.\nBefore he could finish Rex off, the injured Rylander lunges at Van Kleiss. The two are thrown into the aperture of a reactor vessel,\nwhere both are to all appearances vaporized. Rex is found by Six and escorted out of the disintegrating building,\nand the Providence task force retreats by air as the base goes up in a mushroom cloud.\nRex tells Agent Six and Dr. Holiday that he learned from Rylander that he has a brother.  \n\n10       \\&quot;The Forgotten\\&quot;                  Rick Morales              Paul Giacoppo               September 17, 2010               693-011\n---       -------------                   ------------              -------------               ------------------               -------\n\nA team of Providence soldiers led by Captain Calan, carrying an important data rod, are shot down over the \\&quot;Bug Jar\\&quot;\n(formerly Kiev, Ukraine, which has been sealed off from the rest of the world via a one-way force field bubble).\nRex, Six, and Bobo are called in to retrieve the rod and any survivors of the crew. Doctor Holiday gives Rex a secret task of collecting samples,\non the condition of a dinner date with Rex. Rex is able to secure the data rod after entering the zone,\nbut things go awry when E.V.O.s attack the trio, and they are stranded inside the Bug Jar. The E.V.O.s are being led by a faceless, four-armed E.V.O.\ncalled NoFace. Rex and the others escape from NoFace, and meet up with two of Calan\\'s team,\nwho are none too pleased with Rex\\'s carefree nature about the data-rod\\'s retrieval.\nThey lead Rex and Six to a site where NoFace is forcing Calan and another member of his team to repair the downed ship,\nusing a form of telepathy to communicate with the other E.V.O.s. After a struggle, Rex and the others make contact with Holiday,\nwho tells them to head for a hotel for extraction. As the group wait for help to arrive, NoFace leads another charge against Rex and the team,\nhoping to use the extraction as a way of escaping the Bug Jar. However, Rex manages to use Holiday\\'s sample collector\nto disable NoFace and escape with the rescue team, leaving the faceless creature and his brood still trapped. Back at Providence headquarters,\nRex pretends to have lost the data rod to tick off White Knight, earning recognition from the crew he saved when he allows them to take the credit for it\\'s retrieval.\nHoliday is happy to see Rex and the others safe, even if he didn\\'t manage to collect samples for her. She mentions it meant everything to her, except a date.\n \n11        \\&quot;Operation: Wingman\\&quot;            Chris Graham             Eugene Son                   September 24, 2010             693-012\n---        ------------------             ------------             ----------                   ------------------             -------\n\nRex is stalked by a carnivorous rabbit E.V.O. that he insulted.

White Knight concludes that there is someone behind the robberies and orders\nAgent Six to have Rex infiltrate the three criminals. Tuck leads Rex to Tuck\\'s friends Sqwydd and Cricket.\nRex can\\'t remember being a member of their gang because of memory blackouts which Tuck mentioned he suffered from frequently.\nRex also discovers that they\\'re being forced to work for an E.V.O. crime lord named Quarry.\nWhen Rex finally confronts Quarry he discovers that it was he who gave Tuck and the others to Quarry, who reveals the information on a Diary kept on a PDA.\nThis causes the others to turn on Rex. Rex, suffering from a guilt trip, goes to shut down Quarry\\'s ring,\ncausing the others to turn on Quarry after seeing Rex standing up for them and destroying the PDA when Quarry bribed him.\nQuarry and his E.V.O. servants are arrested by Providence. Rex tells White Knight that Quarry had been apprehended while Tuck, Sqwydd, and Cricket had gotten away.\nRex tells Tuck, Sqwydd, and Cricket that Providence won\\'t come after them long as they don\\'t give good reason and departs on a good note.\nBack at Providence, Rex informs Holiday and Six of his blackouts. Agent Six gives Rex a journal and pen for Rex to record\nanything that he does remember to help cope with future black outs while Dr. Holiday theorizes that the blackouts are triggered by extreme trauma.\n \n13         \\&quot;The Hunter\\&quot;                   Rick Morales              Michael                     Ryan October 8, 2010          693-008\n---         ----------                    ------------              -------                     --------------------          -------\n\nDuring a routine job in a small town neighborhood, a flea E.V.O. that Rex was in the middle of curing is destroyed by Hunter Cain,\na Punisher-styled vigilante who uses an advanced weapon known as \\&quot;Sweet Caroline\\&quot; that causes targeted Nanites to self destruct.\nHunter claims that Providence has been lying to the public for years and that the E.V.O. Crisis isn\\'t caused by nanites in every\nform of life on the planet but in fact a disease that spreads from person to person. Six is able to prevent a fight from breaking out\nbetween Rex and Hunter and when they get back to Providence, Hunter\\'s back story is explained.\nHe went insane several months ago when his wife went E.V.O. and whom is the one he first euthanized.\nSix cites Hunter as a threat because of his rallying of the public against Providence.\nMeanwhile Rex has lost his will to fight E.V.O.s after a accident in which he was attacked by civilians and injured one by mistake.\nMeanwhile a large amount of phantom like E.V.O.s are on a rampage at the docks and are immune to conventional weapons.\nHunter and his private army arrive on the scene with their specialized anti-nanite weapons and are able to fight off a large amount of the phantoms.\nRex, having finally regained his belief in humanity, arrives to fight the phantom E.V.O.s and is attacked by Hunter.\nWhile the two are alone, Hunter reveals that he spent a fortune cloning a lone phantom E.V.O. to create the small army to\nprove Providence\\'s ineffectiveness (not knowing a news team had captured his admitting the crime). After a rough battle,\nRex ties up Hunter and leaves him for Providence and, with the help of Hunter\\'s not so loyal army, Rex is able to kill off the phantom E.V.O.s.\nThe episode ends with dozens of interviews about how Rex saved lives while at least partially repairing his reputation\nand strengthening his new-found belief in humanity, but knows that another person like Hunter will take his place.  \n\n14         \\&quot;Gravity\\&quot;                    Rick Morales              Andrew Robinson               October 15, 2010             693-014\n---         -------                     ------------              ---------------               -----------------            -------\n\nDr. Holiday and small group of Providence scientists are on board a satelite station working on a modified form of nanites that deactivate regular nanites.\nThe test run is a success until ZAG-RS, the rogue AI system from the village of engineers from The Architect,\nhacks into the satelite to steal the deactivated nanite research.

With the assistance of a drone named Salvator,\nRex is able to stabilize the station with an escape pod with Rex, the surviving crew and nanites on board.\nHowever, it is eventually revealed that ZAG-RS downloaded herself into Salvator to avoid the effect of the shut down and now\nintends to leave everyone else on the satellite while she escapes to earth in Salvator with the nanites and the research.\nHowever, Rex and Dr. Holiday are able to defeat ZAG-RS by both destabilizing the station and sacrificing the nanites.\nThe episode ends with a crew member, Dr. Holiday, and Rex in an escape pod in the middle of the ocean awaiting pickup.\n\n15         \\&quot;What Lies Beneath\\&quot;           Chris Graham             Marsha Griffin                October 22, 2010             693-015\n---         -----------------            ------------             ---------------               ----------------             -------\n\nWhile making a midnight taco run with Bobo, Rex gets a call from Circe stating that there is a problem in Abysus.\nAgent Six and Dr. Holiday come along with Rex when an anomaly is detected there. Meanwhile, Bobo conducts missions that distract White Knight,\nincluding dinner, a movie, and some time at the beach. Dr. Holiday discovers that the floating goop is actually\nnanites that have become unstable and are multiplying. When a giant one-armed E.V.O. attacks, Circe,\nBiowulf, and Skalamander also appear and Six thinks its a trap, but they end up fighting the one-armed E.V.O., which dissolves.\nBiowulf cuts off Circe before she can reveal what had happened. At the Van Kleiss\\' castle,\nBiowulf explains info revolving around what would happen if anything happened to Van Kleiss.\nThey pull a scroll out of a machine that states that Rex is the key to fix Abysus. Rex agrees to run the machine to help stop the spreading of the unstable nanites.\nThis in turn happens to be a plot to revive Van Kleiss and that his force is the only thing that can keep Abysus together.\nWhen Rex discovers this, he stops the machine mid-cycle, causing the half-formed Van Kleiss to dissolve, and damages the machine.\nRex refuses to activate the machine, so he tries to cure the nanites, but is overloaded with nanites.\nDr. Holiday suggests to Rex to talk to the nanites, and in the process, the nanites responded.\nHowever, instead of receding, the nanites contract, causing the castle to fall apart, putting Six, Holiday, Circe, Biowulf, and Skalamander in danger.\nLeft with no option, Rex repairs the machine, activates it, and, while noticing something different, revives Van Kleiss.\nOnce revived, Van Kleiss, recedes the nanites into himself, growing larger in the process, saves Biowulf and Skalamander,\nbut refuses to save Rex\\'s loved ones (including Circe), unless Rex joins Van Kleiss. Left with no choice, Rex agrees, and Van Kleiss re-stabilizes Abysus,\nsaving Six, Holiday and Circe. With a celebratory handshake, Rex discovers that Van Kleiss\\' nanites were changed by the reviving process,\nand cures him, making him human. Van Kleiss brags that his greatest strength was not his nanites, but his intellect, and out of nowhere,\nBreach returns, pulling Van Kleiss to safety through a portal, and the Pack escapes as well. Circe stays with the Pack, while Rex leaves,\nunable to understand girls (something that he and Six share in common).  \n\n16          \\&quot;The Swarm\\&quot;                 Sam Montes                Paul Giacoppo                  October 29, 2010            693-016\n---          ---------                  ----------                -------------                  ----------------            -------\n\nRex faces off against a group of mutant locusts that feed on metal, leaving a path of destruction behind them. However, defeating them is not an easy task as.\nWhen they are attacked, the locusts keep dividing through binary fission.\nAs the locusts rage toward China (which holds the Earth\\'s largest metal concentration, Beijing), Providence pulls out all stops to halt their advance.\nDr. Holiday comes to odds with White Knight, Six, and Rex as she strongly protests against their \\&quot;attack first, ask questions later\\&quot; policy.\nFinally, the team is forced to consult her for help when the increasing numbers of locusts destroy the Great Wall of China where Providence had made its stand.\nEventually, Dr. Holiday synthesizes a concentrated version of a pheromone tag used by the locusts to mark prey, which she sent Rex to gather.\nWhile trying to gather the pheromone, Rex almost ends up dead. However, the nanite that Dr. Rylander injected into Rex saved his life,\nand the only sample left was in his underpants (which had red motorcycles on it).\nAfter everyone had a good laugh (Dr. Holiday gave Rex his underwear in front of everyone), Providence sprays it on the locusts,\ncausing them to go berserk and attack (and devour) each other. Finally, Bobo, as revenge for Rex destroying more locusts than him,\nmakes it public that \\&quot;Providence\\'s Secret Weapon, Underwear, Saves the Day\\&quot;. Rex leaves the Providence briefing room in anger as the story runs on TV,\nwhile the other Providence agents continue to laugh at his expense.\n\n17            \\&quot;Basic\\&quot;                  Rick Morales                Scott Sonneborn                 November 5, 2010           693-017\n---            ------                  ------------                ---------------                 ----------------           -------\n\nRex decides to attend \\&quot;Providence Boot Camp\\&quot; in an attempt to beat Noah. Once the boys arrive at the camp, they must dissect E.V.O.s,\ndo sit-ups until they puke (literally), and even brush their teeth a specific way.\nWhen Rex and Noah fail a crash landing test and are ordered to do it over and over again until they do it correctly,\nthey realize this may not be as easy as they thought. Things take a turn for the worse when a cadet, Kenwyn,\nwho is angry at Rex for dropping her rank from #1, turns off the power restraint collar placed on E.V.O.s agents in training must battle.\nAs a twist, the General sends her down instead of Rex since Rex fought it eariler in the episode.\nAll the E.V.O.s, including Weaver, break loose and wreak havoc until Kenwyn works with Noah and a very helpful extra to distract the E.V.O.s so Rex can beat them.\nThese four graduate from Basic Training and Noah and Rex are seen walking down the Stone Steps, betting money on who will make it to the bottom first.  \n\n18           \\&quot;Plague\\&quot;                   Chris Graham                Tad Stones                       November 12, 2010          693-018\n---           ------                   ------------                ----------                       -----------------          -------\n\nA powerful virus has put all of North America into a deep sleep. While E.V.O.\\'s are immune, somehow Bobo has been affected,\nleaving Rex the lone agent dispatched by the White Knight to address the outbreak of emergencies.\nThough a temporary fix, Dr. Holiday manages uses electric neural stimulation to stay awake long enough to build a tracking device\ndesigned to locate the source of plague before finally succumbing to sleep. Left with no other choice,\nWhite Knight uses a protective weaponized suit to assist Rex in locating the source of the virus, an E.V.O. dubbed \\&quot;Patient Zero.\\&quot;\nAfter Rex is unable to cure Patient Zero, White Knight and Rex fight over the best way to handle the E.V.O.\nDuring the fight, White Knight reveals he is completely nanite-free. Meanwhile, the E.V.O. manifests a living incarnation of the virus,\nforcing Rex to enter the E.V.O. to cure it. Despite having his suit breached, Rex is able to get White Knight back to Providence in time to leave him nanite-free.\nAfterward, it\\'s revealed that Bobo was not actually affected by the virus,\ninstead sleeping off a massive hangover he suffered from a party he had the night of the outbreak.\n\nNOTE: This episode is loosely based on The Happening\n \n19        \\&quot;Promises, Promises\\&quot;           Sam Montes                 Man of Action                    November 19, 2010          693-019\n---        ------------------            ----------                 -------------                    -----------------          -------\n\nIt\\'s Rex\\'s birthday (more accurately the anniversary of when he first joined Providence) and Six has flashbacks about how Rex first joined Providence.\nBack when Providence was forming, captured E.V.O.s were detained only until they were disassembled on a molecular level for study.\nHowever, Dr. Holiday, an assistant at the time, believes that studying how nanites cause mutations may\none day allow for an option other than kill or contain: cure. One day, Six and his partner White Knight were called to Mexico\nto deal with a rampaging bio-mechanical E.V.O. only for the E.V.O. to collapse after being battered enough and revealed to be fourteen-year-old Rex.\nRex cures a second E.V.O. right in front of Six\\'s eyes and he brings him back to Dr. Holiday to be studied.\nDespite Rex being her all and more of her wildest dreams rolled into one, Six insists that they keep him under wraps for now.\nHowever, White Knight finds Rex and brings him to the head of E.V.O. Studies, Dr. Fell, in hopes that disassembling him will reveal\nhow his curing powers work and how to cure the entire planet all in one shot.\nHowever, Six believes that it is too big of a risk to sacrifice what they know will work for something that might work.\nWith assistance from Bobo, a recently captured E.V.O. who was holding the Kremlin hostage for caviar before his capture, Dr. Holiday is able to save Rex.\nHowever, White Knight and Six\\'s fight had caused the E.V.O. disassembly machine to overload and destroy all the nanites in White Knight\\'s body,\nbut Rex is able to save White Knight\\'s life by turning off the machine with his powers, in the process, bleaching White Knights skin and hair.\nRex\\'s curing abilities has given Providence much needed funding and White Knight is made head of Providence for his zero nanite count.\nBack in the present, Six gives Rex a TantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ inscribed with the symbol of loyalty for his birthday and states that he has its twin\n(which was given to him for his birthday the day he found Rex) and states that it is a symbol that they are going down the same path together.  \n\n20         \\&quot;Badlands\\&quot;                    Rick Morales               Eugene Son                       December 3, 2010           693-024\n---         ---------                   --------------              ----------                       ----------------           -------\n\nA large Providence convoy commanded by Six is transporting a case of unstable nanites through a desert.\nRex, Bobo, and Noah are assigned the humiliating task of transporting the force\\'s toilet paper on a beaten-up truck;\nRex is further annoyed at not being allowed to drive. After his attempt to resuscitate the truck\\'s radio backfires and fills the cabin with smoke,\nthe three stray down a side road. Meanwhile, the convoy is ambushed by a criminal gang of self-declared anarchists, led by the deranged cyborg Gatlocke.\nThe gang successfully hijacks the nanite carrier, only to discover that it is a decoy, its actual cargo being toilet paper;\nthe nanite case had been covertly loaded onto Rex\\'s truck. After some misadventures including an unsuccessful snack stop\nand an attempt to flirt with girls in a convertible, Rex, Bobo, and Noah trace their way back to the convoy route,\ncoming across the aftermath of the ambush and the waiting gang. Gatlocke demands the truck; a short brawl ensues between\nhim and Rex before the three are able to escape with the truck and one of the gang\\'s all-terrain vehicles.\nAfter a running Mad Max-style battle, the gang is defeated and Gatlocke falls into a canyon; his cybernetic parts damaged,\nhe climbs out and demands the nanites again when Providence relief forces show up. Six explains that the nanites are now inert;\nwhat he had meant by \\&quot;unstable\\&quot; was that they were vulnerable to vibration. The turmoil of battle having resulted in their deactivation,\nthey are now useless to either Providence or Gatlocke. An enraged Gatlocke takes a swing at Rex; he is knocked out cold and taken into custody.\nRex, Noah, and Bobo get back in the truck, Rex finally being allowed to drive.\n\n21          \\&quot;Payback\\&quot;                  Rick Morales                 Rob Hoegee                      December 10, 2010           693-020\n---         ---------                 --------------               ------------                     ------------------          --------\n\nRex and Noah are aboard the Keep and returning to Providence HQ when news breaks of surprise attacks against major Providence bases around the world.\nHaving lost his nature-controlling powers at Rex\\'s hands (he has apparently manage to turn himself back into a E.V.O. through a as of yet unidentified means),\nVan Kleiss is out for revenge; he personally leads the Abysus forces which board the Keep.\nRex counter attacks, but is restrained by Biowulf long enough for Van Kleiss to drain Rex of all his active nanites.\nThis alters his powers into the mirror image of Rex\\'s: as Rex is able to cure E.V.O\\'s, Van Kleiss is now able to create them, which he demonstrates on Captain Calan.\nThe depowered Rex is thrown from the Keep by Biowulf, but is rescued in midair by Six\\'s jumpjet.\nVan Kleiss is determined to destroy Providence once and for all; the Keep is rammed into the HQ tower, and a heavy battle develops.\nRex, Noah and Bobo escape in a jumpjet to Purgatory Base, where Rex risks his life by immersing himself in active nanites in order to reactivate his powers.\nThe procedure seemingly activates the large, unusual nanite that Dr. Rylander had injected into him in Dark Passage.\nProvidence HQ is about to fall; Van Kleiss makes it into the situation room, defeats Six, and dispatches Biowulf and Skalamander after White Knight and Dr. Holiday.\nRex reappears and attacks Van Kleiss, manifesting a new, whip-like build granted by Rylander\\'s nanite; he is able to use its abilities to disable Van Kleiss.\nMeanwhile Holiday takes down Skalamander by releasing her E.V.O. sister, and White Knight lures Biowulf into a trap.\nVan Kleiss is snatched to safety by an E.V.O., while Breach sets bombs throughout Providence as a diversion.\nRex finds he is able to shut down the entire HQ with his new powers.\nProvidence takes Biowulf, Skalamander, and many other E.V.O.s left behind into custody; Rex, back to his old self, cures Captain Calan.\nRex is warmly commended by White Knight and confidently observes that while Van Kleiss may be back and more powerful than ever, so is he, and the war is not over yet.  \n\n=====================================================================================================================\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=====================================================\n----------------------------\n=============\n\nSpoken Language:- English\n---------\n\nCast\n------\n\nSeries cast summary:\n\n Daryl Sabara  ...
