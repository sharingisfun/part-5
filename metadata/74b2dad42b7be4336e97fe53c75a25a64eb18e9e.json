Now, Debbie deepens our shadow work and shows how our shadow side holds the key to our happiness. Each of us has a shadow that whispers stories of our own self-defeating fears to us-for example: that we arenÃ¢â‚¬Â²t enough, that we are unworthy of being loved, that we will be deserted by those whom we care about. Debbie guides us to hear those stories and find the positive message within each of them. She shows how understanding our own shadow side can lead us to lives of tremendous fulfillment and peace. Full of case studies and exercises, this book complements her first book on shadow work, which has sold almost half a million copies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b2dad42b7be4336e97fe53c75a25a64eb18e9e","amp;dn":"The+Secret+of+the+Shadow+-+Debbie+Ford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b2dad42b7be4336e97fe53c75a25a64eb18e9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,178,218,212,43,123,228,51,110,151,254,83,199,90,37,166,78,177,142,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
