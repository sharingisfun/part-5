Malone\nTorrent file name: The Intel Trinity (Michael S. Malone) Retail epub [Itzy]\nPublisher: HarperBusiness (July 15, 2014)\nSold by: HarperCollins Publishers\nGenre: Non-fiction\nFormat: Retail .epub\n\nBased on unprecedented access to the corporationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s archives, The Intel Trinity is the first full history of Intel CorporationÃ¢â‚¬â€the essential company of the digital ageÃ¢â‚¬â€ told through the lives of the three most important figures in the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history: Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove.\n\nOften hailed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“most important company in the world,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Intel remains, more than four decades after its inception, a defining company of the global digital economy. The legendary inventors of the microprocessor-the single most important product in the modern world-Intel today builds the tiny Ã¢â‚¬Å“enginesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that power almost every intelligent electronic device on the planet.\n\nBut the true story of Intel is the human story of the trio of geniuses behind it. Michael S. Malone reveals how each brought different things to Intel, and at different times. Noyce, the most respected high tech figure of his generation, brought credibility (and money) to the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founding; Moore made Intel the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technological leader; and Grove, has relentlessly driven the company to ever-higher levels of success and competitiveness. Without any one of these figures, Intel would never have achieved its historic success; with them, Intel made possible the personal computer, Internet, telecommunications, and the personal electronics revolutions.\n\nThe Intel Trinity is not just the story of IntelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary past; it also offers an analysis of the formidable challenges that lie ahead as the company struggles to maintain its dominance, its culture, and its legacy.\n\nWith eight pages of black-and-white photos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa62887ce03e6f6b26eb61e609fe58bfd93ac49","amp;dn":"The+Intel+Trinity+%28Michael+S.+Malone%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa62887ce03e6f6b26eb61e609fe58bfd93ac49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,166,40,135,206,3,230,246,178,110,182,30,96,159,229,139,253,147,172,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
