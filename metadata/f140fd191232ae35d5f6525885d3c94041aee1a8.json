This book will pull information and expertise from real world scenarios so as to maximize practical learning. It will explain the settings and configurations needed to have a successful desktop virtualization solution as well as the 'why' behind the decisions\n\nThis book is not meant to replace the official Administration or Installation Guides for VMware View or ThinApp published by the great people at VMware.
