The tracks &quot;Fat Girl&quot;, &quot;Stripper Girl&quot; and &quot;Hell's On Fire&quot; are re-recordings from the 2003 debut album Hole Patrol while &quot;Death to All But Metal&quot; is a re-recording from their 2004 contribution to the Metal Sludge compilation Hey That's What I Call Sludge! Vol. 1. Unlike the debut album and their Metal Sludge compilation tracks, Feel the Steel is composed entirely of songs, lacking any spoken word comedy skits present on earlier releases. The video for &quot;Death to All But Metal&quot; features comedian Sarah Silverman. The album debuted on #123 and peaked at #98 on the Billboard 200 chart and peaked at #1 on the Billboard Top Comedy Albums chart.\n\nThe album was released June 8, 2009 in the UK, October 6 in North America and December 11 in Australia.\n\nAll songs written by Steel Panther, except &quot;Girl From Oklahoma&quot; co-written with Dean Cameron\n\n&quot;Death to All But Metal&quot; (featuring Corey Taylor) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n&quot;Asian Hooker&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:02\n&quot;Community Property&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n&quot;Eyes of a Panther&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n&quot;Fat Girl (Thar She Blows)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:38\n&quot;Eatin' Ain't Cheatin'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n&quot;Party All Day (Fuck All Night)&quot; (featuring Justin Hawkins) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03\n&quot;Turn Out the Lights&quot; (featuring M.
