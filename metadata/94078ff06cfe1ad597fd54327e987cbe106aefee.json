It was written and produced by Eminem himself, along with longtime collaborator Jeff Bass, one half of the production duo Bass Brothers. The song was largely written during the filming of 8 Mile, including several elements written entirely on set by Eminem. The song largely plays to the themes of the film, as it is largely based around, and written from the viewpoint of, the character of Jimmy &quot;B-Rabbit&quot; Smith, Jr., the role taken on by Eminem in the film, and the events of the film itself.\nThe song's accompanying music video, directed by Eminem himself, manager Paul Rosenberg and Phillip G. Atwell, was released on October 7, 2002. The video is a mixture of several scenarios, largely including several scenes from 8 Mile, however it also contains scenes addressing problems the real life Eminem has addressed, as well as &quot;B-Rabbit&quot;'s difficulties, including the ostracism by rap communities towards him due to his color, and his difficult personal life.The music video for &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; was filmed in Detroit, Michigan, and thus contains numerous shots of the city, including the Ambassador Bridge. The video is a mixture of multiple scenarios, including scenes from and reminiscent of the movie 8 Mile, and Eminem rapping next to the &quot;8 Mile Rd. Mobile Court&quot; sign that appears on the cover of the movie's soundtrack.It contains scenes focusing on Rabbit's and the real life Eminem's character, for example, the difficulties he has to face while rapping, the insult and booing of crowds as he is a white rapper and the trouble he has to face due to his alcoholic mother and people he hangs out with.\n\nMEDIA INFO\n\nGENERAL\n\nComplete name                            : Eminem - Lose Yourself[720p x264]-{BFAB}.mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFile size                                : 50.5 MB\nDuration                                 : 5mn 17s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 334 Kbps\nWriting application                      : HandBrake 0.9.8\nWriting library                          : libmkv 0.6.5\n\nVIDEO\n\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;82caebe5eac2ceb1acb0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 6 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 5mn 17s\nNominal bit rate                         : 1 200 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 528 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.40:1\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.059\nWriting library                          : x264 core 120\nLanguage                                 : English\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\nColor primaries                          : BT.709\nTransfer characteristics                 : BT.709\nMatrix coefficients                      : BT.709\n\nAUDIO\n\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 5mn 17s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nTHUMBNAILS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/nxvsFtP7/1376200876_thumbnails.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/nxvsFtP7/1376200876_thumbnails.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNotes:\n\n* Recommended to use latest version VLC Media Player.\n* Install shark007 codecs in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC Media Player users).\n* Alternatively, install Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is coupled with Community Center Codec Pack and play on Windows Media Player Classic.\n\nEncoder Notes: Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide DVDScr, R5, DVDRips, BluRay, Direct Audio, Early Music\nReleases, Seedboxes, Links, Dedicated Servers anything u can provide, Advance / Promo CDs/DVDs.
