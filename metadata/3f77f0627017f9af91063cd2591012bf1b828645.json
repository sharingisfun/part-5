But of course many thousands remained behind as experts and consultants (aka CIA and MOSSAD agents). \n\nThe war has accomplished its objectives; i.e. destruction of the country, death of hundreds of thousands civilians, and displacement of millions. The Christians and other minorities, who used to live there peacefully, cannot live there anymore. And the worst outcome of that war is that Iraq is delivered on a plate to the pro-Iranian factions. A new monster is created that threatening its neighbors and the world. The seeds for the next war are already sown.
