This music swings in a boogaloo/Latin soul/'60s sort of way. Swing by definition means not staying in one place. Some of Bobo's music slow, some is fast, some is sappy, and some is just plain greasy. &quot;Fried Neck Bones and Some Homefries,&quot; anyone? Open your ears as Bobo tackles Hugh Masekela's &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot; and Bacharach's and David's &quot;The Look of Love&quot; (with the bandleader tackling vocals as well as percussion). &quot;Evil Ways&quot; and &quot;Spanish Grease&quot; are a couple of songs that any Santana fan will recognize, but Bobo stamps them with his daring and idiosyncratic charm.\n\nWhatever the meaning of the word &quot;talkin,&quot; this is still a most valuable release because it succinctly sums up Willie Bobo's Verve recordings, most of which have yet to see the light of the laser. By this time, Bobo had followed Mongo Santamaria into the marketplace as an energetic exponent of the Latin boogaloo, even scoring a minor hit with &quot;Spanish Grease.&quot; But Bobo went even further than Mongo toward an accommodation with the '60s scene, adding the R&amp;B-oriented electric rhythm guitar of Sonny Henry, dropping the piano, incorporating strings and even an occasional graceful vocal now and then. With Bobo's galvanic congas and timbales swinging at all times, few CDs by a single artist capture the ambience of late-'60s jazz radio in the evening as well as this one . . .\n\n\nWILLIE BOBO\n\nTalkin Verve     1997\n\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nReleased on Verve albums between 1965 and 1968:\n\nSpanish Grease, Willie Bobo, 1965 \nUno Dos Tres 1-2-3, Willie Bobo, 1966 \nJuicy, Willie Bobo, 1967 \nBobo Motion, Willie Bobo, 1967 \nA New Dimension, Willie Bobo, 1968\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:563b4dcbba9e18edad1b958acae67ec36a0bd0f7","amp;dn":"Willie+Bobo+-+Talkin%27+Verve+-+%5B1965+-+1968%5D+-+Latin+Jazz+-+320Kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"563b4dcbba9e18edad1b958acae67ec36a0bd0f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,59,77,203,186,158,24,237,173,27,149,138,202,230,126,195,106,11,208,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
