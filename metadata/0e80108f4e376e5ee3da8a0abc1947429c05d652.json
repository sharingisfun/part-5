Not that there's anything wrong with that. After all, \nCreative Assembly's popular strategy franchise has gotten bigger and better with every release. \nHowever, in copying the formula of Total War, Pyro Studios, the designers of Imperial Glory, \nhave missed the small nuances and details that made the Total War games, in particular Medieval and Rome, something special. \nThat leaves Imperial Glory feeling very much like an uneven first step, which is a pity, because it does have a lot of promise. \n\n\nSpecifications\n\nLanguange.........: English\nOperating system..: Windows 2000 / Windows XP\nProcessor.........: 1 GHZ pentium 3/4 , AMD ATHLON Or Simllar\nInternal Memory...: 256mb or 512mb\n3D Videocard......: 128MB RAM / DirectX 9\nCd-Rom............: DVDROM\nHarddisk..........: 2.5 GB\nInfo..............: http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/imperial-glory-pc/4505-9696_7-31238907.html?tag=rnav\n\nCover.............: Yes\n\n\nWORKS 100 % TESTED ON 2 PCÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´S\n\nNO CD-KEY NEEDED\n\n\n\n\nDON T HIT AND RUN \nDon`t quit after you finished the download, but keep seeding!\n\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e80108f4e376e5ee3da8a0abc1947429c05d652","amp;dn":"Imperial+Glory+%5B2005%5D+%5BPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e80108f4e376e5ee3da8a0abc1947429c05d652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,128,16,143,78,55,110,94,227,218,138,10,188,25,71,66,156,5,214,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
