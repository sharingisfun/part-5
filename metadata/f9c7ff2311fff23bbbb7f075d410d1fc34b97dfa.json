They were formed in late-1975 in Brixton, London by multi-instrumentalists Charles Bullen (guitar, clarinet, viola, vocals, tapes), Charles Hayward (percussion, keyboards, vocals, tapes) and Gareth Williams (keyboard, guitar, bass, vocals, tapes). Their music touched on numerous different styles and genres, but was always confrontational and politically charged.\n\nBox Set 2006:\n1. This Heat, 1978\n2. Deceit, 1981\n3.
