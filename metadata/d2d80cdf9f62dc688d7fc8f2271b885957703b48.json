LaFleur\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nSeries: The Wheelock's Latin Series\nAuthor: Richard A. LaFleur\nPaperback: 608 pages\nPublisher: Collins Reference; 7 edition (June 7, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0061997226\nISBN-13: 978-0061997228\n\nThe classic WheelockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Latin remains the most highly regarded and bestselling single-volume, introductory Latin textbook of its kind. Now in its seventh edition, WheelockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Latin retains its signature core of authentic Latin readings, taken not only from classical literature, drama, and poetry, but also from  inscriptions, artifacts, and even graffiti showing the ancient RomansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ everyday use of Latin: Latin as a living language. With expanded vocabulary sections, tightly retooled comprehension and discussion questions, and vivid photos and illustrations, WheelockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Latin 7th Edition is the essential resource for students beginning their journey into the heart of the classical world.\n\nBook Description\n\nFor nearly sixty years, Wheelock's Latin has remained the opitmus liber of beginning Latin textbooks.\n\nWhen Professor Frederic M. Wheelock's Latin first appeared in 1956, the reviews extolled its thoroughness, organization, and conciseness; one reviewer predicted that the book &quot;might well become the standard text&quot; for introducing students to elementary Latin. Now, nearly six decades later, that prediction has certainly proved accurate.\n\nThis new edition of Wheelock's Latin has all of the features, many of them improved and expanded, that have made it the bestselling single-volume beginning Latin textbook:\n\n* 40 chapters with grammatical explanations and readings drawn from the works of Rome's major prose and verse writers;\n\n* Self-tutorial exercises, each with an answer key, for independent study;\n\n* An extensive EnglishÃ¢â‚¬â€œLatin/LatinÃ¢â‚¬â€œEnglish vocabulary section;\n\n* A rich selection of original Latin readingsÃ¢â‚¬â€unlike other Latin textbooks, which contain primarily made-up texts;\n\n* Etymological aids, maps, and dozens of images illustrating aspects of the classical culture and mythology presented in the chapter readings.\n\nAlso included are expanded notes on the literary passages, comments on vocabulary, and translation tips; new comprehension and discussion questions; and new authentic classical Latin readings, including Roman graffiti, in every chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2d80cdf9f62dc688d7fc8f2271b885957703b48","amp;dn":"Wheelock%27s+Latin+7th+Edition+-+epub+and+kindle+mobi+formats","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2d80cdf9f62dc688d7fc8f2271b885957703b48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,216,12,223,159,98,220,104,141,127,200,242,39,27,136,89,87,112,59,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
