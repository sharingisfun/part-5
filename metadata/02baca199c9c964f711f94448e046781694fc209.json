Count Dracula knows that if he fails to drink a required amount of pure virgin's [pronounced &quot;wirgin's&quot;] blood, it's time to move into a permanent coffin. His assistant (Renfield?) suggests that the Count and he pick up his coffin and take a road trip to Italy, where families are known to be particularly religious, and therefore should be an excellent place to search for a virgin bride. They do, only to encounter a family with not one, but FOUR virgins, ready for marriage. The Count discovers one-by-one that the girls are not as pure as they say they are, meanwhile a handsome servant/Communist begins to observe strange behaviour from the girls who do spend the night with the Count. It's a race for Dracula to discover who's the real virgin, before he either dies from malnourishment or from the wooden stake of the Communist!\n\nDirector: Paul Morrissey\nWriter: Paul Morrissey \n\nRLS iNFO\n\nBlood.for.Dracula.1974.DVDRip.x264.AC3-FORGiVEN\n\nSUPPLiED BY: nateretzlaff (thanks)\nENCODED BY: FORGiVEN\nOUR RELEASEDATE: 109-07-2013\nDiSCS: 1 DiSk\nRUNTiME: 1h 43mm\nFiLE SiZE: 1330 Mb\nSOURCE: DVD5 / NTSC\nViDEO FORMAT: x264\nASPECT RATiO: 720 x 384\nViDEO BiTRATE: 1700 kbps\nAUDiO FORMAT: 128 kb/s AC3 1ch\nAUDiO LANGUAGE: English\nSUBTiTLES: None\n\nNfo - FORGiVEN @2013\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071233/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02baca199c9c964f711f94448e046781694fc209","amp;dn":"Blood.for.Dracula.1974.DVDRip.x264.AC3-FORGiVEN+%5BPublicHash%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02baca199c9c964f711f94448e046781694fc209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,186,202,25,156,156,150,79,113,31,148,68,142,4,103,129,105,79,194,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
