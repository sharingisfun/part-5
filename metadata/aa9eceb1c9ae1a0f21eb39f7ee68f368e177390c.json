Not without reason was the Colt .45 called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the equalizer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A frail dance-hall hostess with one in her possession was now fully able to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Hammill, Chuck. From Crossbows To Cryptography: Techno-Thwarting The State. Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987)\n\n\tThe problem with shooting at people is they often shoot back. SEMTA solves this problem by keeping at least one party out of the line of fire.\n\n\tRemotely controlled tanks are over 80 years old.  &quot;Teletanks were a series of wireless remotely controlled unmanned tanks produced in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and early 1940s. They saw their first combat use in the Winter War, at the start of World War II.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletank\n\nDesign Goals\n\n\tSEMTA is designed to kill people. This must not be done unintentionally and it must not be done under the intention of someone other than the operator. Therefore, the communications link between the operator and the SEMTA must be secure. This will be accomplished using the OpenVPN.\n\tSEMTA is economical. It uses off-the-self components. It is lightly armored, but easily repairable.\n\tSEMTA is miniature. SEMTAs should be easily palletizable for shipping. The current design allows for dozens of SEMTAs to be shipped in a standard twenty foot shipping container.\n\tSEMTA is a tank. [..]\n\tSEMTA is an architecture. It is made of available materials. With a basic understanding of the design, any component may be substituted for a more readily available component.\n\n\n\nzip file includes Geomagic Design Parts, Assemblies and Drawings. Drawings are also in PDF format. Documentation is in abw and html formats.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa9eceb1c9ae1a0f21eb39f7ee68f368e177390c","amp;dn":"SEMTA%3A+Secure%2C+Economical%2C+Mini+Tank+Architecture+by+Anonymous+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa9eceb1c9ae1a0f21eb39f7ee68f368e177390c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,158,206,177,201,174,26,15,33,235,57,247,238,104,243,104,225,119,57,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
