In June of 1778, the world turns upside-down. The British army withdraws from Philadelphia, George Washington prepares to move from Valley Forge in pursuit, and Jamie Fraser comes back from the dead to discover that his best friend has married JamieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife. The ninth Earl of Ellesmere discovers to his horror that he is in fact the illegitimate son of the newly-resurrected Jamie Fraser (a rebel _and_ a Scottish criminal!) and JamieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nephew Ian Murray discovers that his new-found cousin has an eye for IanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Quaker betrothed.\n\nMeanwhile, Claire Fraser deals with an asthmatic duke, Benedict Arnold, and the fear that one of her husbands may have murdered the other. And in the 20th century, Jamie and ClaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter Brianna is thinking that things are probably easier in the 18th century: her son has been kidnapped, her husband has disappeared into the past, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s facing a vicious criminal with nothing but a stapler in her hand. Fortunately, her daughter has a miniature cricket bat and her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pragmatism.\n\nThe best of historical fiction with a Moebius twist, WRITTEN IN MY OWN HEARTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S BLOOD weaves the fibers of a familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life through the tapestry of historical drama.\n\nNarrated by: Davina Porter\n\nBitrate: 118 kbps\n\n[Unabridged]\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2afb443981b7476eabd21fb0b642f081c97e0db","amp;dn":"Outlander+%238%3A+Written+in+My+Own+Heart%26rsquo%3Bs+Blood+By+Diana+Gab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2afb443981b7476eabd21fb0b642f081c97e0db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,175,180,67,152,27,116,118,234,189,33,251,11,100,47,8,28,151,224,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
