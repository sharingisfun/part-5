And his daring interpretations of ancient myths are enhanced by his brilliance as a lyricist, for Euripides' choral odes are among the most beautiful ever written. Reading plays such as these, it is not difficult to appreciate Aristotle's admiration of him as the most 'tragic' of the Greek poets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1debb15d70539d2145398eb2efa4d59079788680","amp;dn":"Medea+and+Other+Plays+%28Penguin+Classics%29+-+Euripides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1debb15d70539d2145398eb2efa4d59079788680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,235,177,93,112,83,157,33,69,57,142,178,239,164,213,144,121,120,134,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
