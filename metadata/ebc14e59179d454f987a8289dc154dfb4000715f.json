Friends is the group's 1986 debut album, and it summarizes all of the band's strengths. Although not as goth-inflected as the Bolshoi's Giant EP, Friends is still very dark. Trevor Tanner's lyrics unflinchingly relate tales of hypocrisy in &quot;A Way&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning.&quot; In &quot;A Way,&quot; a family tries to hide that they once forced their daughter to work as a prostitute: &quot;Money's scarce/But family honor/Brings it home, brings it home/And down the shop, the tongues they snicker,&quot; Tanner sings with empathy. &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; like XTC's &quot;Dear God,&quot; is a scathing attack on organized religion. However, Tanner's target isn't God; it's going to church. &quot;I remember when I was young/Feeling sick on Sunday morning,&quot; Tanner reminisces. While it may seem blasphemous to some, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; offers a realistic perspective; Tanner sounds like a bitter former altar boy, disillusioned by the faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade of innocence of the people around him. Paul Clark's moody, nostalgic piano paints the images described by Tanner's words. &quot;Romeo in Clover&quot; and &quot;Books on the Bonfire&quot; revisit the glum, whirling guitars of the Bolshoi's past, echoing the Psychedelic Furs and Bauhaus.\n\nTracks:\n\n01 Away 4:58 \n02 Modern Man 5:35 \n03 Someone's Daughter 4:04 \n04 Sunday Morning 6:32 \n05 Looking for a Life to Lose 4:44 \n06 Romeo in Clover (Call Girls) 5:35 \n07 Books on the Bonfire 4:58 \n08 Pardon Me 4:34 \n09 Fat and Jealous 4:06 \n10 Waspy 5:11 \n11 A Funny Thing 3:53","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc14e59179d454f987a8289dc154dfb4000715f","amp;dn":"The+Bolshoi+-+Friends+%5BNew+Wave%2C+Gothic+1986%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc14e59179d454f987a8289dc154dfb4000715f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,193,78,89,23,157,69,79,152,122,130,137,220,21,77,251,64,0,113,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
