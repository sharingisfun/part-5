Abair adds a refreshingly unique voice to an exciting new generation of crossover artists who are, like her, powerful instrumentalists as well as thought-provoking singer/songwriters. Her singles have hit number one over and over again on the Radio &amp; Records charts ( including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLucyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, from the album, It Just Happens That Way, one of the longest running # 1 singles ever for a debut artist ) and she continues to sell out everywhere on tour. Abair is the host of the nationally syndicated radio show, Chill With Mindi Abair featuring cutting edge music by artists such as Air, Moby, Zero 7 and remixes of classic jazz titles. She has toured and/or recorded with a wide range of artists including: MANDY MOORE, KEB MO, LEE RITENOUR, BOBBY LYLE, THE BACKSTREET BOYS, and DURAN DURAN. She also opened for JOSH GROBAN on his 2004 sold out fall tour. \n\nBalancing bluesy, knowing ballads, uptempo saxophone instrumentals, and straight-up pop tuneage, Mindy AbairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2008 album is a glossy, cross-genre treat. While jazz purists may take exception to her overly sweet sax technique, pop fans will revel in the gritty tone of her vocals and songwriting smarts. \n\nTrack List \n01  Smile \n02  On And On \n03  Out Of The Blue \n04  Stars \n05  F.L.A.
