Love Shack (Big Radio Mix)\n\nBy Johnny Heering\n&quot;Love Shack&quot; was just about my favorite song from 1989. All five remixes here are really great. I especially like the 12&quot; Mix, which used samples from the Temptations &quot;Ain't Too Proud To Beg&quot;. The A Cappella mix is a lot of fun, too. &quot;Channel Z&quot; is the other song here. It's good, but not as good as &quot;Love Shack&quot;. This just might be the best CD single ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656275f0103ee8e29d39fceb98bafddd45c79a02","amp;dn":"B-52s+-+Love+Shack+Mix+Collection+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+Channel+Z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656275f0103ee8e29d39fceb98bafddd45c79a02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,98,117,240,16,62,232,226,157,57,252,235,152,186,253,221,69,199,154,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
