His latest idea is honesty, e.g. &quot;Volvos, Yes they are boxy, but they're safe&quot;. This doesn't go down too well with the boss, so Emory is sent to a psychiatric hospital to 'recover'. Meanwhile, back at the office, Emory's work is accidentally sent to the printers. His ads are a huge success. But now Emory has fallen for Kathy (another patient) and so doesn't want to leave.\n \n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nA comedy about truth in advertising.  Inside every normal person something is waiting to get out.
