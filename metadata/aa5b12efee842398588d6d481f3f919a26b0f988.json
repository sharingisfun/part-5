Relentless) \n\nFrom Magic Ball Network:\nLittle Big Adventure (LBA for short) was first released at the end of 1994. It was released in Europe by Electronic Arts and in the USA under the name 'Relentless' by Activision. LBA sold over 400.000 copies worldwide in the first release. LBA was the first game created under the label of Adeline Software International. The game was release in two versions, a CD-Rom version and a diskette version. The CD-Rom version has full motion video, high quality music and speech.\nThe game\n\nDowntown Citadel Island\nThe game is viewed from a 3D isometric perspective (the game field is rotated 45 degrees). All characters and vehicles are real 3D polygon based objects, so they move very smoothly. The rest of the game is sprite based. The game field is devided in scenes (a small piece of the whole game that is active). So when you are in one scene nothing happens in the other scenes. Click to enlargeEverytime you walk out of a scene into a new one the game is saved automatically. \nFinding Zoe\nAfter completion of certain tasks you will be treated with an awesome full motion video sequence. All the text in the game is also spoken (CD-Rom version only). The game world is very vast, there are 11 diffirent islands and over 120 scenes to visit. You will visit places like a desert, snow mountain, underground village, rebellion island, etc. Almost every character you see in the game is interactive, the world itself is also very interactive, you can search trach bins, closets, etc.\n\n\n\nLittle Big Adventure 2 aka. Twinsen's Odyssey:\n \nFrom Magic Ball Network:\nThe sequal to LBA\\Relentless is called LBA2 in Europe and Twinsen's Odyssey in the rest of the world.
