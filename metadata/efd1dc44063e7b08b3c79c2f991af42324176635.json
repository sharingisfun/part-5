The heavily revised Fifth Edition offers greater emphasis on the role that domestic politics and institutions (both formal and informal) play in shaping American foreign policy. A consistent strategic framework (the four Ps: Power, Peace, Prosperity, and Principles) keeps students thinking analytically about policy decisions. And new chapters on key geopolitical regions apply the core concepts from both spheres to the issues that are most relevant today, including the rise of China, the consequences of the euro crisis, and the recent wars in the Middle East","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd1dc44063e7b08b3c79c2f991af42324176635","amp;dn":"American+Foreign+Policy%2C+5E+Jentleson+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D%7BHTD15%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd1dc44063e7b08b3c79c2f991af42324176635","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,209,220,68,6,62,123,8,179,199,156,47,153,26,244,35,36,23,102,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
