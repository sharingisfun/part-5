In 2004, Rolling Stone described him as, in Senegal and much of Africa, &quot;perhaps the most famous singer alive.&quot; He helped develop a style of popular music in Senegal, known by its Wolof language name of mbalax.\nMbalax is a blend of the country's traditional griot percussion and praise-singing with the Afro-Cuban and Haitian kompa arrangements and flavors which made the return trip from the Caribbean to West Africa in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s and have flourished in West Africa ever since. Beginning in the mid-1970s the resulting mix was modernized with a gloss of more complex indigenous Senegalese dance rhythms, roomy and melodic guitar and saxophone solos, chattering talking-drum soliloquies and, on occasion, Sufi-inspired Muslim religious chant. This created a new music which was at turns nostalgic, restrained and stately, or celebratory, explosively syncopated and funky. Younger Senegalese musicians steeped in Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, James Brown, and the whole range of American jazz, soul, and rock music, which Senegal's cosmopolitan capital, Dakar, had enthusiastically absorbed, were rediscovering their heritage and seeking out traditional performers, particularly singers and talking drummers, to join their bands. (The griotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½musicians, praise-singers and storyteller-historiansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½comprise a distinct hereditary caste in Wolof society and throughout West Africa.) As it emerged from this period of fruitful musical turbulence, mbalax would eventually find in Youssou N'Dour the performer who has arguably had more to do with its shaping than any other individual.\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks, thanks and thanks so mutch........!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf6e2bb59127de93810d084a4903d6515e59612f","amp;dn":"Youssou+Ndour-Dakar-Kingston-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf6e2bb59127de93810d084a4903d6515e59612f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,110,43,181,145,39,222,147,129,13,8,74,73,3,214,81,94,89,97,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
