TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not shy or misanthropic. Rather, they tend to be reflectiveÃ¢â‚¬â€they think before they talk. They focus intensely on a few things rather than broadly on a lot of things. And they need time alone to recharge. Because theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been told networking is all about small talk, big numbers and constant contact, they assume itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d9737bd3012054324cef65797e16a0f1bf1b03b","amp;dn":"Networking+for+People+Who+Hate+Networking+-+Devora+Zack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d9737bd3012054324cef65797e16a0f1bf1b03b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,151,55,189,48,18,5,67,36,206,246,87,151,225,106,15,27,241,176,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
