I see torrents here with video of French in Action, but nobody offers audio of this course and pdfs. This course was meant as video and audio course.\n\nFrench In Action: a video instructional series in French for college and high school classrooms and adult learners; 52 half-hour video programs. &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis series uses active participation to increase fluency in French, while introducing French culture. Pierre Capretz?s proven language-immersion method is presented within a humorous teleplay with native speakers of all ages and backgrounds. The storyline of an American student and a young Frenchwoman's adventures in Paris and the French countryside is reinforced by Dr. Capretz?s on-camera instruction. The series is also appropriate for teacher professional development.\n\nProduced by Yale University and WGBH Boston with Wellesley College. 1987.\n\nISBN: 0-89776-394-7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de0a162eed2cbe525b3a1ff7d23251e76f57c8b6","amp;dn":"French+in+Action+-+audio+and+pdfs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de0a162eed2cbe525b3a1ff7d23251e76f57c8b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,10,22,46,237,44,190,82,91,58,31,247,210,50,81,231,111,87,200,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
