Otherwise PS3 or PC Users will not be able to experience 5.1 audio as you cannot bitstream AAC5.1 for 99% of the products.\n\n\n5.1+ Users ~&gt; MAKE SURE TO SELECT 2ND AUDIO TRACK/STREAM\n\n\nPC Users with 5.1/6.1/7.1 Surround:\n\nDepending on your configuration, VLC should automatically enable 5.1/6.1/7.1 playback, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1 (if the movie is encoded with 6.1 or 7.1, either of these 2 will be shown instead of 5.1)\n\nIf 5.1/6.1/7.1 isn't selected by default, and you do have 5.1/6.1/7.1 system, ensure your windows sound configuration is setup correctly by navigating to your windows control panel ~ Sound and then selecting the primary audio device followed by clicking the CONFIGURE button below, follow the steps to ensure whichever setup you have that the mode is fully enabled and operating properly (you can run the speaker test).\n\nPC Users with 2.0/2.1 Stereo:\n\nDepending on your configuration, VLC should automatically enable 2.0 playback, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 2.0\n\nIf 5.1/6.1/7.1 is selected by default, and you do not have this type of system, ensure your windows sound configuration is setup correctly by navigating to your windows control panel ~ Sound and then selecting the primary audio device followed by clicking the CONFIGURE button below, follow the steps to ensure 2.0 Stereo mode is fully enabled only.\n\nKeep in mind, that you can still select in VLC while using stereo speakers the 5.1/6.1/7.1 modes to potentially experience a much better balanced sound environment at the likely cost of volume. Doing this is usually for those with powerful Stereo equipment however. In the rare case that you are already experiencing low volumes or poor sound, there is a remote possibility that selecting this mode may also BOOST your quality/volume. It is EXTREMELY difficult to predict the nature of the millions of sound configurations as well as how they will react under specific environments, not to mention the fact that millions of people may have alternative decoders, filters and various different media players that may severely impact the end results, and therefore cannot be ignored but also cannot be predicted either. Either way, the Encoded audio in this video has identical levels/volumes/balancing and channel mapping to that of the physical bluray for the best possible results for an overall excellent experience for everyone.\n\n\nScreenshot Previews:\n                             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img34/2354/ps47.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img34/2354/ps47.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img9/8238/lkji.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img9/8238/lkji.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img138/9500/xk7l.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img138/9500/xk7l.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/9228/oib1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/9228/oib1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img31/101/ngh5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img31/101/ngh5.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img46/4922/xkce.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img46/4922/xkce.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img841/5329/03ns.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img841/5329/03ns.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img853/4356/b1bv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img853/4356/b1bv.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/7984/4n74.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/7984/4n74.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img7/2043/ygz4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img7/2043/ygz4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease, be patient with seeding...\n\nEnjoy ;)\n\nFeel free to leave a + vote and a comment, Thank You!\n\n\nJudas's Note: Just Cleaning up some Movies I've had Encoded for ages...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:278322ebb82dc601b2d89b4257441501ea7fd44c","amp;dn":"Punisher+War+Zone+%282008%29+1080p+5.1+BrRip+x264+-+Judas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"278322ebb82dc601b2d89b4257441501ea7fd44c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,131,34,235,184,45,198,1,178,216,155,66,87,68,21,1,234,127,212,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
