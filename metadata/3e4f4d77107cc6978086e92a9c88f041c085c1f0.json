He shows how spirituality today combines the enlightenment of the East, which excels at cultivating higher states of consciousness, with the enlightenment of the West, which offers developmental and psychodynamic psychology. Each contributes key components to a more integral spirituality. \n\nOn the basis of this integral framework, a radically new role for the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s religions is proposed. Because these religions have such a tremendous influence on the worldview of the majority of the earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s population, they are in a privileged position to address some of the biggest conflicts we face. By adopting a more integral view, the great religions can act as facilitators of human development: from magic to mythic to rational to pluralistic to integralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and to a global society that honors and includes all the stations of life along the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4f4d77107cc6978086e92a9c88f041c085c1f0","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%2FPDF%5D+Ken+Wilber+-+Integral+Spirituality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4f4d77107cc6978086e92a9c88f041c085c1f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,79,77,119,16,124,198,151,128,134,233,42,156,136,240,65,192,133,193,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
