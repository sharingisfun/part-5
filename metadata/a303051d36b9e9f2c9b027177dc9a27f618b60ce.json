Fibers are very important in the biology of both plants and animals for holding tissues together. Plants yielding fibers have been only second to food plants in their usefulness to humans and their influence on the furthering of civilization. Textiles stand next to agriculture as an income generation activity for most of the rural population. The structure of the fabric is as much a determining factor in its functions, as it is the choice of raw material. Some structures of the fabric lend themselves to any specific end use where as many other structures are versatile lending them to a variety of functions and end users. Good understandings of simple woven structures make it possible to apply them in the woven cloth in a variety of ways. This book discussed recent studies in different branches of textile research.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a303051d36b9e9f2c9b027177dc9a27f618b60ce","amp;dn":"Textiles%3A+Types%2C+Uses+and+Production+Methods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a303051d36b9e9f2c9b027177dc9a27f618b60ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,3,5,29,54,185,233,242,201,176,39,23,125,201,162,127,97,139,96,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
