She turned on the camera, pulled out some bread and cheese, and then, as one does, started drinking. (Doesn't everyone cook with a spoon in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other?) The video went viral and an online sensation was born.\n\nMy Drunk Kitchen includes recipes, stories, full color photos, and drawings to inspire your own culinary adventures in tipsy cooking. It is also a showcase for Hannah Hart's great comedic voice. Hannah offers key drink recommendations, cooking tips (like, remember to turn the oven off when you go to bed) and shares never-before-seen recipes such as:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tThe Hartwich (Knowledge is ingenuity! Learn from the past!)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCan Bake (Inventing things is hard! You don't have to start from scratch!)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tLatke Shotkas (Plan ahead to avoid a night of dread!)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tTiny Sandwiches (Size doesn't matter! Aim to satisfy.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tSaltine Nachos (It's not about resources! It's about being resourceful.)\nThis is a book for anyone who believes they have what it takes to make a soufflÃƒÂ© for the holiday party and show up the person who apparently has nothing better to do than bake things from scratch. It also recommends the drink you'll need to accompany any endeavor of this magnitude. In the end, My Drunk Kitchen may not be your go-to guide for your next dinner party . . . but it will make you laugh and drink . . . I mean think . . . about life.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cvxOJIV.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cvxOJIV.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d690dd1c450bdabf99fbb76e1ab795e7f1f41ba8","amp;dn":"My+Drunk+Kitchen%3A+A+Guide+to+Eating%2C+Drinking%2C+and+Going+with+Yo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d690dd1c450bdabf99fbb76e1ab795e7f1f41ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,144,221,28,69,11,218,191,153,251,183,110,26,183,149,231,241,244,27,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
