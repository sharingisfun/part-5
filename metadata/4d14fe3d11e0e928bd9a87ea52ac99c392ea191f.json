And it will take all of their courage and will for their love to survive beyond time itself...\n\n\nTALL, DARK AND KILTED Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Book 3\n\nCilla Swanner came to Dunroamin Castle in Scotland to get away from heartache and headache. But what she finds there may be more than she can handle. Long ago, the roguish Scottish knight known as Hardwick was cursed to wander the world forever, pleasing a different woman each night with no hope of fulfillment or true love. Then he meets CillaÃ‚â€”who may be his only hope for salvation.\n\n\nMUST LOVE KILTS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Book 5\n\nMargo Menlove loves everything Scottish-especially the legendary warrior hero Magnus MacBride. But while exploring in the Highlands she picks up a magical stone on the shore, and awakens to the sight of MacBride himself. And the reality may be much more dangerous-and passionate-than her dreams could ever be.\n\n\nHAUNTED WARRIOR Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Book 6\n\nKendra Chase is exhausted from her work as a ghost whisperer, so she's been looking forward to her vacation in Edinburgh. But work awaits her as the tiny fishing village is being excavated, and supernatural uprisings have been reported.\n\nGraeme MacGrath knows the source of the psychic trouble. The excavation is disrupting the protective veil between this world and darker, more ancient ones. He hates to admit it but he will need the fetching Kendra and her paranormal abilities to save the town he loves from unspeakable evil.\n\n\nNotes:\nHave tested all eight of the ebook files.
