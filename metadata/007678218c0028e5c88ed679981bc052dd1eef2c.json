More than a dozen projects, many with variations, are explained in detailed, step-by-step instructions accompanied by hundreds of full-color photographs to ensure that you learn and understand every skill needed to create these one-of-a-kind, wearable works of art. You'll discover the basic jewelry making tools you need--including pliers, sanding pads, and tin snips, for example--and how to improvise with what you already have on hand in your home--wooden dowels, screwdrivers, wire, and more. Using inexpensive and simple but beautiful materials, you'll learn how to transform wire, copper, and beads into an art deco inspired necklace, manipulate metals and wire to form a dramatic cuff bracelet, create classic wrapped loop earrings, and much more. You can work your way through the book from start to finish as the projects move from the very simple to the more elaborate, or you can enhance and build on the skills you already have with new techniques and designs that will inspire your creativity. Throughout the book you'll find expert tips and techniques to experiment with and incorporate into your own designs. &quot;Picture Yourself Making Jewelry and Beading&quot; offers the practical instruction and creative encouragement you need to take your jewelry design ideas from concept to completion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:007678218c0028e5c88ed679981bc052dd1eef2c","amp;dn":"Picture+Yourself+Making+Jewelry+and+Beading+%282007%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"007678218c0028e5c88ed679981bc052dd1eef2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,118,120,33,140,0,40,229,200,142,214,121,152,27,192,82,221,30,239,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
