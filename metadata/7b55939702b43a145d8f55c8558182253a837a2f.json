And      \n    Poirot, of course. Before they've even downed the first  \n    Martini, one of them is dead. Not Poirot, of course.     \n    Cartwright, having successfully played a detective on    \n    the London stage, is determined to play detective in     \n    real life and he doesn't do badly, finding all sorts of  \n    clues and leads. However - unlike in the original novel  \n    Three Act Tragedy - he deigns graciously to let Poirot   \n    help him after a second inexplicable death takes place.  \n    This Christie whodunnit is so sumptuously staged, so     \n    artfully theatrical and has such a handsome cast, you    \n    can easily forgive it being laughably easy to work out   \n    who the murderer is.                                     \n      \n\n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n      The PDTV caps from 2006 named s12, are in fact the 4     \n                     episodes of season 10.                   \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     you viewing pleasure!                  \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b55939702b43a145d8f55c8558182253a837a2f","amp;dn":"Agatha.Christie.Poirot.S12E01.HDTV.XviD-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b55939702b43a145d8f55c8558182253a837a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,85,147,151,2,180,58,20,93,143,85,200,85,129,130,37,58,131,122,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
