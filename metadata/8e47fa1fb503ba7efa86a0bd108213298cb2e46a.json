It has one of the most distinct sounds, rhythms and feels of any genre. In this EZmix pack, Toontrack teamed up with SwedenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier reggae studio of the past three decades, Rub-a-Dub Studios, to dig deeper into the art of roots and reggae production. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½We did something unique this timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, says Ulf Edlund, ToontrackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound designer. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½We brought a digital rig and ran it alongside the analog setup at the studio. We then A/B tested and matched all tones and settings against that.\n\nWe were really blown away by how the emulations in the back end of EZmix 2 performedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, he says. The end result is an impressive collection of tape saturated, tube-sizzling and warm settings for a wide range of instruments and mix scenarios. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only cover the essential guitar and bass tones, but comes with complete effect chains for drums, piano, organ, percussion, horns and vocals. On top of that, it has the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characteristic aux bus effect presets with phasers, delays, plate and spring reverbs. And of course, the eternal, dwindling self feeding dub-delays. This pack paints a comprehensive picture of the distinct sonic landscape that is at the heart and soul of reggae. All that it leaves up to you is to voice your own expression and be creative.\n\n\nSystem requirements:\nWindows:\n\nWindows XP SP3 or newer, Pentium 4 or Athlon processor with 512 MB RAM\n\nMac:\nMac OS X 10.5 or higher, G5 with 512 MB RAM (Intel-based Mac recommended)\n\n40 MB of free hard disc space.
