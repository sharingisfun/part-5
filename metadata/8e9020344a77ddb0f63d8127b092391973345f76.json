Because I began to think back to all of the girls throughout my life that I completely messed up with, simply because I handled them the exact WRONG way.  As Vin teaches the dynamics of how to deal with different ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtypesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of girls, it became clear where I messed up with specific girls.  And how I could have easily gotten them if I had just tweaked a bit to their particular ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtype.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nNow I first heard of the program when I took the Personality Quiz. As Vin builds his case for these personality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“typesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to quickly realize just how accurate his assumptions are.  And if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had any girls in the past that you just couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t figure out what went wrongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ this will probably clear it up for you.\n\nBut, more importantly, it will help make sure you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make the same mistake again.   Damn though, if going through this program didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make me wish I had one of those Uncle Rico time machines to travel back a few yearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nPandoraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Box is sort of fascinatingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and is one of those programs that is going to take control of your mind for a few weeks while youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re learning it.  YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find yourself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtype castingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ all the girls you meet, and slyly strategizing your game plan.  Just give his one minute mind reading a shot.  YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll quickly see how effective this stuff is.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll admit.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s damn fun.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve gone out and put this stuff into use (the whole point right) and have seen some incredible results from it.  LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just say my cold reading skills have gone through the roof.\n\nBut what its even better for, is learning how to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œplayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a girl.  I think one of the biggest problems is keeping a womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interest after the initial meetingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦  PandoraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Box system helps you strategize the entire seduction down to the tee.\n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s is some of the things youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to learn:\n\n1.   The 8 Personality types based on his research (YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll quickly be able to place pretty much any girl you know into one of these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtypesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n2.  How these different ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtypesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are likely to act in different situations.\n\n3.  The different ways you need to proceed when dealing with these different types.  He covers:\n\na)      How to approach the different types\n\nb)      The types of flirting that each type responds best to\n\nc)       How to escalate with each type (this was really informative cuz girls respond SO differently to escalation.\n\nd)      How to create a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdeeperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ connection with each type\n\ne)      How to read her body language (again very interesting and really helps you judge her interest level)\n\nf)       What type of sex she responds best to  (this was probably the most shocking, because its completely different then you might have expected.\n\nThere is so much more to PandoraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Box than I can cover in this short review.  And to be honest, I am going through it several more times, and picking up the little details and tricks to figuring women out.\n\nIF you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t already own PandoraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Box system, I would get a copy of the program.
