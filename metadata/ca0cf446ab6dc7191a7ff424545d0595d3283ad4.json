HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hoping no one misses the irony of the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title, because Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening stacks the rape jokes high, but AzizÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s act is, fortunately, much more than filthy. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHarassing Harris on FacebookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be nearly as funny if it werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t for the man's keen ability to put the listener in a paranoid preteen mindset while the insults thrown at MTV are razor-sharp, skewering the contestants of Aziz's most hated show, Next. Hipsters, social network addicts, and those who practice shroomery will get the most out of the manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thoroughly modern set, but you only need a passing knowledge of Kanye West and R. Kelly to belly laugh at the outstanding fourth quarter. Anyone who appreciates observational humor at breakneck speed must hear the comedianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s re-creation of an R. Kelly club appearance, and if that werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t enough, AzizÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s over the top ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRAAAAAAAANDYÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ character from the film Funny People provides the encore, which brings down the house. Providing every reason why Kanye West and Judd Apatow are both big fans, this is a fantastic, uproarious debut. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wifwxz9sldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wifwxz9sldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAziz Ansari - 01 - Gay Rights\nAziz Ansari - 02 - Sheets\nAziz Ansari - 03 - CVS\nAziz Ansari - 04 - Getting The Sniffles On A Flight\nAziz Ansari - 05 - Craigslist\nAziz Ansari - 06 - My Random Roommate\nAziz Ansari - 07 - Getting Recognized In New York\nAziz Ansari - 08 - Walking With Dinosaurs\nAziz Ansari - 09 - Simple Man Cruise\nAziz Ansari - 10 - My Cousin Harris\nAziz Ansari - 11 - Harassing Harris On Facebook\nAziz Ansari - 12 - Are White People Psyched All The Time\nAziz Ansari - 13 - MTV's Next\nAziz Ansari - 14 - The J-1 Waiver\nAziz Ansari - 15 - Using My BlackBerry While Driving\nAziz Ansari - 16 - Bonnaroo\nAziz Ansari - 17 - Cold Stone Creamery\nAziz Ansari - 18 - Something Cool To Say To M.I.A\nAziz Ansari - 19 - A Night Out With Kanye West\nAziz Ansari - 20 - Kanye West vs. Darwish\nAziz Ansari - 21 - R.
