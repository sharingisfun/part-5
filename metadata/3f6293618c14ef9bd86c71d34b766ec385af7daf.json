With this book, you will learn how to create a unique creature from start to finish and search for and repair any foreseeable problems. Clear instructions guide you through using Photoshop in combination with ZBrush to finely render a creature so you can see how it will appear on screen. Experienced ZBrush author and designer Scott Spencer shows you how to start with your concept in ZBrush as a preliminary digital model and then further refine it in Photoshop in order to fabricate a hyperrealistic image.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f6293618c14ef9bd86c71d34b766ec385af7daf","amp;dn":"ZBrush+Creature+Design+%28Sybex%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f6293618c14ef9bd86c71d34b766ec385af7daf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,98,147,97,140,20,239,155,216,108,113,211,75,118,110,195,133,175,125,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
