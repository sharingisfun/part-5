The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two previous albums, The Foundation and You\nGet What You Give, have gone platinum and produced nine consecutive No. 1 songs.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is the first record weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made from start to finish in one thought,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said\nmulti-instrumentalist Clay Cook. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The previous albums have been a collection of\nsongs ... this is an album.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a792db1666902a386bfd2756a88e8cd847ce6068","amp;dn":"Zac_Brown_Band-Uncaged-2012-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a792db1666902a386bfd2756a88e8cd847ce6068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,146,219,22,102,144,42,56,107,253,39,86,168,142,140,216,71,206,96,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
