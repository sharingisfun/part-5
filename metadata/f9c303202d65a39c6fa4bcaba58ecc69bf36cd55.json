Motown's first successful female vocal group, the Marvelettes are most notable for recording the company's first #1 Pop hit, &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;, and for setting the precedent for later Motown girl groups such as Martha and the Vandellas and The Supremes.\nDuring their eight-year run on the Billboard music charts, the group scored nineteen top forty American R&amp;B Singles and ten Top 40 American Pop singles. Of these hits, three were Top 10 Pop singles, nine were top Top 10 R&amp;B singles, and their debut was #1 one on both charts. (Between 1961 and 1969 they charted a total of 25 Pop singles.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9c303202d65a39c6fa4bcaba58ecc69bf36cd55","amp;dn":"The+Marvelettes-6+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9c303202d65a39c6fa4bcaba58ecc69bf36cd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,195,3,32,45,101,163,156,111,164,188,171,165,142,204,105,191,54,205,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
