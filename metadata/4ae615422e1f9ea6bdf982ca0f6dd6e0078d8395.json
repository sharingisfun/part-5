But if you've ever wondered how type was developed, exactly what a Goudy Friar is, or if Baskerville has anything to do with Sherlock Holmes, then Type will answer these questions and more. This is the story of the faces behind type, letters and typography: it tells of the passions and obsessions of its creators, of war, persecution and political upheaval, of business and technological breakthrough, of rivalry, death and disinterment. With the skill of a novelist, Simon Loxley weaves the story of letters through the history of our time. From Gutenberg's first moveable type to the internet, type has grown out of ambition, jealousy, desire, treachery and love. Never again will you look at your letters, your bank statements or your books in the same way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae615422e1f9ea6bdf982ca0f6dd6e0078d8395","amp;dn":"Type+-+The+Secret+History+of+Letters+%28Design+Art+Printing+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae615422e1f9ea6bdf982ca0f6dd6e0078d8395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,230,21,66,46,31,158,166,189,249,130,202,15,109,214,224,7,141,131,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
