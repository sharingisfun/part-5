Usually Satan will travel to the human world to display the more contemptible sides of human nature such as snipers shooting old ladies in Bosnia or prostitution in Thailand to a generally horrified Professor. However, the Professor's idealism is usually shown to have some validity as well and more often than not the Professor wins the argument, although Satan always insists he hasn't.\n\n\nCast:\nAndy Hamilton\nJames Grout \nJimmy Mulville\nSteve O'Donnell \nRobert Duncan\nAnnette Crosbie\nGeoffrey Whitehead\nClaire Skinner\nMichael Fenton Stevens. \n\n\nOld Harry's Game - S01 - E01 - Welcome To Hell\nOld Harry's Game - S01 - E02 - Corruption\nOld Harry's Game - S01 - E03 - Hero Worship\nOld Harry's Game - S01 - E04 - Appearances\nOld Harry's Game - S01 - E05 - Rebellion\nOld Harry's Game - S01 - E06 - Redempton\n\nOld Harry's Game - S02 - E01 - Assistant\nOld Harry's Game - S02 - E02 - Chuckles\nOld Harry's Game - S02 - E03 - Nero\nOld Harry's Game - S02 - E04 - Computers\nOld Harry's Game - S02 - E05 - G.U.T. \nOld Harry's Game - S02 - E06 - Too Far \n\nOld Harry's Game - S03 - E01 - This Thing Called Love\nOld Harry's Game - S03 - E02 - Another Country\nOld Harry's Game - S03 - E03 - A Four-Letter Word\nOld Harry's Game - S03 - E04 - The Reasonably Fantastic Journey\nOld Harry's Game - S03 - E05 - The Beautiful Game\nOld Harry's Game - S03 - E06 - The Final Reckoning\n\nOld Harry's Game - S04 - E01 - Knowledge And Ignorance \nOld Harry's Game - S04 - E02 - Beautiful England\nOld Harry's Game - S04 - E03 - Health And Safety \nOld Harry's Game - S04 - E04 - Poets Corner \nOld Harry's Game - S04 - E05 - Sleep \nOld Harry's Game - S04 - E06 - Beauty \nOld Harry's Game - S04 - E07 - The Roll Of The Dice \nOld Harry's Game - S04 - E08 - Knocking On Heaven's Door \n\nOld Harry's Game - S05 - E01 - Improvement\nOld Harry's Game - S05 - E02 - Religions\nOld Harry's Game - S05 - E03 - Government\nOld Harry's Game - S05 - E04 - Media\n\nOld Harry's Game - S06 - E01 - Edith\nOld Harry's Game - S06 - E02 - Discoveries\nOld Harry's Game - S06 - E03 - Murderers\nOld Harry's Game - S06 - E04 - Psychiatry\nOld Harry's Game - S06 - E05 - Investigation\nOld Harry's Game - S06 - E06 - Ginger\n\nOld Harry's Game - S07 - E01 - Scamp\nOld Harry's Game - S07 - E02 - Satan\nOld Harry's Game - S07 - E03 - Papoose\nOld Harry's Game - S07 - E04 - Persuaded\nOld Harry's Game - S07 - E05 - Adoption\nOld Harry's Game - S07 - E06 - Return\nOld Harry's Game - S07 - E07 - Christmas Spirit\nOld Harry's Game - S07 - E08 - Ring In The New\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167933c370bb43825ea1fd860c080a7ab88c0b2b","amp;dn":"Old+Harry%5C%27s+Game+-+S01+to+07+-+Audio+-+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167933c370bb43825ea1fd860c080a7ab88c0b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,121,51,195,112,187,67,130,94,161,253,134,12,8,10,122,184,140,11,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
