Filmed from 1968 to 1971, the first part was released during 1970 for the 25th anniversary of Victory Day. The series was a Soviet-Polish-East German-Italian-Yugoslavian co-production (by the studios Mosfilm, ZF-Start/PRF-ZF, Deutsche Film AG, Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica and Avala Film, respectively). It was directed by Yuri Ozerov. The script was written by Yuri Bondarev and Oscar Kurganov.\n\nThe films are a dramatized account of the liberation of the Soviet Union's territory and the subsequent defeat of Nazi Germany in the Great Patriotic War, focusing on five major Eastern Front campaigns: the Battle of Kursk, the Lower Dnieper Offensive, Operation Bagration, the Vistula-Oder Offensive and the Battle of Berlin.\n\nFive episodes (6 parts), with a technical specification of:\n\nFormat: AVI\nFormat profile: OpenDML\nTotal File size: 6.87 GiB\nDuration: 7h 25mn\n\n\nVideo Codec: DivX 5\nBit rate: 1 751 Kbps\nWidth: 720 pixels\nHeight: 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 2.35:1\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\n\nAudio Codec: AC-3\nBit rate: 448 Kbps\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151852/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151852/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRussian, German, English, Serbian, French, Italian, Polish audio (with Russian voice-over)\n\nEnglish, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted  at bt.eutorrents.com originally by AlexPogodin, whom we thank.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b45076ad1911bbcec53b7756fdc841c5cf86156","amp;dn":"Osvobozhdenie+%5BLiberation%5D+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b45076ad1911bbcec53b7756fdc841c5cf86156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,69,7,106,209,145,27,188,236,83,183,117,111,220,132,28,92,248,97,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
