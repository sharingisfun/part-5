We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his father and his basket-case friends. A lot of crazy stuff happens, for example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0262c672dffab76ecc9110ac18fad61524ebee2","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Be+a+Menace+to+South+Central+%5B1996%5D+DVDrip-LiTTLe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0262c672dffab76ecc9110ac18fad61524ebee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,38,44,103,45,255,171,118,236,201,17,10,193,143,173,97,82,78,190,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
