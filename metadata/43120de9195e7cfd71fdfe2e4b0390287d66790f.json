The immense map offered players a scope and depth never before seen in games. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City took a trip back in time and revisited the 1980s, complete with the era's unique fashion and classic pop music. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City follows Tommy Vercetti, as he attempts to navigate the city's tropical environment rife with gangsters and other seedy citizens. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas introduced San Andreas, the largest map of the series, which boasts three enormous cities. The narrative explores the life of Carl Johnson as he returns home to San Andreas after learning of the mysterious events surrounding a death in the family.\n\nAll three games feature thrilling, deep narratives, acerbic and witty dialogue, a cast of superbly voiced characters, a fleet of vehicles, and hours of music through in-game radio stations ranging from reggae, 80s pop, disco and hip-hop. \n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories is the second game developed by Rockstar Games initially specifically for the PlayStation Portable, but later converted it to the platform PlayStation 2 In preparing the predecessor of this item, or Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, developers have gained a lot of experience, and therefore their new pocket seems to work much better than the first.\n\n[INSTALL]\nTo unpack , use the 7 -Zip or WinRAR\nBurn with Nero or UltraISO.\nBurn to disc DVD-5 or 4x Speed\nEnjoy!
