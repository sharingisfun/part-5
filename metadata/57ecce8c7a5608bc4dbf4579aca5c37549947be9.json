Their country rock sound was influential on many bands who played the Twin Cities circuit during the 1980s and 1990s like Uncle Tupelo, The Gear Daddies and The Honeydogs. They have released several studio albums, including five on the American Recordings label. On hiatus from 2005 to 2009, the band has since reunited and released a new album, &quot;Mockingbird Time,&quot; in September 2011. \n\n\nEnjoy The Jayhawks :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57ecce8c7a5608bc4dbf4579aca5c37549947be9","amp;dn":"The+Jayhawks+-+7+Albums+1986+-+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57ecce8c7a5608bc4dbf4579aca5c37549947be9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,236,206,140,122,86,8,188,77,191,69,121,172,165,195,117,73,148,123,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
