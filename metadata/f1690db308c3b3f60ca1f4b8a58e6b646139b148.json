Multicultural in more forms than anticipated, \r\nare the leading and upwardly mobile alien race who have gelled themselves \r\ninto the Human psyche and exploited it to its full potential. This is the \r\nstory of an every man, a no one, a Nada who stumbles upon their secret, via \r\nan underground movement, whose mission is to sabotage their plans and awaken \r\nthe world to its sinister plans. With the help of a pair of sunglasses, that \r\nshows the world as it really is, not in colour, but a black and white parallel \r\nworld that the sub-conscious has chosen to ignore. With subliminal messages \r\nas &quot;OBEY&quot;, &quot;CONFORM&quot;, &quot;MARRY AND REPRODUCE&quot;, &quot;CONSUME&quot;, &quot;WATCH TELEVISION&quot; \r\nand &quot;SLEEP&quot;. It is through this thought control that the aliens have this \r\nworld tied up and neatly packaged for its own manipulative uses, to further \r\nthemselves at the expense of the meek, mild and the lowly sufferers of a job \r\nless and hungry world. This is the battle of self-awareness and one man's \r\nstruggle with a reality check that has these alien beings staging war against \r\nthe up-rising and rebellious armies from the gutters and streets. They Live \r\nYou Sleep; where will your consciousness take you when the sleep is washed \r\nfrom your eyes. Welcome to the real world.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Roddy Piper R.I.P.\r\n=&gt;-Keith David.\r\n=&gt;-Meg Foster.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-John Carpenter.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Horror : Cult Classic : Sci-Fi : Comedy.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1988.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.93 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 944 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 34mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters...................: 8 Named.\r\n=&gt;-They Live 1988.............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/they_live\r\n=&gt;-They Live 1988.............: http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/they-live\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1080 x 816.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2 666 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 160 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 319 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English Commentary.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 222 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1690db308c3b3f60ca1f4b8a58e6b646139b148","amp;dn":"They+Live+-+Roddy+Piper+Sci-Fi+Collectors+Edition+1988+Eng+Subs+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1690db308c3b3f60ca1f4b8a58e6b646139b148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,105,13,179,8,195,179,246,12,161,244,184,165,142,107,100,97,57,177,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
