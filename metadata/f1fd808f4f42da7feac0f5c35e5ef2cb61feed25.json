After learning it, if you are think that you can sit back and relax, you cannot be further away from truth. To beat the crowd, you need to be better than others, learn tips and tricks that other donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know yet. This book is a compilation of the best practices of programming with Visual Studio.\n\nVisual Studio 2010 best practices will take you through the practices that you need to master programming with .NET Framework. The book goes on to detail several practices involving many aspects of software development with Visual Studio. These practices include debugging and exception handling and design. It details building and maintaining a recommended practices library and the criteria by which to document recommended practices.\n\nThe book begins with practices on source code control (SCC). It includes different types of SCC and discusses how to choose them based on different scenarios. Advanced syntax in C# is then covered with practices covering generics, iterator methods, lambdas, and closures.\n\nThe next set of practices focus on deployment as well as creating MSI deployments with Windows Installer XML (WiX)Ã¢â‚¬â€including Windows applications and services. The book then takes you through practices for developing with WCF and Web Service.\n\nThe software development lifecycle is completed with practices on testing like project structure, naming, and the different types of automated tests. Topics like test coverage, continuous testing and deployment, and mocking are included. Although this book uses Visual Studio as example, you can use these practices with any IDE.\n\nWhat you will learn from this book\n\n- Learning source code control\n- Practices for advanced C# syntax\n- Asynchronous programming in C#\n- Learn tips for architecting decoupled systems\n- Practices for designing multi-threaded and parallel systems\n- Practices for designing distributed systems\n- Learn better ways of developing web services with WCF\n- Learn faster ways to design automated tests\n- Tips and tricks to test complex systems\n- Understanding proven ways of deploying software systems in Windows\n\nApproach\nIt will be a step-by-step tutorial that will discuss best practices. The book is structured in such a way that it can be read both from start to end or can dipped into.\n\nWho this book is written for\n.Net developers using Visual Studio for programming will find this book useful. If you are developing your application with C#, you will find better ways to do things with Visual Studio.\n\nYou should know basics of development with .Net Framework and need working knowledge on VIsual Studio\nBook Details\n\nPaperback: 280 pages\nPublisher: Packt Publishing (August 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1849687161\nISBN-13: 978-1849687164","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fd808f4f42da7feac0f5c35e5ef2cb61feed25","amp;dn":"Visual+Studio+2010+Best+Practices+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fd808f4f42da7feac0f5c35e5ef2cb61feed25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,253,128,143,79,66,218,127,234,192,245,195,94,94,242,203,97,254,237,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
