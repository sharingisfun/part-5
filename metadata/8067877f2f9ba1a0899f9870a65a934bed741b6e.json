Inside the torrent there is an ISO with slip streamed AHCI drivers for Intel-based chipsets, and a zip file that contains: Service Pack 2, Windows Update installer, Registry update hack, and DOT.NET installer. This version of Windows is not modified at all other than that it has the AHCI drivers slip streamed. For those of you who do not know, modern day chipsets prefer AHCI for handling SATA devices and Windows XP doesn't have built in drivers for AHCI. Therefore, unless you can change the options in your bios, the installer will blue screen before you get a chance to load your hard drive. After figuring this all out myself, I thought that it should be available to other people. So here it is.
