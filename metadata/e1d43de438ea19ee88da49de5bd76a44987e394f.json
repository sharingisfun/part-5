Ozzy Osbourne has called Disturbed the &quot;future of metal,&quot; and he might be right; they have almost single-handedly plucked the genre out of the aggro dung heap and fueled it with intelligence. \n\nThe band is just as aggressive here as on their debut, but they've lost some of their dark angst, and as a result have created a melodic, psychically lighter album, despite the fact that the CD kicks off with &quot;Prayer,&quot; a conversation between Draiman and God, inspired by the singer's grandfather's death.\n\nLinage: CD &gt; EAC &gt; flac &gt; dbPoweramp &gt; MP3\n\nTags: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\nIncludes: NFO, PLS, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers: Front \n\n\nSonglist\n\n01.
