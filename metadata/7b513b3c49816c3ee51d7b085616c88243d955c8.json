Key concepts are introduced in an incremental fashion to provide a thorough overview of the field.\nClosely tailored to the undergraduate immunology curriculum, Part 1 outlines basic immunology, while Part 2 covers more disease-related and clinical aspects. The new edition of this popular title features a fully updated overview of the roles and regulation of the cells and molecules of the immune system. Key point summaries have been expanded, and key objectives added to the start of each chapter, to help the reader focus on the essential Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtake-homeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ messages. Readers can then test themselves using the brand new self-assessment section containing problem-solving questions and extended matching questions (EMQs).\n\nIncluding simple, memorable illustrations and quick reference tables, Lecture Notes: Immunology provides the perfect distillation of information for easy recall at revision time, and is ideal for both the novice and those with some prior knowledge of the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b513b3c49816c3ee51d7b085616c88243d955c8","amp;dn":"Lecture+Notes+Immunology%2C+6E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b513b3c49816c3ee51d7b085616c88243d955c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,81,59,60,73,129,108,62,229,29,123,8,86,22,200,130,67,217,85,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
