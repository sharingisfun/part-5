It treats the subject as a coherent whole, complete with numerous logical connections, consequences, and an underlying structure and &quot;language.&quot; Employing an approach based on mechanism and reaction type, the book empasizes understanding ideas rather than merely memorizing facts. It shows students how to realistically draw molecules and mechanisms to reveal the fundamental chemistry.Using a fresh, accessible writing style as well as examples from everyday life, the authors explain the basics of organic chemistry carefully and thoroughly. A special focus on mechanism, orbitals, and stereochemistry helps students gain a solid comprehension of important factors common to all reactions. The book's innovative design enhances clarity and instruction with boxes that separate summary information and other material from the main text; a variety of colors that draw attention to items such as atoms, molecules, and orbitals; and figures that are drawn in red with significant parts emphasized in black. Early chapters feature carbonyl group reactions, and later chapters systematically develop the chemistry through discussions of spectroscopy, stereochemistry, and chemical reactions.Each chapter opens with a &quot;Connections&quot; box, divided into three columns:Ã‚Â· Building on: Details material from previous chapters that relate to the current chapterÃ‚Â· Arriving at: Provides a guide to the content of the chapterÃ‚Â· Looking forward to: Previews later chapters, which develop and expand the current material  \n\nYear: 2000\nEdition: 1\nLanguage: English\nPages: 1536\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-Jonathan-Clayden/dp/0199270295/ref=pd_sim_b_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-Jonathan-Clayden/dp/0199270295/ref=pd_sim_b_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSolutions Manual to Accompany Organic Chemistry [Paperback]\nStuart Warren\n\nPaperback: 512 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA; Sol edition (October 4, 2001)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0198700385\nISBN-13: 978-0198700388\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Solutions-Manual-Accompany-Organic-Chemistry/dp/0198700385/ref=pd_sim_b_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Solutions-Manual-Accompany-Organic-Chemistry/dp/0198700385/ref=pd_sim_b_1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:665e38a92437f6a36a93b324810d4a0ac59585c0","amp;dn":"+Organic+Chemistry+%2BSolutions+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"665e38a92437f6a36a93b324810d4a0ac59585c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,94,56,169,36,55,246,163,106,147,179,36,129,13,74,10,197,149,133,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
