First, a little background on the film from Wade Sampson:\n\nIn 1997, musical performer and composer Sting was asked by the Walt Disney Company to write the music for a new animated feature called Kingdom of the Sun. It was to be directed by Roger Allers who was basking in the success of his work on The Lion King. Sting agreed, on the condition that his wife, filmmaker Trudie Styler, could document the process of the production with their own production company, Xingu FilmsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦StingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife was given unlimited access when it came to Production No. 1331 (aka Ã¢â‚¬Å“KingdomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). She and her camera sat in on story meetings for the movie, rolled while actors auditioned as well as taping Sting while he recorded the score. No one expected two years into the production, it would shift direction drastically.\n\nThe Sweatbox is at turns infuriating, hilarious and enlightening. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll cringe in sympathy with the Disney artists as you see the gross bureaucratic incompetence they had to endure while working at the studio in the 1990s. The film not only captures the tortured morphing of the Kingdom of the Sun into The EmperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New Groove, it also serves as an invaluable historical document about DisneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s animation operations in the late-1990s. If any questions remain about why Disney fizzled out creatively and surrendered its feature animation crown to Pixar and DreamWorks, this film will answer them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:574c0e322bdd306dc4485a2b9c4cecc4bcc2a0d4","amp;dn":"The+Sweatbox+Disney+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"574c0e322bdd306dc4485a2b9c4cecc4bcc2a0d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,76,14,50,43,221,48,109,196,72,90,43,156,76,236,196,188,194,160,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
