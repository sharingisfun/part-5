The game's soundtrack consists of eight vocal rock songs and seven instrumental rock and electronic songs, all fast-paced with elements of grunge, hip-hop and rap. The vocal songs are also featured in a second, instrumental version. In the &quot;Be the Cop&quot; and &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot; game modes, the instrumental versions replace the vocal ones, which avoids obscuring the police radio messages by the song lyrics. In the PS2 version, there is the option to change whether or not certain songs are played in normal races, hot pursuit races, the game menus, or if they are not to be played at all. The Xbox version also allows for custom soundtracks, something which Hot Pursuit 2's successors lacked.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Bush - The People That We Love (04:02), 9.30 MB\n02.
