In A Game of Thrones, the first book of a projected seven, George R.R. Martin rewards readers with a vividly real world, well-drawn characters, complex but coherent plotting, and beautifully constructed prose, which Locus called &quot;well above the norms of the genre.&quot;\nMartin's Seven Kingdoms resemble England during the Wars of the Roses, with the Stark and Lannister families standing in for the Yorks and Lancasters. The story of these two families and their struggle to control the Iron Throne dominates the foreground; in the background is a huge, ancient wall marking the northern border, beyond which barbarians, ice vampires, and direwolves menace the south as years-long winter advances. Abroad, a dragon princess lives among horse nomads and dreams of fiery reconquest.\n\nThere is much bloodshed, cruelty, and death, but A Game of Thrones is nevertheless compelling; it garnered a Nebula nomination and won the 1996 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.\n\nChaptered.\nUnabridged.\nRead By: Roy Dotrice\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nVisit us for this and loads more more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n\n-------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd1608a09720ceb3cc8ab1c4a2cc3f943f893f4f","amp;dn":"A+Game+of+Thrones+%5BChaptered%5D%5BUnb%5D+-++George+R.R.+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd1608a09720ceb3cc8ab1c4a2cc3f943f893f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,22,8,160,151,32,206,179,204,138,177,196,162,204,63,148,63,137,63,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
