It has been over a year, and since then, season 2 has aired. So, I put season 1 together with the new season, grabbed some extras, and combined it. The old torrent has been deleted to make room for this new one. Enjoy!]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Three.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb9113b6d288b35f4156c3f5fd491bdbcd3754cd","amp;dn":"Human+Giant+-+Seasons+1-2+%2B+Extras+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb9113b6d288b35f4156c3f5fd491bdbcd3754cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,145,19,182,210,136,179,95,65,86,195,245,253,73,27,219,205,55,84,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
