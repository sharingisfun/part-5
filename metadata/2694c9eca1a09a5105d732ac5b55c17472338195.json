Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and musically influential groups in the history of popular music.\nFounded in 1965, the band originally consisted of students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. They first gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's creative leadership they released two charting singles and a successful debut album. David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967, and Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to his deteriorating mental health. After Barrett's departure, Waters became their primary songwriter and lyricist. With Waters, Mason, Wright and Gilmour, Pink Floyd achieved critical and commercial success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983).\nWright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd and Wright subsequently joined them as a paid musician. They continued to record and tour through 1994; two more albums followed, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994). Inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, as of 2013 they have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million certified units in the United States.\nAfter nearly two decades of acrimony, the band reunited in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. In 2011, surviving members Gilmour and Mason joined Waters at one of his The Wall Tour shows at The O2 Arena in London.\n\nPink Floyd - The Final Cut\n\n\nTracklist:\nSide A\nA1 The Post War Dream\nA2 Your Possible Pasts\nA3 One Of The Few\nA4 The Hero's Return\nA5 The Gunners Dream\nA6 Paranoid Eyes\n\nSide B\nB1 Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\nB2 The Fletcher Memorial Home\nB3 Southampton Dock\nB4 The Final Cut\nB5 Not Now John\nB6 Two Suns In The Sunset\n\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry:UK\nGenre:Rock\nStyles:Progressive rock\n\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : Vinyl\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate : 4971 ~ 4506 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 192 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2694c9eca1a09a5105d732ac5b55c17472338195","amp;dn":"%281983%29+Pink+Floyd+-+The+Final+Cut+%5BVInylRip+24+bits%3A192+KHz+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2694c9eca1a09a5105d732ac5b55c17472338195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,148,201,236,161,160,154,81,5,215,50,172,91,85,193,116,114,51,129,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
