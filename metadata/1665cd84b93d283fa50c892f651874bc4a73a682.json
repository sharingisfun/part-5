This is good news for fans who were unwilling to dip into their savings to pick up Parlophone' s mammoth ten-disc Solo Collection, as it utilizes the majority of that collection's strengths. For the most part, this is all anyone could want from a non-Queen Mercury overview, and despite the inclusion of a few too many posthumous remixes, serves as moving eulogy to one of popular music's most beloved voices.\n\nGenre................: Rock/Vocal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2006\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Log, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.In My Defence (2000 Remix)\n02.The Great Pretender\n03.Living On My Own (1993 Radio Mix)\n04.Made In Heaven\n05.Love Kills\n06.There Must Be More To Life Than This\n07.Guide Me Home\n08.How Can I Go On\n09.Foolin' Around (Steve Brown Remix)\n10.Time\n11.Barcelona\n12.Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow\n13.I Was Born To Love You\n14.The Golden Boy\n15.Mr. Bad Guy\n16.The Great Pretender (Malouf Remix)\n17.Love Kills (Star Rider Remix)\n18.I Can Hear Music\n19.Goin' Back\n20.Guide Me Home (Piano Version) (Bonus Track)\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Love Kills (Sunshine People Radio Mix)\n02.Made In Heaven (Extended Version)\n03.Living On My Own (The Egg Remix)\n04.Love Kills (Rank 1 Remix)\n05.Mr Bad Guy (Bad Circulation Version)\n06.I Was Born To Love You (George Demure Almost Vocal Mix)\n07.My Love Is Dangerous (Extended Version)\n08.Love Makin' Love (Demo)\n09.Love Kills (Pixel82 Remix)\n10.I Was Born To Love You (Extended Version)\n11.Foolin' Around (Early Version)\n12.Living On My Own (No More Brothers Extended Mix)\n13.Love Kills (More Oder Rework By The Glimmers)\n14.Your Kind Of Lover (Vocal &amp; Piano Version)\n15.Let's Turn It On (A Cappella)\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1665cd84b93d283fa50c892f651874bc4a73a682","amp;dn":"Freddie+Mercury+-+Very+Best+Of+Solo+2006+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1665cd84b93d283fa50c892f651874bc4a73a682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,101,205,132,185,61,40,63,165,12,137,47,101,24,116,188,74,115,166,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
