I'm not especially a fan of animated movies, and have only seen a small handful of anime productions. So it came as a very unexpected surprise to discover that I absolutely loved this movie. It just seemed to get everything pretty much right. The visual artistry was quite beautiful, with a great deal of invention in the scenes where the little Borrowers navigate through the wide expanses of the house they live underneath. The music was quite stunningly appropriate, with the lilting Celtic sound just perfect in tone for this melancholic story, with some lovely vocal work too. And these images and sounds were combined together into a simple narrative that had an enormous amount of heart to it. I felt a warm buzz long after leaving the theatre.\n\nThe Borrower Arrietty is a beautiful film. I cannot really find fault with it. So from this reviewer who has very limited knowledge of anime I give it a perfect ten.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d3a9b4047dd7b625e2a50f7fbc113e76fed260","amp;dn":"The+Secret+World+of+Arrietty+%5BEnglish%5D++DVDRip+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d3a9b4047dd7b625e2a50f7fbc113e76fed260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,211,169,180,4,125,215,182,37,226,165,15,127,188,17,62,118,254,210,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
