Punk? Americana? How about just a damn good time! The Goddamn Gallows are hands down one of the hardest working bands in America. They have taken their blend of Rock'n'Roll from coast to coast numerous times and have built themselves a very dedicated following. With this their latest, that following should grow along with picking up new fans as well. They have played with everyone from the Koffin Kats to the Nekromantix to the Chop Tops and way too many to mention. A party band and one that you should not ignore!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a01544ee766028ff2d2dcca5e596e3c9409f5f7","amp;dn":"The+Goddamn+Gallows+-+Ghost+Of+The+Rails+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a01544ee766028ff2d2dcca5e596e3c9409f5f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,1,84,78,231,102,2,143,242,210,220,202,94,89,110,60,148,9,245,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
