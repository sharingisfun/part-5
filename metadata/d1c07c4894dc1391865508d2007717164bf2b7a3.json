Todd grew up on a ranch and loves the idea of raising his kids in the same spirit of country living. They're looking for a house with several acres of land, as well as a big kitchen and lots of space to entertain. With a total budget of $359,000, they're hoping that Chip and Joanna can surprise them with an outside-the-box rural renovation. Even so, Todd and Lexia are taken aback when find their first stop is not a home, but a horse barn! The next house they visit is the &quot;Dilapidated Duo.&quot; The house is small and dumpy, and it would require a lot of extra additions to create the space their family is hoping for. &quot;The Ranch House&quot; is the last house the Meeks visit on their real estate tour. To their relief, this last option actually looks like a real house!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 12-Jan-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1c07c4894dc1391865508d2007717164bf2b7a3","amp;dn":"Fixer.Upper.S03E07.A.Home.for.Country.Living.PDTV.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1c07c4894dc1391865508d2007717164bf2b7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,192,124,72,148,220,19,145,134,85,8,210,0,119,23,22,75,242,183,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
