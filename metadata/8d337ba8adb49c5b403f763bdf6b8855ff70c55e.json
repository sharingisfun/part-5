While there's no denying his exceptional talent on the six-string, his knack for penning arena rock anthems, or his standing as one of rock's top live acts, it's his non-musical endeavors that have caused the most condemnation from his detractors (his pro-right wing beliefs, pro-gun advocacy, appreciation of hunting animals, etc.). But by the same token, Nugent is a family man and one of the few hard rockers who has admirably stuck by his lifelong anti-drugs and -drink stance throughout his career.\n\nBorn on December 13, 1948, in Detroit, MI, Nugent became interested in rock &amp; roll early in the game, picking up the guitar as a youngster, while his disciplinarian father passed his beliefs down to Nugent. In the '60s, Nugent formed his first bands (including Royal High Boys and Lourdes), drawing inspiration from such British blues-rockers as the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. But it wasn't until the formation of the Amboy Dukes that the Nuge got his first taste of stardom (it was also around this time that Nugent began playing a Gibson Byrdland guitar, a model which would be instantly associated with him throughout his career). The other members of the group didn't exactly share Nugent's clean-living lifestyle, as proven by their psychedelic hit single &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind,&quot; which Nugent claimed he didn't know at the time was about being &quot;under the influence.&quot; The band managed to issue several albums throughout the late '60s -- 1967's self-titled debut, 1968's Journey to the Center of the Mind, and 1969's Migration -- as the group fit in well with such other high-energy rock bands to emerge from the Motor City: MC5 and the Stooges in particular.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Cat Scratch Fever\n02.Just What The Doctor Ordered\n03.Free-For-All\n04.Dog Eat Dog\n05.Motor City Madhouse\n06.Paralyzed\n07.Stranglehold\n08.Baby Please Don't Go (Live)\n09.Wango Tango\n10.Wang Dang Sweet Poontang (Live)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d337ba8adb49c5b403f763bdf6b8855ff70c55e","amp;dn":"Ted+Nugent+-+Great+Gonzos%21+The+Best+Of+%281981%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d337ba8adb49c5b403f763bdf6b8855ff70c55e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,51,123,168,173,180,156,91,64,63,118,59,223,107,136,85,255,112,197,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
