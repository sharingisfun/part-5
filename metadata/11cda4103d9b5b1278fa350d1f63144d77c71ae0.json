There is no       ||\n|| secret there. We are also bummed that there isn't a PC     ||\n|| version of the game. This is why we stepped up and made    ||\n|| one that works with the XBOX RockBand Drumset Controller   ||\n||                                                            ||\n|| The engine is DTXMania with some graphic changes.          ||\n||                                                            ||\n|| All of the songs were found online, already converted to   ||\n|| the dtx/gda format. We have gone through and updated some  ||\n|| menus, and made the feel more like RockBand.               ||\n||                                                            ||\n|| DTXMania supports the ability to adjust difficulty. Change ||\n|| scroll and play rates, dark mode, reverse mode, hidden,    ||\n|| sudden, tight mode, auto hit, and much much more.          ||\n||                                                            ||\n|| All of the games include the standard Easy, Medium, Hard,  ||\n|| &amp; Expert modes. Plus a bonus REAL mode which is awesome    ||\n|| and is for a full drum kit. The RockBand Drum Kit will     ||\n|| NOT work for Real without disabling the extra tracks.      ||\n|| The Real version includes hi-hat, symbol, crash, floor     ||\n|| tom and other new-to-rockband targets.                     ||\n||                                                            ||\n|| Guitar, Bass and Vocals are not supported in this version. ||\n||                                                            ||\n|| All in all, this is the perfect tool to practice on!       ||\n|| Your friends will wonder how you know the songs so well!   ||\n||                                                            ||\n|| Beware of the risks... or possible benefits.               ||\n||                                                            ||\n|| Please read INSTALL.txt and thank you for downloading!!    ||\n||                                                            ||\n||                                        -The Squirrel Gods  ||\n||                                                            ||\n+==============================================================+\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n The initial seeding may take a while but please hang in there!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11cda4103d9b5b1278fa350d1f63144d77c71ae0","amp;dn":"Rock+Band+Percussion+%28PC+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11cda4103d9b5b1278fa350d1f63144d77c71ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,205,164,16,61,155,91,18,120,250,53,13,31,99,20,77,119,199,26,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
