Sci-fi aficionados should note that although most of the stories were written by Al Feldstein, 50 Girls 50 features three of EC's legendary Ray Bradbury adaptations, including &quot;I, Rocket&quot; and &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ and a unique curiosity, a strip adapted from a short story submitted by a teen-aged Harlan Ellison.\n\nWilliamson ran with a gang of like-minded young Turks dubbed the &quot;Fleagle Gang,&quot; who would help one another out on assignments. Thus this book includes three stories upon which Williamson was joined by the legendary Frank Frazetta, and one story (&quot;Food for Thought&quot;) where Roy Krenkel provided his exquisite alien landscapes, to make it one of the most gorgeous EC stories ever printed. As a supplementary bonus, 50 Girls 50 includes three stories drawn by Fleagles sans Williamson: Frazetta's Shock SuspenStories short &quot;Squeeze Play&quot;; Krenkel's meticulous &quot;Time to Leave&quot;; and Angelo Torres's &quot;An Eye for an Eye,&quot; an EC story that famously fell prey to censorship and was not released until the 1970s. As with other Fantagraphics EC titles, 50 Girls 50 also includes extensive story notes by EC experts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5dea914aee9e6e29f12720ed4a7fb2c429321c4","amp;dn":"Al+Williamson+-+50+Girls+50+And+Other+Stories+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5dea914aee9e6e29f12720ed4a7fb2c429321c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,222,169,20,174,233,230,226,159,18,114,14,212,167,251,44,66,147,33,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
