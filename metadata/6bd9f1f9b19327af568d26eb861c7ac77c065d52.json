One of the most important Greek poets of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his eminent lyrical writing, inspired by a deep feeling for the Hellenic world of culture.&quot;\r\n\r\nWandering and exile are present in Seferis's poetry, and his work is attuned to the history of Greece -- the Nobel Prize committee recognized him as a &quot;representative Hellenic poet.&quot;  His poetry often intertwines contemporary speech and experience with Homeric myth, and many of his poems depict the landscape of the Mediterranean.  In their Foreword to his COLLECTED POEMS, translators Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard noted: &quot;The distinguishing attribute of Seferis's genius -- one that he shares with Yeats and Eliot -- was always his ability to make out of a local politics, out of a personal history or mythology, some sort of general statement or metaphor.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following texts are in PDF format:\r\n\r\n* The Art of Poetry, no. 13 (Paris Review, Fall 1970).
