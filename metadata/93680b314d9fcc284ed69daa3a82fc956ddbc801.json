One of 2012's biggest underground rock albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this year's Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats, perhaps? Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is the work of a deliberately enigmatic commune/collective who have supposedly built themselves some kind of snowbound psychedelic Shangri-La in a tiny village in Sweden's far north. Korpilombolo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so we are to believe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has a mysterious, long-established tradition of voodoo worship, and local priests have been serenading the townsfolk with various strains of far-out, pan-global incantations for generations; Goat are merely the current vessel for this time-honoured mystical practice, don't you know. Whatever the truth of all that, World Music sounds incredible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a pitch-perfect mix of Black Sabbath, Can, Fela Kuti, Funkadelic and the northern-lights psych of countrymen such as PÃƒÂ¤rson Sound or TrÃƒÂ¤d GrÃƒÂ¤s och Stenar. It's overflowing with ingenious riffing, intoxicating chants and almighty freakouts, all with an exceptional dynamic bite and poppy concision that make it utterly accessible and head-spinningly great fun throughout. Beautifully realised, immaculately recorded, and one of the year's loveliest vinyl artefacts to boot\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93680b314d9fcc284ed69daa3a82fc956ddbc801","amp;dn":"Goat+-+World+Music+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93680b314d9fcc284ed69daa3a82fc956ddbc801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,104,11,49,77,159,204,40,78,214,157,170,58,130,252,149,109,219,200,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
