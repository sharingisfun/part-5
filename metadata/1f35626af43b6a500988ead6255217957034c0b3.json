This SDK can make Casio fx-9860gsd to become good embedded controller board.\nThe drawback is it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have input/output port sufficiently to use ,however we can solve this drawback\nby use the external equipment to expand I/O port.\n\nImportant technical specification of Casio fx-9860gsd are as followÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n- Use CPU from Renesas (SuperH-3 32-bit RISC processor) run at 100/133 MHz (depent on the working\nmode)\n- RAM 512 kB\n- 4 MB Flash memory (can actually use about 1.5 MB)\n- Download program to the calculator via mini USB by using FA-124 software.\n- One channel serial port.\n- Addition application can be appended to the calculator by ourselve.\n- Develop program using C language and the SDK is free for download.\n- Have SD card slot (SD card used for install new application or store the data).\n- Noise tolerant and high stability.\n- Can exchange the program between two calculators using the special signal-wire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f35626af43b6a500988ead6255217957034c0b3","amp;dn":"Casio_Scientific_Calculator.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f35626af43b6a500988ead6255217957034c0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,53,98,106,244,59,106,80,9,136,234,214,37,82,23,149,112,52,192,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
