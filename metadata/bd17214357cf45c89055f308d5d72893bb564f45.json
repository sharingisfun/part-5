You fall in love with him, of course.\n\nPagan Moore doesn't cheat Death, but instead, falls in love with him.\n\nSeventeen year old Pagan Moore has seen souls her entire life. Once she realized the strangers she often saw walking through walls were not visible to anyone else, she started ignoring them. If she didn't let them know she could see them, then they left her alone. Until she stepped out of her car the first day of school and saw an incredibly sexy guy lounging on a picnic table, watching her with an amused smirk on his face. Problem is, she knows he's dead.\n\nNot only does he not go away when she ignores him, but he does something none of the others have ever done. He speaks. Pagan is fascinated by the soul. What she doesn't realize is that her appointed time to die is drawing near and the wickedly beautiful soul she is falling in love with is not a soul at all.\nHe is Death and he's about to break all the rules.\n\n                             Book 01 - Existence\n\n                             Book 02 - Predestined\n\n                             Book 2.5- Leif\n\n                             Book 03 - Ceaseless\n\n\n\n                             Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                             Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n                 Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n \n                   &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd17214357cf45c89055f308d5d72893bb564f45","amp;dn":"Existence+Trilogy+by+Abines+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd17214357cf45c89055f308d5d72893bb564f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,23,33,67,87,207,69,200,144,85,243,8,213,215,40,147,187,86,79,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
