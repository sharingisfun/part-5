But a century ago, Arawn's followers were scoured from the kingdom of Mallon. Their temples smashed. Their secrets lost.\nWhen Dante tracks down a copy of their holiest book, he throws himself into its study--and finds himself under siege in the city streets. Arawn's believers aren't dead. They're in hiding, and they want back their book. With the help of the nether and a loudmouthed bodyguard named Blays, Dante escapes into the wilds. But Arawn's army is ready to march from the shadows. As they move against Mallon, they hunt Dante relentlessly, in search of the book.\nAnd with his powers growing by the day, Dante finds himself used as a tool in the war against them. He and Blays are dispatched on a thousand-mile journey to assassinate the Arawnites' leader. If they fail, their homeland will fall.\n\nThe Great Rift (Book 2)\nFive years ago, young sorcerer Dante Galand and his friend Blays averted war against their new home, the city of Narashtovik. Ever since, they've been repaying their debts, arming and training the nomadic norren people in preparation for rebellion against the empire that enslaves them. \nWhen Dante hears a nearby norren clan is in possession of the Quivering Bow--a legendary artifact that can strike down walls with a single arrow--his course is clear. With such a weapon, he can secure independence for both the norren and Narashtovik. But the bow has been taken by the enemy. Following a trail of pirates and slavers, Dante, Blays, and a clan of norren warriors strike deep into enemy lands. \nUntil now, their rebellion's been kept secret. But their quest for the bow leads Dante and Blays to an all-out assault on the personal manor of powerful lord Cassinder. Enraged, Cassinder will have his revenge on norren and Narashtovik alike--and this time, there may be no stopping the engines of war.\n\nThe Black Star (Book 3)\nThe Chainbreakers' War freed the norren. Won independence for Narashtovik. And drove a rift between Dante and Blays that may never be mended.\nAfter three years of wandering, Blays has returned to Gask. Blaming its king for the loss of his love, Lira, he poses as a merchant and infiltrates the enemy nobility. His goal is to bankrupt the kingdom and force its ruler from the throne. But his scheme is ruined when Dante arrives and outs him to the king.\nIn desperation, Blays flees to the one place Dante can't follow: the forbidden Pocket Cove. There, he intends to learn whatever secrets have kept its people hidden for centuries. Meanwhile, Dante is called back to Narashtovik. Strange lights have been seen in the nearby Wodun Mountains. His investigation reveals the lights herald the return of the Black Star, a long-lost item capable of making wishes real. With it, Dante plans to make himself immortal.\nTo find it, he must cross the Woduns into the mysterious country of Weslee. But there are others vying for the Black Star--and if they find it first, they will use it to scour Narashtovik from the earth.\n\nTHE CYCLE OF ARAWN is a complete trilogy of 1600 pages--over half a million words of strife, civil war, friendships made and broken, and one man's obsession to become the greatest sorcerer since the days of the gods.\n\n\n\nNote 1: I bought this and thought i should share.. \nNote 2: This is the Omnibus Edition (3-in-1)\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
