It is the ideal solution for mixing: you can use it as a frequency overlap detector and actually see which part of the spectrum every single instrument uses. It is now also possible to easily compare the spectrum ofseveral instances (for EQ matching or response curve measurement)thanks to the new 'Diff' view which displays the difference between several curves.\n\n\n\nBlue.Cat.Audio.Blue.Cats.Liny.EQ.v5.02-R2R\n\nBlue Cat's Liny EQ is an 8 bands linear phase equalizer with very low latency and comprehensive visual feedback: thanks to its highly optimized linear phase kernel, it processes the signal without phase distortion, with an unusually short latency (less than 3 milliseconds).\n\n\n\n\nBlue.Cat.Audio.Blue.Cats.MB-7.Mixer.v2.11.READ.NFO-R2R\n\nBlue Cat's MB-7 Mixer is a unique plug-in that splits the signal into several frequency bands and lets you mix and process them as if they were separate tracks.\n\n\n\nBlue.Cat.Audio.Blue.Cats.Oscilloscope.Multi.v2.03-R2R\n\nBlue Cat's Oscilloscope Multi is a unique multiple tracks real time waveform renderer and comparator: it lets you visualize the content of several audio tracks on the same screen and compare them thanks to its X-Y view.\n\n\nBlue.Cat.Audio.Blue.Cats.Protector.v2.03-R2R\n\nBlue Cat's Protector is a 0 dB stereo brickwall limiter with adjustable dynamics response. It will typically find its place on the master bus of your DAW to protect your audio output from overshoot, limit the general volume and improve the perceived loudness, thanks to a very transparent frequency response.\n\n\n\nBlue.Cat.Audio.Blue.Cats.StereoScope.Multi.v2.03-R2R\n\nBlue Cat's StereoScope Multi is a unique tool to compare the stereo image of several tracks in real time. It is the ideal solution for mixing: you can actually see which part of the stereo field every single instrument uses. It can also be used to analyze an effect chain and see how audio effects influence the stereo image of your content.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n\nPlatforms: Win-AAX / Win-DX / Win-RTAS / Win-VST / Win x64-AAX / Win x64-DX / Win x64-VST\n\nPlugins require Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 runtime.\nSearch and install when you cannot even run the plugin.\nSearch key word : &quot;vcredist 2008&quot;\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uninstall previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it! Done.\n\n\n3Nj0Y!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8b61181d6cdcfb5e24e136ffee023901139f5d","amp;dn":"Blue+Cat+Audio+Plugins+Pack+11.1.2014+-+R2R+%5Bdeepstatus%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5B1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8b61181d6cdcfb5e24e136ffee023901139f5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,139,97,24,29,108,220,251,94,36,225,54,255,238,2,57,1,19,159,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
