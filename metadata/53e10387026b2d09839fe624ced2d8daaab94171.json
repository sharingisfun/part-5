Following the trail, we go to the Bao family village and see the villagers act a Ming murder story. Like many authoritarian states, the Ming were obsessive about architecture. We see the giant fortifications of the Great Wall, the ritual enclaves of the Forbidden City in Beijing and travel with bargeman Mr Hu down the Grand Canal, China's great artery of commerce right up to the present day. We then hear about Admiral Zheng He's voyages to Africa and the Gulf decades before Columbus, watch the construction of an ocean-going wooden boat 250ft long, and hitch a ride on a replica Ming junk in the South China Sea.\r\nAs state prosperity grew, so did a rising middle class. Wood looks at Ming culture in Suzhou, the 'Venice of China'. Staying in a merchant's house, he discovers the silk, ceramic and lacquer-making industries, and visits one of the most beautiful gardens in the city. Then on to Macao and the arrival of Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci, who hoped to convert China to Christianity. In the cathedral in Beijing, we learn more about these fateful exchanges with the West. Finally in Shaoxing, we visit the house of the 'Ming Proust' and at grassroots the Zhao family in Fujian where the film ends in an elegiac mood with the fall of the Ming in 1644.\r\n                                                This is Part 4 of a 6 Part series\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/The-Ming-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/The-Ming-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/The-Ming-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/The-Ming-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/The-Ming-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/The-Ming-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/The-Ming-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/The-Ming-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/The-Ming-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/The-Ming-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/The-Ming-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/The-Ming-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/12/The-Ming-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/The-Ming-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/The-Ming-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/The-Ming-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3008 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b070p2q0\r\n\r\n2)  The Story of China \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Ancestors \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Silk%20Roads%20and%20China%20Ships \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Golden%20Age","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e10387026b2d09839fe624ced2d8daaab94171","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Story+of+China+The+Ming+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e10387026b2d09839fe624ced2d8daaab94171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,225,3,135,2,107,45,9,131,159,230,36,206,210,216,218,170,185,65,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
