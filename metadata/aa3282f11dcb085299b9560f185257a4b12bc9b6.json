This movie is impossible to buy, and this is the only torrent out there. Help spread Speed's message!\n\nTimothy (Speed) Levitch, the loquacious subject of Bennet Miller's fascinating documentary, is a Manhattan tour-bus guide who happens also to be a sidewalk philosopher, improvisatory poet and walking encyclopedia of New York City history. More than anything, he is a free spirit. Although he can be irritating at times, Mr. Levitch is a true original, an erudite, intellectual version of a classic motor-mouthed New York cabby. As he interweaves his personal story between spiels about New York City landmarks, the city (beautifully photographed in black and white) seems to come as alive as the man who is describing it.
