Each round, one player asks a question from a Black Card, and everyone else answers with their funniest White Card.\n\n\nCards Against Humanity is available under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 2.0 license. That means you can use and remix the game for free, but you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make a commercial use out of it, including ads.
