T. Wright - Christian Origins and the Question of God, Volumes 1-3.\n\nEpub and mobi files from a retail source.\n\n\nThis series is Wright's major work and is one of the most important series of works in New Testament scholarship for many years.\n\n\n1. The New Testament and the People of God (Fortress, 1992).\n\nThis first volume in the series Christian Origins and the Question of God provides a historical, theological, and literary study of first-century Judaism and Christianity. Wright offers a preliminary discussion of the meaning of the word god within those cultures, as he explores the ways in which developing an understanding of those first-century cultures are of relevance for the modern world.\n\n2. Jesus and the Victory of God (Fortress, 1997).\n\nThis major work, volume two of a larger multi-volume project, seeks to present a comprehensive, detailed, yet highly readable assessment of the historical and theological questions surrounding the origins of Christianity.\nIn Jesus and the Victory of God, N. T. Wright offers a penetrating assessment of the major scholarly contributions to the current Ã¢â‚¬ËœquestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for the historical Jesus. He then sets out in fascinating detail his own compelling account of how Jesus himself understood his mission: how be believed himself called to remake Israel, the people of God, around himself; how he announced GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s judgment on the Israel of his day, especially its Temple and hierarchy; and how he saw his own movement as the divinely ordained fulfillment of IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s destiny. This revolutionary message, articulated in parables and acted out symbolically in healings and celebratory meals, drew Jesus to JerusalemÃ¢â‚¬â€where, as he came to realize, his vocation demanded that he would die the death he had announced for the people. In obedience to this vocation, Jesus had come to realize that he was claiming to do and be what, in Jewish thought, only God can do and be.\n\n3. The Resurrection of the Son of God (Fortress, 2003).\n\nIn this volume, N. T. Wright takes us on a fascinating journey through ancient beliefs about life after death, from the shadowy figures who inhabit HomerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hades, through PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope for a blessed immortality, to the first century, where the Greek and Roman world (apart from the Jews) consistently denied any possibility of resurrection. We then examine ancient Jewish beliefs on the same subject, from the Bible to the Dead Sea Scrolls and beyond. This sets the scene for a full-scale examination of early Christian beliefs about resurrection in general and that of Jesus in particular, beginning with Paul and working through to the start of the third century. Wright looks at all the evidence, and asks: Why did Christians agree with Jewish resurrection belief while introducing into itÃ¢â‚¬â€across the boardÃ¢â‚¬â€significant modifications? To answer this question we come to the strange and evocative Easter stories in the gospels and asks whether they can have been late inventions. Wright seeks the best historical conclusions about the empty tomb and the belief that Jesus really did rise bodily from the dead, recognizing that it was this belief that caused early Christians to call Jesus Ã¢â‚¬Å“Son of God.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In doing so, they posed a political challenge as well as a theological one. These challenges retain their power in the twenty-first century.\n\n---\n\nMany, MANY thanks to the original uploader.\n\n---\n\nAfter a decade-long break, the fourth volume in the series is scheduled for publication in November 2013.\n\n---\n\nFor a much less academic set of works by N.
