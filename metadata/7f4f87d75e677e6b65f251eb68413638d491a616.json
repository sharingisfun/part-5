RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Securom\n             1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Strategy\n             \n\n\n Special Note:\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n Hello SKIDROW friends! Today we have to discuss a serious issue with you:\n your securom 'cracks'. It has been for a long time already that some\n web/p2p groups created loaders for securom games by patching the paul.dll\n activation routine to make the game run without activation.\n It took you many months to copy it, so we would like to congratulate you\n on finally being able to steal this method. Unfortunately for you though,\n this is not a crack. In fact, you seem to understand so little of the\n securom protection, that you don't understand how to identify a crack at\n all and incorrectly identify our gothic 4 crack as a lesser protected\n executable. The files that you call 'russian', are actually files that\n were originally encrypted by securom, but that we decrypted to be able to\n run the game with the cracked executable. If your Gothic crack would be\n anything close to a crack, you would have also needed to unpack these files.\n Since you, however, did not crack Gothic, but instead created a loader to\n bypass the activation and left all the protection code active, the securom\n code will take care of these files for you.\n Simple protection holes like these should remain in the private domain so\n they can be used to make proper cracks faster and so that protection\n companies do not fix them. This has been an unwritten agreement amongst\n crackers for many many years. As an example, we had a generic loader for\n Safedisc that we kept private until Safedisc went out of use. If we had\n released it publically earlier, it might have made Safedisc much harder\n for everyone.\n We are not sure why it took you this long, because it only takes 1 byte\n patched in memory to bypass the activation and we know you must be very\n happy that you can finally 'crack' securom games and get even more points\n in your self-created game scene charts, but please go back to the drawing\n board for a few more cracking lessons and stop trying to change the rules\n of the game for the worse.\n \n \n *Last minute update*\n \n an example of the poor quality of SKIDROW's securom 'cracks' is their\n release of Starpoint Gemini. In the words of the developer:\n \n DRM was in conflict with our own exe file and that caused everything. We\n came to an agreement with GG to drop the whole protection and release the\n unprotected version. Here's the exe file. GG will be releasing the\n unprotected version tomorrow.\n \n SKIDROW released the unprotected exe as a 'hotfix', but any real crack\n would have worked fine and not needed any fix at all.\n\n \n Game Information:\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n The game is a combination of a tactical game and a sports game The basics\n are extremely simple: two teams, one ball. The team that carries the ball\n into the opponent's end zone scores a touchdown, the team with the most\n touchdowns at the end of the game is the winner. However, it's how you\n decide to do this that makes things interesting, the ends justify the means!\n It's not just the players you have at your disposal either. You can bribe\n the referee's to look the other way as you cripple or trample annoying\n opponents and hire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the\n crowd... Blood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians' strategies. There\n are many races to accommodate every player's profile (20 in the Legendary\n Edition, 9 in the Standard Edition) and even more strategies for\n experimenting. Winning a game requires a strong game-sense and a lot of\n self-control. For the player's enjoyment, omnipresent humor and the use of\n spells, weapons, and other non-regulatory means place Blood Bowl outside of\n the classic sport simulation genre.\n\n \n             ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²   ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â² ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â² ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº   ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº   ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â² ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â² ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n            ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸     ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸   ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸    ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸     ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸   ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸  ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n \n 1.
