This experiment in pure theaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½featuring a remarkable cast of actors, including Wallace Shawn, Julianne Moore, Brooke Smith, and George GaynesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½would have been lost to time had it not been captured on film, with subtle cinematic brilliance, by Louis Malle. Vanya on 42nd Street is as memorable and emotional a screen version of ChekhovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s masterpiece as one could ever hope to see. This film, which turned out to be MalleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last, is a tribute to the playwrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s devastating work as well as to the creative process itself.\n\nRelease: Vanya.on.42nd.Street.1994.720p.BluRay.x264-PSYCHD\nRuntime..........: 02:00:26\nVideo codec: H264\nVideo............: 1200x720\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.667\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.220\nBit rate : 4 552 Kbps\nFrame rate.....: 23.976fps\nAudio.............: AC3 640 kbps\nFile Size..............: 4480mb\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111590/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111590/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English (in mkv), Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted originally at KG by prasopes, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9550b8c9e6e6dda6eaf151b4a9d5856f08a6d6f2","amp;dn":"Vanya.on.42nd.Street.1994.720p.BluRay.x264-PSYCHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9550b8c9e6e6dda6eaf151b4a9d5856f08a6d6f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,80,184,201,230,230,221,166,234,241,81,180,169,213,133,111,8,166,214,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
