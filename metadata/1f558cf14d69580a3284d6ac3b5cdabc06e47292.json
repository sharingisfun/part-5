They exasperated critics and eluded classification, synthesizing blues, rock, folk, rockabilly, funk, classical, country, Indian, and Arabic techniques. They performed the alchemical trick of transmuting base led into goldÃ¢â‚¬â€and platinumÃ¢â‚¬â€and diamond. They did what they would, finding wisdom through personal excess and artistic self-discipline.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Not a coda to ZeppelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy, but a blast of metaphysical graffiti as relevant today as the first time we heard the opening chords of Ã¢â‚¬ËœStairway to HeavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. From Kant to Ã¢â‚¬ËœKashmirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, from Freud to Ã¢â‚¬ËœFool in the RainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Calef and company explore ZeppelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music in an introspective, suggestive manner worthy of both a blistering Page solo and a bawdy Bonham stomp.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€BRANDON W. FORBES, co-editor of Radiohead and Philosophy\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Led ZeppelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums, personalities, live performances, art work, myths, influences, and more, all come under the microscope. Compelling insights and observations add more depth to a subject that continues to thrill and inspire. Each chapter is driven by an unquenchable thirst for Zeppelin knowledge and pulls the reader deeper into the world of Led Zeppelin . . .Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€DAVE LEWIS, editor, Tight But Loose&quot;\n\nThis torrent contains the original EPUB as well as a MOBI and large-print PDF conversion done in Calibre.
