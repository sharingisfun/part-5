Moscow, in 1961.\nRigorous, systematic study by renowned physicist offers advanced students a thorough background in mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics that stresses atomic, nuclear, and microscopic aspects. Especially strong in its coverage of statistical physics. Features 137 exercises, many with complete solutions. Translated by George Yankovsky with the author's supervision. 1961 edition.\n\nAuthor's Preface to 2nd Ed:\nIn this second edition I have attempted to make the presentation more systematic and rigorous without adding any difficulties. In order to do this it has been especially necessary to revise Part III, to which I have added a special section (Sec. 30) setting out the general principles of quantum mechanics; radiation is now considered only with the aid of the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field, since the results obtained from the correspondence principle do not appear sufficiently justified.\nGibbsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ statistics are included in this edition, which has made it necessary to divide Part IV into something in the nature of two cycles: Sec. 39-44, where only the results of combinatorial analysis are set out, and Sec. 45-52, an introduction to the GibbsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ method, which is used as background material for a discussion of thermodynamics. A phenomenological approach to thermodynamics would nowadays appear an anachronism in a course of theoretical physics.\nIn order not to increase the size of the book overmuch, it has been necessary to omit the theory of beta decay, the variational properties of eigenvalues, and certain other problems included in the first edition.\nI am greatly indebted to A. F. Nikiforov and V. B. Uvarov for pointing out several inaccuracies in the first edition of the book.\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nFrom the Preface to the First Edition\nPreface to the Second Edition\nPart I.
