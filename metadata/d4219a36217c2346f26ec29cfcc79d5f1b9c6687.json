This is the first movie-musical of Show Boat (there was an earlier silent version). I'm surprised no-one has put this on TPB yet, fortunately I've managed to scrounge a really good copy for my buccaneer brethren.\n\nRobeson obviously dominates the show, but the other singers do a great job as well. Don't take the story too seriously, just let the atmosphere wash over you... and summon up a mint julep.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4219a36217c2346f26ec29cfcc79d5f1b9c6687","amp;dn":"Show+Boat+%281936%29+Irene+Dunne+Paul+Robeson+et+al","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4219a36217c2346f26ec29cfcc79d5f1b9c6687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,33,154,54,33,124,35,70,242,110,194,156,252,199,157,95,27,156,102,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
