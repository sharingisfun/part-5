Volunteer-run or professional, membership- or employee-based, non- or for-profit, theyÃŠÂ¼re offering tools, education, and space to makers who donÃŠÂ¼t have a home shop or who want to go beyond it.\n\n\tPart recreational shop, part product incubator, part R&amp;D lab, part community center, they cater to Ã¢â‚¬â€ and help define Ã¢â‚¬â€ a growing, decentralized hub of the maker world. These are places where makers are safe, welcome, comfortable, and free to pursue their goals, where innovation and creativity is fostered, learning is encouraged, and community trumps just about everything.\n\n\tIn these pages youÃŠÂ¼ll see some makerspaces up close, as well as look at what they can do and how theyÃŠÂ¼re growing. YouÃŠÂ¼ll see some of their tools and their builds, and maybe youÃŠÂ¼ll be inspired to check one out in your area.
