The original premiere date was March 3, 2010, but had been postponed to March 10. This cycle\\\\\\'s catch phrase is \\\\\\&quot;Work It Out\\\\\\&quot;. The promotional song is \\\\\\&quot;Watch Me Move\\\\\\&quot; by Fefe Dobson.\n\nThe winner received management and representation by Wilhelmina Models, a $100,000 contract with CoverGirl cosmetics and a cover and six-page spread in Seventeen magazine. J. Alexander was removed from his post as a judge, but still remained as the runway coach. He was replaced by Vogue editor AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Leon Talley. The international destinations during this cycle were Auckland and Queenstown, New Zealand.\\\\\\&quot;\n\\\\\\&quot;A new rule this cycle enabled the girl called first at panel to receive the prize of the following week\\\\\\'s reward challenge, regardless of their performance at the actual challenge. If the same girl won the challenge, she was able to pick others to join her on the reward, or received additional prizes along with her challenge win.\n\nTop Model in Action was replaced with Top Model Lounge featuring Bianca Golden from Cycle 9 and Laura Kirkpatrick from Cycle 13 offering commentary about each week\\\\\\'s episode.\n\nThis cycle returned to featuring girls within the standard heights of the modeling industry (5\\\\\\'7\\\\\\&quot; and taller), unlike the previous cycle. In addition, Cycle 14 took place in New York City, having been set in Los Angeles for Cycle 13.\\\\\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e989b0e2f3d4d3f14e22784e97f35b0496d496ac","amp;dn":"Americas+Next+Top+Model+season+14+cycle+14+ANTM+english+subtitle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e989b0e2f3d4d3f14e22784e97f35b0496d496ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,137,176,226,243,212,211,241,78,34,120,78,151,243,91,4,150,212,150,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
