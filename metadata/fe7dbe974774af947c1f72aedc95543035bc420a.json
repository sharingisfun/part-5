Your web browser (or any \nother Internet application) is then configured to access \nthe Internet through Charles, and Charles is then able to \nrecord and display for you all of the data that is sent and \nreceived.\n\nIn Web and Internet development you are unable to see \nwhat is being sent and received between your web \nbrowser / client and the server. Without this visibility it is \ndifficult and time-consuming to determine exactly where \nthe fault is. Charles makes it easy to see what is \nhappening, so you can quickly diagnose and fix \nproblems.\n\nCharles makes debugging quick, reliable and advanced; \nsaving you time and frustration!\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\nSSL Proxying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ view SSL requests and responses in plain \ntext\nBandwidth Throttling to simulate slower Internet \nconnections including latency\nAJAX debugging ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ view XML and JSON requests and \nresponses as a tree or as text\nAMF ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ view the contents of Flash Remoting / Flex \nRemoting messages as a tree\nRepeat requests to test back-end changes\nEdit requests to test different inputs\nBreakpoints to intercept and edit requests or responses\nValidate recorded HTML, CSS and RSS/atom responses \nusing the W3C validator\n\nWhat's New?\nMinor bug fixes.\n--&gt; Repeat advanced tool: fix bug which caused it to \nstop prematurely after a number of requests\n--&gt; Auto save tool: fix bug where &quot;Enable on startup&quot; \ndidn't work\n\nInstallation:\n--&gt; Open folder &amp; mount dmg\n--&gt; Drag app to your applications folder\n--&gt; Use registration info from .txt file\n--&gt; Done!\n\nENJOY!!\n--&gt; IsolatedSoul5591","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe7dbe974774af947c1f72aedc95543035bc420a","amp;dn":"Charles+Web+Debugging+Proxy+v3.5.1+%5BIsolatedSoul5591%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe7dbe974774af947c1f72aedc95543035bc420a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,125,190,151,71,116,175,148,124,31,114,174,220,149,84,48,53,188,66,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
