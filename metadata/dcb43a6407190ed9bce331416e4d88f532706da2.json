That success hasn't necessarily translated to respect (or even ironic hipster appreciation) in most quarters; Manilow's music has been much maligned by critics and listeners alike, particularly the romantic ballads that made his career, which were derided as maudlin schlock even during his heyday. It's true that Manilow's taste for swelling choruses and lush arrangements often bordered on bombastic, but unlike many of his MOR peers, Manilow wasn't aiming to make smooth, restrained background music -- he conceived of himself as a pop entertainer and all-around showman in the classic mold, and his performances and stage shows were accordingly theatrical.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tArista\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Way We Were\n02.My Eyes Adored You\n03.Bridge Over Troubled Water\n04.How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\n05.It Never Rains In Southern California\n06.You've Got A Friend (Duet With Melissa Manchester)\n07.He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\n08.Sailing\n09.The Long And Winding Road\n10.(They Long To Be) Close To You\n11.If\n12.Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\n13.Mandy\n14.Weekend In New England\n15.Copacabana (At The Copa)\n16.Even Now\n17.Looks Like We Made It\n18.I Write The Songs\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcb43a6407190ed9bce331416e4d88f532706da2","amp;dn":"Barry+Manilow+-+Greatest+Songs+Of+The+70%5C%27s+%282007%29+CDRip+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcb43a6407190ed9bce331416e4d88f532706da2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,180,58,100,7,25,14,217,188,227,49,65,110,77,136,245,50,112,109,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
