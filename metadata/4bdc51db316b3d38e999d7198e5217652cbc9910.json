In this, Gaiman's first book of short stories, his imagination and supreme artistry transform a mundane world into a place of terrible wonders -- a place where an old woman can purchase the Holy Grail at a thrift store, where assassins advertise their services in the Yellow Pages under &quot;Pest Control,&quot; and where a frightened young boy must barter for his life with a mean-spirited troll living beneath a bridge by the railroad tracks. Explore a new reality -- obscured by smoke and darkness, yet brilliantly tangible -- in this extraordinary collection of short works by a master prestidigitator. It will dazzle your senses, touch your heart, and haunt your dreams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bdc51db316b3d38e999d7198e5217652cbc9910","amp;dn":"Neil+Gaiman+-+Smoke+and+Mirrors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bdc51db316b3d38e999d7198e5217652cbc9910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,220,81,219,49,107,61,56,233,153,215,25,142,82,23,101,44,188,153,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
