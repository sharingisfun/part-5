Doing public relationsÃ¢â‚¬â€even for politiciansÃ¢â‚¬â€was strictly business...until he was hired as NASAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s public affairs director and discovered a client he could believe in. Proud of the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history and sure of its destiny, he was thrilled to be a part of its futureÃ¢â‚¬â€a bright era of far-reaching space exploration.\n\nBut public disinterest and budget cuts changed that future. Now, a half century after the first moon landing, Jerry feels like the only one with starsÃ¢â‚¬â€and unexplored planets and solar systemsÃ¢â‚¬â€in his eyes.\n\nStill, Jerry does his job, trying to drum up interest in the legacy of the agency. Then a fifty-year-old secret about the Apollo XI mission is revealed, and he finds himself embroiled in the biggest controversy of the twenty-first century, one that will test his abilityÃ¢â‚¬â€and his willingnessÃ¢â‚¬â€to spin the truth about a conspiracy of reality-altering proportions...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3197b5cb559b8e17b2d271894de685d41a5e29ea","amp;dn":"The+Cassandra+Project+by+Jack+McDevitt++Mike+Resnick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3197b5cb559b8e17b2d271894de685d41a5e29ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,151,181,203,85,155,142,23,178,210,113,137,77,230,133,212,26,94,41,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
