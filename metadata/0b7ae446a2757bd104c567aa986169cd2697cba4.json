I want all of my friends to feel what I felt when I read this. Hope it touches your heart like it did mine.&quot;\n\nA joke then follows: &quot;A little boy said to his mother; 'Mommy, how come I'm black and you're white?' His mother replied, 'Don't even go there Barack! From what I can remember about that party, you're lucky you don't bark!'&quot;\n\nCebull forwarded the offensive email from his official court account to six &quot;old buddies,&quot; who then forwarded it to others.\n\nInterestingly, the news piece continued and mentioned that this is not the first instance of an official coming under fire for sending a racist Obama email. In April 2011, an Orange County GOP official sent out an email with a photo of Obama's face superimposed on the body of a baby chimpanzee.\n\n\nWe have 22 titles in this upload about the subject of Slavery.
