So, alongside Edgar Froese, Thorsten Quaeschning and violinist Hoshiko Yamane there is now the sublime (and modern electronica-credible) Ulrich Schnauss. The addition of Ulrich to the line-up is an interesting move as he is already a highly regarded solo-artist in his own right and a huge TD fan to boot.\nAnd so to celebrate their upcoming tour of Australia, there is this new Cupdisc EP. With a running time of nearly 53 Minutes and the first product available of what TD are calling: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Quantum YearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe CDS Towers verdictÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nThe Ã¢â‚¬ËœMala KuniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“CupdiscÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ EP is one amazing value for-money release for al least two reasonsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n1. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting what most people would consider to be a full albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of music on it, andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n2. All that music is fantastic! The sequencing in intricate, tight and flowing. The melodies are warm, captivating, haunting and to die for! Frankly speaking, this really is CLASSY electronic music CD!\nTo be in the business as long as Edgar Froese has and still mange to pull such strength of material out of the bag as this, he really does deserve to be congratulated.\nThe integration of new member Ulrich Schnauss into the core line-up seams to have been a seamless transition, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m certain he has brought a new dimension to the TD sound without ant sweeping changes having been made to the traditional construction of their music. There is certainly that feel of the electronic mid-70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s having come back into the TD sound, but its very much more polished and production perfect than it was way back then\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœMala KuniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the names of two Aboriginal tribes who (according to Aboriginal mythology) lived on either side of Uluru (Ayers Rock). One tribe dwelled in shade (Kunia) the other in sun (Mala), and as well as providing inspiration for the music, maybe this is a subtle indication of where TD's music is heading these days.\nPersonally speaking, for me it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter what the inspiration for the music is, it just simply sounds great as seven pieces of professionally constructed electronic music that both excites and moves me at the same time!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœMala KuniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was released on 17th November 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:883ace16bbdbb209d6d26205613b0b3d84803520","amp;dn":"Tangerine+Dream+-+Mala+Kunia+%282014%29+%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"883ace16bbdbb209d6d26205613b0b3d84803520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,58,206,22,187,219,178,9,214,210,98,5,97,59,11,61,132,128,53,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
