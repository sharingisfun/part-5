It is very outdated. It does not feature modern refrigerants, tools, or service techniques. While some of the information will always be applicable to the field, the information is researched, borrowed...not from the authors' experience in the field. My father was teaching me in the late 1960's. Had he given me this book I would have thought it useful but a bit old fashioned. You can tell the authors do not practice in the field or the shop or they would have realized their information was from the refrigeration dinosaur age!\n\nProfessional-level air conditioning and refrigeration guidance to get the job done faster, better, and at less cost\nThis heavily-illustrated resource is great for do-it-yourself, weekend repairmen, as well as seasoned air conditioning and refrigeration technicians who want to stay on top of the latest methods, materials, equipment, codes, standards, and safety tips.\n\nFilled with easy-to-read tables and charts, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration covers:\n\nFundamentals of air conditioning and refrigeration\nStep-by-step instructions for installation, repair, and maintenance\nTroubleshooting advice\nProblems and worked-out equations will have SI units for international usage\nProfessional organizations\nImportant web sites\nValuable tips on buying air conditioning or refrigeration units\nThe most up-to-date tools and devices used in the trade ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b769c0bf5b4965455a4f551f7d3acc59d3d713e8","amp;dn":"Air+Conditioning+and+Refrigeration+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b769c0bf5b4965455a4f551f7d3acc59d3d713e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,105,192,191,91,73,101,69,90,79,85,31,125,58,204,89,211,215,19,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
