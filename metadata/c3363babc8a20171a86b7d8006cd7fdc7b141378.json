It has been certified Gold in the United States with worldwide sales reaching 750,000. It is said the album received its name from the band members' attitudes that life should be lived as if only one day remains. Guitarist Mark Tremonti also said in an interview that the title is a reference to the title cards that appeared in the movie Donnie Darko, and it is one of the names the band considered using before settling with Alter Bridge.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4656/2004ii4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4656/2004ii4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
