He enjoyed enormous popularity, but in one of the mysteries of literary history he was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death.  Ovid's poetry was much imitated during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and greatly influenced Western art and literature.\n\nThis collection includes two translations of the METAMORPHOSES, a 15-book epic narrative that chronicles the history of the world from its creation to the deification of Julius Caesar within a loose mythico-historical framework; the ART OF LOVE (Ars Amatoria), an instructional elegy series in three books; and the FASTI, an incomplete six-book exploration of Roman religion that is structured as a series of eye-witness reports and interviews by the first-person vates with Roman deities, who explain the origins of Roman holidays and associated customs.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB + MOBI format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* THE ART OF LOVE (Modern Library, 2002).  Translated by James Michie with an Introduction by David Malouf.\n\n* FASTI (Oxford World's Classics, 2011).  Translated with an Introduction and Notes by Anne and Peter Wiseman.\n\n* THE METAMORPHOSES (Viking, 1958).
