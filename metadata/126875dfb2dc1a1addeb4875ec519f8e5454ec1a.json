The series was created by Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, who wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, as opposed to children only. It revolves around a Denver family, the Duncans, as they try to adjust to the birth of their fourth child, Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Duncan (Mia Talerico). In each episode, Teddy Duncan (Bridgit Mendler) creates a video diary containing advice for Charlie about their family and life as a teenager. Teddy tries to show Charlie what she might go through when she is older in the video diaries for future reference. Each video diary ends with Teddy (or someone else from the family, even Charlie) saying the eponymous phrase, &quot;Good luck, Charlie.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:126875dfb2dc1a1addeb4875ec519f8e5454ec1a","amp;dn":"Good+Luck+Charlie+Season+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"126875dfb2dc1a1addeb4875ec519f8e5454ec1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,104,117,223,178,220,26,26,221,235,72,117,236,81,159,142,84,84,236,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
