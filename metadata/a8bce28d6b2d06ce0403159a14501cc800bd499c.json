In his new book, Sturgess demonstrates how to use a wide range of yoga meditation practices as a portal to higher consciousness. \n \nInitial chapters explain what yoga meditation is and why it is so useful in our busy, modern lives. Here, Sturgess gives insight into the Eight Limbs of Yoga (an established approach to the successive stages of yoga) and enlightens us on the workings of our internal energy system Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all of which lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of the practices to come. Sturgess then guides us through the key seated meditation postures and a range of helpful mudras (hand gestures) and bandhas (energetic seals) before going on to offer clear, step-by-step guidance on a wide choice of the most effective yoga postures, purification practices, breathing exercises and meditation techniques to still the mind and awaken the inner spirit. In the final chapter he recommends how to put these practices together in the form of nourishing daily routines to suit your individual needs, as well as giving advice on how to establish an overall healthy lifestyle, based on ancient Indian health traditions. \n \nBeautifully illustrated, highly practical and deeply inspirational, this is the ideal guide to establishing a regular holistic health program. It will allow you to connect with your true divine Inner Self, realize your fullest potential for creative thought and action, and establish balance, harmony and happiness in every aspect of your life.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8bce28d6b2d06ce0403159a14501cc800bd499c","amp;dn":"Yoga+Meditation-+Stephen+Sturgess+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8bce28d6b2d06ce0403159a14501cc800bd499c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,188,226,141,107,45,6,206,4,3,21,154,20,80,28,200,0,189,73,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
