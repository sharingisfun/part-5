Recently rediscovered in archived files, It's the best version I've played on a computer.\n\nNo installation required. It's runs within its own container. Just place anywhere and launch.\n\nAbsolutely clean. I installed this on my mothers computer.\n\nThis should run on anything with flash installed but hasn't been tested on the most modern operating systems.\n\nDrag to re-size game as desired. Not locked into any resolution.  \n\n\nYou can enable special block patterns in options but the game always starts with default block patterns that everyone is familiar with.\n\nMy best score is 8120 with default blocks. Good luck  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8849662d116b60b1978e4539ebd125f01c8f071a","amp;dn":"Tetris+%28the+best+I%27ve+found%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8849662d116b60b1978e4539ebd125f01c8f071a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,73,102,45,17,107,96,177,151,142,69,57,235,209,37,240,28,143,7,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
