Born in Ivory Coast, he's currently exiled in Mali. His constant fight against Laurent Bagbo's dictatorship, the french neo-colonialism, the cancellation of Third-World debt and the new US military implantations are the main themes of his work. Here in France, and especially in Brittany (i'm a breton, wich is quite different from a french...), Tiken Jah is considered as the new Africa's herald. \nMore infos on www.tikenjah.net\n\nSongs are in french, english &amp; dioula (native language of ppl in parts of Ivory coast, Mali, Burkina Faso &amp; Togo)\nLyrics included\n\nTrack List\t\t\tDur.\tApprox. translation\n\n01 - Plus rienne m'&amp;eacute;tonne\t         3:35\t(I'm no longer surprised)\n02 - Quitte le pouvoir\t\t4:24\t(Give the power back)\n03 - Aloumaye\t\t\t5:23\n04 - Tonton d'America\t\t4:04\t(The american uncle)\n05 - D&amp;eacute;m&amp;eacute;\t\t\t         4:11\n06 - Ca va faire mal\t\t3:53\t(It will hurt)\n07 - Kuma\t\t\t         3:11\n08 - O&amp;ugrave; veux-tu que j'aille ?\t3:18\t(Where can I go ?)\n09 - L'Afrique doit du fric\t         4:41\t(Africa owes dough)\n10 - Sauver\t\t\t4:23\t(Rescue)\n11 - Imadjigui\t\t\t4:31\n12 - Allah\t\t\t4:03\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8126efd93524618f3f34e334ac20e64a4dba64f6","amp;dn":"Tiken+Jah+Fakoly+-+Coup+de+Gueule","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8126efd93524618f3f34e334ac20e64a4dba64f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,38,239,217,53,36,97,143,63,52,227,52,172,32,230,74,77,186,100,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
