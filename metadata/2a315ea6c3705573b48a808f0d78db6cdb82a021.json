Locals overhear her wishing aloud for her husband's death; when he dies of a stroke not long after, she is accused of witchcraft, a charge taken seriously enough to be punishable by death. Eventually, the poor woman is tortured and traumatized to such a point that she actually believes she is a witch - and she gives in to being burned at the stake. Yet Dreyer then shifts the perspective from internalized - illustrating the woman's paralyzing fear - to externalized, a point of view that enables the director to depict his subject's spiritual purification. Even allowing for the aura of raw terror, Dreyer never loses sight of the eroticism inherent in the concept of witchcraft. Based on a play by Wiers Jensen, Day of Wrath was filmed during the Nazi occupation of Denmark and not released abroad until after the war, and the director reportedly had to flee his native country when he angered the government with the film's political content. \n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Vredens Dag.1943.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 341 Kbps\nLength            : 4.99 GiB for 1h 37mn 17s 422ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 958 x 720 (1.331) at 24.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : da\n\nAudio #1          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036506/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036506/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Danish\nSubtitles: English\n\nSecond audio is commentary, with English subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a315ea6c3705573b48a808f0d78db6cdb82a021","amp;dn":"Vredens+Dag.1943.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a315ea6c3705573b48a808f0d78db6cdb82a021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,49,94,166,195,112,85,115,180,138,128,143,13,120,219,108,219,130,160,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
