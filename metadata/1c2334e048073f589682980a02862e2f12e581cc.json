Call to Arms (14:24)\n\n  &quot;Black Grease&quot; says it all, blackly: Austin's Black Angels temper stoned Black Sabbath drone with Black Keys bluesy bombast, producing a sort of boozy psychedelic White Light/White Heat in the process. The aforementioned song takes the record's central aesthetic idea and spirals it out of control. The shamanistic lyrics here rise as a single mantra of &quot;Kill, kill, kill, kill,&quot; and the filthy reverberating guitars are kept to an acidic simmer, all so that Passover's real focus -- that is, Stephanie Bailey's insidious percussion -- reaches a level of unconscious insistence that feels almost locomotive, tumbling over itself too fast to safely stop. Other tracks, like seething, stately &quot;Empire,&quot; wear the band's Velvet Underground influence more proudly, keeping the drums at a steady patter and letting the guitars scramble like rats up a well. Passover is a reactionary record, trading in Vietnam imagery and tired Doors tropes in places as easily as it does stoopid-awesome stoner rock in others, but it seems a reaction of the very best kind -- that is, free of agenda, full of ideas, and fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c2334e048073f589682980a02862e2f12e581cc","amp;dn":"The+Black+Angels+-+Passover+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c2334e048073f589682980a02862e2f12e581cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,35,52,224,72,7,63,88,150,130,152,10,2,134,46,47,18,229,129,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
