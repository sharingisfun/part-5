Their early material has been compared by critics to Deep Purple, but by the mid-1980s they had moved to a more commercial hard rock style. Four of the band's earliest albums reached the top 10 in the UK, with Ready an' Willing (1980), Come an' Get It (1981), Saints &amp; Sinners (1982) and Slide It In (1984). The band's 1987 self-titled album was their most commercially successful worldwide, and contained three of their most recognisable songs, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, &quot;Still of the Night&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot;. In 1988, Whitesnake was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group.[1] In 2005, Whitesnake was named the 85th greatest hard rock band of all time by VH1.\nSource:Wikipedia\n\n BBC Review:\nFew bands defined the sound or the fashion of 80s hard rock more than Whitesnake, the band pieced together by former Deep Purple man, David Coverdale, in 1977. There was the look: the epic, bleach-blond curls and tight black leather. There were the sleeves: lurid, masturbatory images from a world before political correctness - see the cover to 1979's Lovehunter, a naked woman straddling a huge, coiled python. And there was the music: chugging, swaggering rock 'n' roll that updated the smoked sounds of 70s blues rock with added swagger, machismo, and pomp.\nDespite a thorough repackaging and remastering job, though, this 3CD collection shines a light on a catalogue that has not dated especially well. It's not just the issue of sexual politics, although their standpoint is undeniably outdated: ''Do I look the kind of guy who takes advantage of a woman like you?'' asks Coverdale on Would I Lie To You, before adding, with a leer, ''Or is that what you want?''.\nMusically too, though, Whitesnake's bluesier fare feels both slick and stiff, a bad combination. Wine, Women An' Song and Sweet Talker take a clod-hopping rhythmic approach that's far closer to Status Quo than the much more inviting, sleazy swing of AC/DC, and there's none of the smoky, psychedelic edge that made Coverdale's work in Deep Purple so inviting.\nThere are some moments: Here I Go Again is a cheeseball Guitar Hero classic in the waiting, building from an organ opening reminiscent of Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade Of Pale into a grand, polished rocker with an addictive riff and some neat, subtle guitar melodies. It's probably worthwhile revisiting some of Coverdale's songs with Jimmy Page (see Shake My Tree), too. Ultimately though, this is one for the fans, and even they might be put off by the occasional omission: take for example Whitesnake's cover of Bobby Bland's Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City, which appears here only in its live incarnation. --Louis Pattison\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Hard Rock\nQuality: 320 kbps\nTracklist:\n\n(2008)Whitesnake - 30th Anniversary Collection 3 CD \n\nCD 1\n01 - Walkin' in the Shadow of the Blues.mp3\n02 - Sweet Talker.mp3\n03 - Would I Lie to You.mp3\n04 - Trouble.mp3\n05 - Gambler.mp3\n06 - Love Hunter.mp3\n07 - Ready an' Willing.mp3\n08 - Child of Babylon.mp3\n09 - Here I Go Again.mp3\n10 - Carry Your Load.mp3\n11 - Crying in the Rain.mp3\n12 - Rough an' Ready.mp3\n13 - Wine, Women an' Song.mp3\n14 - Lie Down....I Think I Love You.mp3\n15 - Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City (Live).mp3\n16 - Fool for Your Loving (Live).mp3\n17 - Take Me With You (Live).mp3\n\nCD 2\n01 - Fool for Your Loving.mp3\n02 - Don't Break My Heart Again.mp3\n03 - Hit an' Run.mp3\n04 - The Time Is Right for Love.mp3\n05 - Love Ain't No Stranger.mp3\n06 - Too Many Tears.mp3\n07 - Pride and Joy.mp3\n08 - Victim of Love.mp3\n09 - Judgement Day.mp3\n10 - Is This Love.mp3\n11 - Take a Look at Yourself.mp3\n12 - Straight for the Heart.mp3\n13 - Now You're Gone (US Remix).mp3\n14 - Looking for Love.mp3\n15 - Sailing Ships (Live).mp3\n16 - Soldier of Fortune (Live).mp3\n17 - Walking in the Shadow of the Blues (Live).mp3\n18 - Ready an' Willing (Live).mp3\n\nCD 3\n01 - Slow an' Easy.mp3\n02 - Shake My Tree.mp3\n03 - Guilty of Love.mp3\n04 - The Deeper the Love.mp3\n05 - Blindman.mp3\n06 - Love to Keep You Warm.mp3\n07 - Love Is Blind.mp3\n08 - Ain't Gonna Cry No More.mp3\n09 - Slave.mp3\n10 - Lonely Days, Lonely Nights.mp3\n11 - Give Me All Your Love.mp3\n12 - Till the Day I Die.mp3\n13 - Here I Go Again '87.mp3\n14 - Still of the Night.mp3\n15 - If You Want Me.mp3\n16 - Best Years.mp3\n17 - We Wish You Well.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d908c3b89053821f71b5fb2bba2b46b06e783125","amp;dn":"%282008%29+Whitesnake+-+30th+Anniversary+Collection+3+CD+%5B320+kbps%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d908c3b89053821f71b5fb2bba2b46b06e783125","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,8,195,184,144,83,130,31,113,181,251,43,186,43,70,176,110,120,49,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
