It was recorded live at the Copacabana in New York City and the Boarding House in San Francisco. Reality...What a Concept reached the Top Ten and went gold, which is more a testament to Williams&amp;#039; soaring popularity than the actual quality of the album, despite the fact it won the Grammy award for best comedy recording. Quite simply, Williams&amp;#039; maniacal, improvisational style at the time did not lend itself to cohesiveness. Williams had difficulty harnessing his own explosive brilliance, and as a result Reality...What a Concept is disjointed. The funniest tracks are &quot;Kindergarten of the Stars,&quot; &quot;Reverend Earnest Angry,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare (A Meltdowner&amp;#039;s Nightmare),&quot; and &quot;Tank You, Boyce.&quot; Williams&amp;#039; youthful exuberance and zaniness are evident, but he didn&amp;#039;t make a focused, outstanding comedy album until several years later with A Night at the Met, which also benefited from the fact that he&amp;#039;d kicked alcohol and drugs. As of early 2002, Reality...What a Concept had not yet been reissued on CD. \n \n \n1   Nicky Lenin  Williams  7:58  \n2   Pop Goes the Weasel  Williams  4:05  \n3   Kindergarten of the Stars  Williams  1:43  \n4   A Touch of Fairfax  Williams  1:03  \n5   Reverend Earnest Angry  Williams  7:37  \n6   Shakespeare (A Meltdowner&amp;#039;s Nightmare)  Williams  10:49  \n7   Tank You, Boyce  Williams  0:23  \n8   Roots People  Williams  1:50  \n9   Hollywood Casting Session  Williams  1:43  \n10  Come Inside My Mind  Williams  2:26  \n11  Grandpa Funk  Williams  4:12  \n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4686bf346ffb923afc16e61e7dd28306e7c4cbe4","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Robin+Williams+-+Reality%2C+What+A+Concept%21+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4686bf346ffb923afc16e61e7dd28306e7c4cbe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,134,191,52,111,251,146,58,252,22,230,30,125,210,131,6,231,196,203,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
