Produced in Germany during a stable period of the Weimar Republic, Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and makes use of this context to explore the social crisis between workers and owners in capitalism. The film was produced in the Babelsberg Studios by Universum Film A.G. (UFA). The most expensive silent film ever made, it cost approximately 5 million Reichsmark\n\n  Alfred Abel  ...

There have been several efforts to restore it, as well as discoveries of previously lost footage. A 2001 reconstruction of Metropolis, shown at the Berlin Film Festival, was inscribed on UNESCOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Memory of the World Register in that same year.\n\nIn 1984, a new restoration and edit of the film was made by Giorgio Moroder, a music producer who specialized in pop-rock soundtracks for motion pictures. MoroderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s version of the film introduced a new contemporary pop music soundtrack for the film. Although it restored a number of previously missing scenes and plot details from the original release (in particular, Moroder's version restores the character of Hel, who was omitted from the original release version of the film), his version of the film runs to only 80 minutes in length, although this is mainly due to the original intertitles being replaced with subtitles, and being run at 24 frames. The Moroder version of Metropolis sparked heated debate among film buffs and fans, with outspoken critics and supporters of the film falling into equal camps.\n\nThe Mororder film's release came at the same time that Queen released their video Radio Gaga, which featured footage of the film and was featured as part of the film's soundtrack. Though the Moroder version was nominated at The 1985 Razzie Awards for Worst Original Score and Worst Original Song (with Freddie Mercury), it brought the film back to the public eye.\n\nLove Kills\nWritten by Freddie Mercury and Giorgio Moroder\nPerformed by Freddie Mercury\nCourtesy of Raincloud Productions, Ltd.\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nHere's My Heart\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte\nPerformed by Pat Benatar\nCourtesy of Chrysalis Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nCage of Freedom\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte\nPerformed by Jon Anderson\nCourtesy of Columbia Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nBlood from a Stone\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte\nPerformed by Cycle V\nCourtesy of Columbia Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nThe Legend of Babel\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder\nPerformed by Giorgio Moroder\nCourtesy of Columbia Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nHere She Comes\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte\nPerformed by Bonnie Tyler\nCourtesy of Columbia Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nDestruction\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte\nPerformed by Loverboy\nCourtesy of Columbia Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nOn Your Own\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder and Billy Squier\nPerformed by Billy Squier\nCourtesy of Capitol Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nWhat's Going On\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte\nPerformed by Adam Ant\nCourtesy of Epic Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\nMachines\nWritten by Giorgio Moroder\nPerformed by Giorgio Moroder\nCourtesy of Columbia Records\n(from the 1984 re-release)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:413ea3205aba120bdc74953f580ab26a121b7cbf","amp;dn":"Fritz+Lang%5C%27s+Metropolis+%5B1984%5D+Giorgio+Moroder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"413ea3205aba120bdc74953f580ab26a121b7cbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,62,163,32,90,186,18,11,220,116,149,63,88,10,178,106,18,27,124,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
