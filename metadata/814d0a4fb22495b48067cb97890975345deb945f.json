Knocked out in just over a week, II features another round of easy-flowing material that draws from power pop and folk. While Devine and Hull wrote the debut's songs separately, II is rooted in the duo's collaborations, and harmonies are more prominent and developed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:814d0a4fb22495b48067cb97890975345deb945f","amp;dn":"Bad+Books+-+II+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"814d0a4fb22495b48067cb97890975345deb945f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,77,10,79,178,36,149,180,128,103,203,151,137,9,117,52,93,235,148,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
