A lorry hauls the prototype to an important auto show in Amsterdam, with Mr. Hulot alongside in his car and a spoiled, trendy PR exec, the young Maria, in her sports car packed with designer clothes and her fluffy dog. The lorry has every imaginable problem, delaying its arrival. A flat tire, no gas, an accident, a run-in with police, a stop at a garage, and numerous traffic jams showcase vignettes of people and their cars. Through interactions with these down-to-earth folks, Maria gradually loses her imperious conceit, becoming much more relaxed and fetching. \n\nDVDRIP\n\nMulti-language subs (may need resynch):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1291&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1291&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f3792bdfc0de563fbf07ac4e11e0aaf559958d0","amp;dn":"Jacques+Tati+-+Trafic+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f3792bdfc0de563fbf07ac4e11e0aaf559958d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,55,146,189,252,13,229,99,251,240,122,196,225,30,10,175,85,153,88,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
