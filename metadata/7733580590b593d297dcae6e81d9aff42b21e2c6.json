In his first collection of nonfiction, Chuck Palahniuk brings us into this world, and gives us a glimpse of what inspires his fiction. At the Rock Creek Lodge Testicle Festival in Missoula, Montana, average people perform public sex acts on an outdoor stage. In a mansion once occupied by The Rolling Stones, Marilyn Manson reads his own Tarot cards and talks sweetly to his beautiful actress girlfriend. Across the country, men build their own full-size castles and rocketships that will send them into space. Palahniuk himself experiments with steroids, works on an assembly line by day and as a hospice volunteer by night, and experiences the brutal murder of his father by a white supremacist. With this new direction, Chuck Palahniuk has proven he can do anything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7733580590b593d297dcae6e81d9aff42b21e2c6","amp;dn":"Stranger+Than+Fiction+-+Chuck+Palahniuk.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7733580590b593d297dcae6e81d9aff42b21e2c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,51,88,5,144,181,147,210,151,220,174,110,129,217,175,244,43,33,226,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
