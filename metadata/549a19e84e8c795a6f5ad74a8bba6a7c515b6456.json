And it was first in 1992 that they made their first public appearance on a local compilation CD. In 1993 the band records the now infamous &quot;FOREVER HEAVEN GONE&quot; demo with itsÃ‚Â´ dark &amp; brutal sound. It made some underground attention and got the band to play at the Hultsfred-festival alongside major acts like THE RAMONES and ENTOMBED. Shortly after that appearance original guitarist Robert Ãƒâ€“sterberg left the band and got replaced by Marcus Sunesson, just before the recording of the second Demo &quot;FORGET THE LIGHT&quot;:\n\nNow the band had grown into better songwriters and musicians and the result was a very brutal, intense and evil Death Metal but with a lot more feeling and melody to it, some Ã‚Â´zines wrote that it was the perfect mix between the American and the Scandinavian soundÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ This led to a deal with the new Swedish Metal label &quot;Black Sun Records&quot;. The debut CD &quot;THE BURNING&quot; featured songs from both the demos alongside some new material and was praised as being one of the strongest and most brutal albums of 1995. A video was shot for the track &quot;Of Good and Evil&quot; and the band also featured on the &quot;Slaytanic Slaughter&quot; tribute album to SLAYER with their version of &quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot;.\n\nIn 1996 the band once again entered the studio to record their second album entitled &quot;ETERNAL DEATH&quot; which shows an even more focused and breathtaking sound. ItsÃ‚Â´ unique blend of hellspawned riffing, blasting drums, beautiful melodies, ripping heavy metal solos, killer vocals and possessed lyrics in catchy arrangements makes &quot;ETERNAL DEATH&quot; a very dangerous and highly addictive album. And it also features a mindblowing version of their 1991 garage cult-classic &quot;Kill (The Priest)&quot;. A video was made for the song &quot;Angels Die.\n\nIn July 1997 the band is forced to cut their name short into just THE CROWN, due to pressures made by a Christian glam-pop outfit also called CROWN OF THORNS. The name-change however did not affect the bands musical future as they stated that they still are the same nightmare-team as before and will continue to spread hell and terror in an even more wicked way with more sinful material. One nasty little taster was &quot;The Poison&quot; featured on a compilation album from Wicked World Records, and a blasting cover of the Sepultura hymn &quot;Arise&quot; appeared on the &quot;Sepultural Feast&quot; tribute album.\n\nIn January/February of 1998 THE CROWN hit the road and raised some serious hell together with SACRILEGE featuring Tomas Lindberg(ex. AT THE GATES ). After having seen a show on this European tour a member of the Metal Blade Records-team was very impressed (even after having a beer kicked in his face by singer Johan). And after some conspiracy (with satan) the deal was done between the hellish band and the legendary metal label.\n\nAfter a busy summer playing festivals plus extremly hard extensive rehearsing and writing of new material THE CROWN was ready for the third album:\n\n&quot;HELL IS HERE&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nThe result was 11 ripping new tracks of Death, Darkness, Destruction, Revolution,Violence, Mystery, Satanism, War, Drugs, Armageddon, Sex, Black Magic and RockÃ‚Â´n Roll. To celebrate and promote this musical hell on earth THE CROWN was proud to participate on the NO MERCY TOUR part III and stormed Europe in April 99 together with the Death/Black Metal majesty of MORBID ANGEL, EMPEROR, IMPALED NAZARENE, LIMBONIC ART and PECCATUM. The tour including Wacken Open Air was a huge success with thousands and thousands of people witnessing and getting off to the sheer power of THE CROWN on stage.\n\nThe 4th album gloriously entitled &quot;DEATHRACE KING&quot; was recorded during winter 99 in the new-built Studio Fredman. The result is a top-notch superfat and modern production to really push the music like a bullet through your soul. This is Death Metal as the ultimate RockÃ‚Â´n Roll ÃƒÅ“berbeast that laughs and destroys everything in itsÃ‚Â´ way, - including you! This album sets a new standard to albums in the new millenium as it only and exclusively contains of those precious killer songs without any fillers. The recording session also featured guest vocal performances from Tomas Lindberg (ex AT THE GATES) and Mika Luttinen (IMPALED NAZARENE), to really kick it in.\n\nDuring the following year the DEATHRACE 2000 was on. 57 shows of hell-paced death throughout Scandinavia, North America, England and Europe alongside CANNIBAL CORPSE, NILE, KRISIUN, THE HAUNTED, MORBID ANGEL, ENSLAVED &amp; VOMITORY. Blasting away night after night, giving it all as if born to race.\n\nIn early 2001 singer Johan Lindstrand decides to leave after 11 years down the line and Tomas Lindberg is recruited as the new singer. After destroying some summer festivals in 2001 their 5th album &quot;CROWNED IN TERROR&quot; is recorded, to be released in March, 2002!\n\nIn April 2002 The Crown and Tomas Lindberg have parted ways due to personal differences.\n\nJohan came back for the 2 Summer Open Airs 2002: Tuska and PartySan, but the band is still searching for a permanent new singer.\n\nIn September 2002 Johan Lindstrand is back in the band as the new permanent singer.\n\nIn March 2004 The Crown quits.\n\n\nIn Dec 2009 the Reunion take place, THE CROWN 2009 is:\n* Jonas StÃƒÂ¥lhammar (GOD MACABRE, MACABRE END, ABHOTH) - Vocals\n* Marko Tervonen - Rhythm Guitar\n* Marcus Sunesson - Lead Guitar\n* Magnus Olsfelt - Bass\n* Janne SaarenpÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ - Drums\n\nDoomsday King, their long awaited follow up to Possessed 13 is released 2010.\nIn Aug 2011 Johan Lindstrand rejoined the Band.\n\nIn early 2013 longtime member Marcus Sunesson is replaced by Robin SÃƒÂ¶rqvist\n\n\n&quot;Death Is Not Dead&quot; is being recorded and is expected to hit the surface sometime late summer 2014.Wel it was late but here it is enjoy and seed.
