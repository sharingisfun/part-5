Known as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Harp TwinsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Camille and Kennerly perform internationally as a dynamic acoustic and electric rock Harp Duo. As actors, The Kitt Twins have appeared in three feature films - two of which also feature the twins performing on their harps. \n\nCamille and Kennerly's first video game, anime, movie and TV soundtrack compilation cover album explores their amazing journey across these genres using only 2 harps. Their skill as performers and arrangers is evident as they highlight the beauty and complexity of the original songs in a truly unique style. Every song was arranged and produced by Camille and Kennerly and recorded in 1 take in their living room (no splices, loops, overlays, or backtracks).\n Join Camille and Kennerly in their radical Duet Harp Revolution and be prepared for a Harp Fantasy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9dc0736d081a63fd65a5d8f1d7f16c7fb8617f5","amp;dn":"Harp+Twins+%28Camille+and+Kennerly%29+-+Harp+Fantasy+%282013%292014+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9dc0736d081a63fd65a5d8f1d7f16c7fb8617f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,220,7,54,208,129,166,63,214,90,93,143,29,127,22,199,251,134,23,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
