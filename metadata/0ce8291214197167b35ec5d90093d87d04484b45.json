Of course the scenery is accurate but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the technical part, what is far more amazing is how much this scenery Ã¢â‚¬ËœfeelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ like one of those Greek airports that have calm winters and incredibly busy summers. \n  \n  \nThere is a huge amount of small objects that prevent the rather common bleak and empty look of many airports in FS. The use of shadows and colors is spot on to give a real 3d sense the scenery. We especially love the way the airport looks at night as the detailed 3d lights add another dimension to an already stunning airport.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how scenery of medium sized airports should be in 2014\n\n\nFeatures:\nAirport &amp; City add-on for FSX and Prepar3D \nFully detailed rendition of Thessaloniki Int`l Airport (LGTS) \nHigh resolution airport ground textures \nThessaloniki city designed in full detail \nPhoto-real terrain coverage of Thessaloniki \n3D night lighting \nRealistic shadow rendition on all 3D objects and ground \nOptimized scenery for high-end performance \nRealistic custom-made terrain mesh \nFully compatible with all major Traffic add-ons \nLocal apron and road traffic fully animated by AESLite \nAES 2.34 fully covers this airport (one credit) \nScenery manager and AESLite traffic tools included \nFull manual included \nNo online activation required\n\nSystem requirements:\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator X (SP2, Acceleration Pack or Gold Edition) or Lockheed Martin Prepar3D (v1 or v2*)\nWindows XP, Windows VISTA, Windows 7, Windows 8 (Windows 7 64 bits recommended)\n3,0 GHz processor (Dual Core processor recommended)\n4 GB RAM \n3D Graphics Card with minimal 1024 MB\nDownload-Size: 1 GB\nInstallations-Size: 1.5 GB\n\n* there a few limitations with lights in Prepar3D v2, we are waiting for the planned update from Lockheed to solve those.\n\n\nDeveloper:  FSDG \n\n\n\nEnjoy, \n\nand happy landings!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce8291214197167b35ec5d90093d87d04484b45","amp;dn":"%5BFSX+-+P3DV1%26amp%3B2%29%5D+Aerosoft+Thessaloniki+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce8291214197167b35ec5d90093d87d04484b45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,232,41,18,20,25,113,103,179,94,197,217,0,147,216,125,4,72,75,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
