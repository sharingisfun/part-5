The band is managed by Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals, and is known for a string of (mainly) mid-1970s hit singles that are staples of the classic rock radio format.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Joker is the eighth album by Steve Miller Band, released in 1973. The album marked a period of significant change for the group as the band abandoned their psychedelic oriented music for a more melodic, smooth rock/blues sound. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was also their first solid commercial success due to the strong radio-play of the title track. The title track took 19 days to record. The album reached #2 on the Billboard 200 and has been certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nThe artwork of the album is also considered amongst the greatest; for example Rolling Stone would later rank it as one of the &quot;Top 100 Album Covers Of All Time&quot;.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a80ddd25f2b600a62cfc2ed2075209cf653ac0d9","amp;dn":"Steve+Miller+Band+-+The+Joker+%5B1973%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a80ddd25f2b600a62cfc2ed2075209cf653ac0d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,13,221,37,242,182,0,166,44,252,46,210,7,82,9,207,101,58,192,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
