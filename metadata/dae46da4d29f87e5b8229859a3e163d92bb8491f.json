For thousands of years, human beings have practiced refined techniques of mental focusing, designed to change the habitual conditioning of the mind. Central to many spiritual and philosophical traditions and known in English as \\&quot;meditation,\\&quot; these practices are considered a major means for enhanced awareness and self-mastery.\n\nIn recent decades, modern science has dramatically confirmed what advanced meditators have long claimedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that meditation, correctly practiced, offers deep and lasting benefits for mental functioning and emotional health, as well as for physical health and well-being.\n\nThe many practical benefits of meditation include\n\n   marked and lasting reduction of stress;\n   increased ability to focus and concentrate, as well as clarity of thinking;\n   freedom from detrimental patterns of thought and emotion;\n   increased learning capacity and memory; and\n   greatly enhanced well-being and peacefulness.\n\nIf practiced consistently, the results are real and very far-reaching. In the largest sense, meditation allows you to live in harmony with the realities of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to embrace life\\'s ever-changing impermanence, to live in equanimity with the inevitable ups and downs of being human, and to feel deeply connected to the whole of life.\n\nNow, in Practicing Mindfulness: An Introduction to Meditation, award-winning Professor Mark W. Muesse of Rhodes College takes you on a dynamic exploration of your own mind, giving you a clear and useable understanding of the essence of meditation and how to practice it.\n\nIn 24 detailed lectures, using numerous guided exercises, Professor Muesse teaches you the principles and techniques of sitting meditation, the related practice of walking meditation, and the highly beneficial use of meditative awareness in many important activities, including eating and driving. As a major strength of the course, you learn in depth how to use the skills of meditation in working with thoughts and emotional states, in deepening sensory awareness of the body, and in becoming deeply attentive to the operation of your mind. Emphasizing clarity and practical understanding, this course will leave you with a solid basis for your own meditation practice and for bringing meditation\\'s remarkable and empowering benefits to every area of your life.\n\n\\&quot;Mindfulness\\&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Eye of the Witness\n\nMeditation, as you learn it here, is closely related to the notion of \\&quot;mindfulness.\\&quot; In Professor Muesse\\'s words, \\&quot;Mindfulness is a deliberate way of paying attention to what is occurring within oneself as it is happening. It is the process of attentively observing your experience as it unfolds, without judgment or evaluation.\\&quot;\n\n\\&quot;Meditation,\\&quot; he adds, \\&quot;refers to certain exercises that can be used to enlarge and refine mindfulness.\\&quot; Meditation cultivates mindfulness by training you to develop deep attention to the present moment, allowing the mind to become settled and centered.\n\nWith the ongoing practice of meditation, you gain the ability to bring the liberating effects of mindful awareness to moment-to-moment living. Ultimately, this means developing a mind of openness and flexibility, profound physical calmness, and a deepening freedom to choose how you respond to life.\n\nThroughout the lectures of this course, you practice the principles of mindfulness through focused meditations and guided exercises, including these:\n\n   Sitting meditation: The core practice of the mindfulness tradition. You learn the specific methods of meditation with mindful awareness.\n   Body scan meditation: A second fundamental practice, bringing deep focus to the body and bodily sensations, promoting both concentration and physical relaxation.\n   Mindful engagement with thoughts: You learn four specific practices for releasing detrimental patterns of thought.\n   Metta meditation: Central to the mindfulness tradition, you learn this form of directed contemplation, focusing on the well-being of others and powerfully effective for cultivating compassion.\n   Meditations for physical pain: You practice two forms of meditation for alleviating pain and physical discomfort of all kinds.\n\nThe Insights of Meditation in Action\n\nBuilding on your practice-based understanding, Professor Muesse takes the exploration into many different areas of life, showing you in depth how meditation and mindfulness apply to daily living.\n\nEarly in the course, you practice meditative awareness in the act of eating, in an exercise vividly highlighting all five senses. This exercise uncovers a richness of experience that usually goes unexplored and illustrates one of meditation\\'s significant benefitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½being deeply present in the moments of your own life.\n\nYou study the mindfulness tradition\\'s approach to difficult emotions, using the example of anger. Here you find a way of disarming anger that builds on meditation, based in nonjudgmental attention, conscious acceptance, and the mental spaciousness to choose your response.\n\nIn the course\\'s second half, you explore how mindfulness is used both in building qualities of personal character and in facing life\\'s most challenging experiences. In individual lectures, you learn specific practices for cultivating generosity, empathy, and the beneficial use of speech, and for dealing with the inevitability of loss and grief.\n\nClarity on the Nature of Reality\n\nAs a core theme of this course, you delve into one of the most revealing and practical benefits of mindfulnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the freedom that comes with rigorous clarity about the nature of reality. Drawing on what Buddhism calls the \\&quot;three marks of existence,\\&quot;\n\n   you see how our conditioned resistance to the transience and passing away of all things causes suffering, and how mindfulness practice allows you to freely and joyfully embrace life\\'s impermanence;\n   you explore the ways in which mindful awareness gives you freedom from the \\&quot;insatiable\\&quot; quality of human experienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the tendency to endlessly pursue the outward symbols of happiness and achievement;\n   you look at the factors that determine the sense of separateness that burdens many people, and how mindfulness practice leads to a fundamental experience of connectedness to the whole.\n\nThe Power of Living Mindfully\n\nAn expert in Eastern philosophies, Professor Muesse is the rare teacher with both extensive academic credentials and decades of experience as a meditator, having studied and practiced with meditation masters in Thailand, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. He enriches your experience with compelling reflections on his own journey with mindfulness practice, filmed demonstrations of key techniques, and enthralling stories and perspectives from the great spirits of history.\n\nYou hear the Buddha\\'s penetrating counsel to a woman in the throes of grief, and Rilke\\'s passionate words on the necessity of giving joyful consent to all of life. You hear about Professor Muesse\\'s own transformative experience with the practice of generosity, and you contemplate the Zen parable of a man caught between two hungry tigers, highlighting the existential choices we all face in living rich and satisfying lives and in savoring life to the full.\n\nIn Practicing Mindfulness: An Introduction to Meditation, Professor Muesse offers you a rare and extraordinary opportunity. By grasping the essential nature of meditation and mindful awareness within the setting of specific, grounded practice, you deepen the power to shape your own mind and experience, to know a well-being that is not ruled by circumstances, and to find yourself truly and lastingly at home in the world.\n\nJoin Professor Muesse in this empowering journey of the spiritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the art of living at its most fulfilling, expansive, and meaningful.\n\nAbout Your Professor\n\nDr. Mark W.

Muesse (Biography)\n\nThe following materials are provided to enhance your learning experience. Click the links below for free information including a professor-authored course summary, recommended web links, and a condensed bibliography.\n\n   Course Summary - Professor\\'s written description of the course.\n   Professor Recommended Links\n   Condensed Bibliography - Prepared by the professor for this course.\n\nCourse Summary\n\nMindfulness is the skill of being deliberately attentive to one\\'s experience as it unfoldsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½without the superimposition of our usual commentary and conceptualizing. The capacity to be mindful provides a wholesome way to attend to our experiences and helps us overcome the unskillful habits of mind that cause us to suffer needlessly. This course is a practical guide to developing the skill of mindfulness and applying it to every aspect of daily life.\n\nThe foundational technique for cultivating mindfulness is the practice of meditation. Meditation is a form of physical and mental exercise that serves to strengthen the natural ability to bring moment-by-moment awareness to our lives. Since mindfulness is the skill of opening ourselves to reality without judgment, it is important that we approach the practice of meditation in this spirit, relinquishing preconceptions and expectations about the discipline. It is also essential to provide a spiritual and physical context conducive to meditation. Using the Five Precepts of Buddhism, we will consider the interconnections of ethical behavior with the development of mindfulness and the shaping of personal character. Then, we\\'ll study the most effective postures for sitting meditation. Beginning the actual practice of meditation starts with focusing attention on the breath and observing when the mind strays. By noticing when attention has wandered away from its focal point and then gently returning it to the breath, we gradually strengthen our capacities for concentration and awareness.\n\nPracticing mindfulness over time reveals and develops the qualities of wisdom and compassion, the twin virtues of the discipline. Wisdom means seeing clearly into the fundamental nature of reality. Through meditative practice, we can deeply recognize the eternal arising and passing away of all phenomena and see the unsatisfactory quality of ordinary human experience that derives from the illusion of the self as an entity separate from the rest of reality.\n\nPractice is the key to mindfulness. Mindfulness techniques are skills that anyone can develop and apply to the simplest aspects of living: breathing, sensing, feeling, eating, walking, speaking, and even driving. When we\\'ve covered the fundamental aspects of mindfulness practice, we\\'ll work on more challenging things: cultivating compassion for ourselves and others; developing a life of generosity; accepting our mortality; and coping with physical pain, grief, and anger. We\\'ll explore difficulties often encountered in meditation and ways of working with these impediments to strengthen concentration and to counter frustration and discouragement.\n\nCompassionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the desire to alleviate sufferingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is an essential component of our nature as human beings. Mindfulness practices such as metta meditation allow us to cultivate compassion and develop empathy for others, deeply recognizing their inner experience. Dana (sharing with others) reveals the life-giving effects of generosity on both the giver and the receiver and helps us understand our attachment to \\&quot;things.\\&quot; We\\'ll also consider the ways in which both inner experience and outward action are influenced by our use of language, reflecting on four Buddhist principles of skillful communication.\n\nFinding compassion for ourselves is more challenging for many of us, particularly the perfectionists among us; mindfulness techniques can help us embrace and accept both imperfection and perfectionism as an opening to freedom and deeper humanity. The skills of mindfulness also offer powerful means to work with physical discomfortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½through understanding the crucial distinction between pain and sufferingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as it directly affects our perceptions.\n\nReflecting on the universality of loss, we\\'ll take a deeper look at the notion of impermanence. By learning to embrace life\\'s transience and to center our focus in the present moment, we are able to experience loss and even grief without fear or aversion. In the mindfulness tradition, the practice of reflecting on death is considered to be both liberating and essential to living a full and satisfying life. We\\'ll examine the ways in which our culture conditions us to avoid and deny death, and we\\'ll learn meditations that deepen both the awareness of life\\'s transience and our ability to live freely.\n\nFinally, we\\'ll reflect on the capacity of mindfulness practice to profoundly alter our perceptions of ourselves, the world, and our place in it.\n\nProfessor Recommended Links\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://mindful.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://mindful.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.fetzer.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.fetzer.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCondensed Bibliography\n\nThese selected titles from the reading list are now available on Amazon.com.
