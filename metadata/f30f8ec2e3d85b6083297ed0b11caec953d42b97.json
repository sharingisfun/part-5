Director Walter Ruttman&amp;#039;s five-reel symphony begins at dawn and ends at midnight, showing Berliners at hard work by day and enjoying the city&amp;#039;s boisterous nightlife. Essentially a feature-length montage--one shot of pedestrians is followed by a brief clip of a cow herd--the film was heavily influenced by the earlier works of Russian filmmaker Dziga Vertov, and was itself very influential in fostering the &quot;city symphony&quot; or &quot;opus&quot; genre (excellent examples of which included Holland&amp;#039;s 1929 Rain and Sweden&amp;#039;s 1947 Stockholm: Rhythm of a City). There is also a large degree of poignancy in recording the everyday affairs of a city so far from and yet so near to the Nazi nightmare. Though many current prints of Berlin: Symphony of a Great City carry a musical track, this silent documentary creates its own music by virtue of its rhythmic editing.\n-All Movie Guide\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f30f8ec2e3d85b6083297ed0b11caec953d42b97","amp;dn":"Walter+Ruttman+-+Berlin%2C+Symphony+of+a+Great+City+%281927%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f30f8ec2e3d85b6083297ed0b11caec953d42b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,15,142,194,227,216,91,96,131,41,126,208,177,28,174,201,83,212,43,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
