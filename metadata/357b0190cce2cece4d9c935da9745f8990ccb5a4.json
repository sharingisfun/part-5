It was designed for challenges.  It does not simply want comfort.\n\nThe mind thinks it only wants comfort because it sees so many advertisements that sell comfort as the ultimate good thing.  So it tries to comfort itself.  It avoids challenge. But challenge is where the joy is. And MIND-shifting is the ultimate challenge.\n\nFOUR Ways Your Life Will Change( When You Learn to Shift Your Mind. By Steve Chandler\n\n1.  Imagine you are in a far off country where there are very few automobiles and you yourself have never driven one.\n\nWhat is a mind shift, anyway? Someone gives you a beautiful sports car with a manual shift (the best kind) and you get in to drive.  You manage to get it into first gear and you begin driving and all seems good.  But soon, as you want to go fasterÃ¢â‚¬â€but you don't know how to shiftÃ¢â‚¬â€the engine starts to whine.  Loudly.  The car shakes.  You are in dysfunction!  Why?  You don't know how to shift.\n\nThe mind is the same.  Your mind is just like that.  A gift.  A sports car.  When you can see this clearly, your life has already changed.\n\n2.  You will lose a sensation you never liked but always thought was normal.  What is that sensation?  Being at the mercy ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Being at the effect of Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Having your happiness depend on Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ This feeling of having your mood being at the mercy of others can be shifted.  The Steve Chandler audio success course will shift it temporarily while youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re listening, and then it will show you how to shift it perpetually and automatically through the magic of practice.  Practice makes what used to be hard seemingly automatic.\n\n3.  Any confusion you had about how to be a spiritual person and a prosperous person simultaneously will shift upward to encompass both concepts.  You'll even learn how the two benefit each other.\n\n4.  You'll shift money to neutral.  You can neutralize what used to scare you, and what carries a greater emotional charge than money?  That's why people are better at playing Monopoly than they are at the great game board of professional life.  Money fear.  When you shift money to neutral you can charge any fee or price you like without fear of rejection.  Because when money is neutral there can be no rejection.  You offer your dinner guest coffee and he says, &quot;No thank you,&quot; do you feel rejected?  You probably don't feel anything at all.  That's where you want to be around money.  That's where you will shift to.\n\nWhy Would I Speak So Softly and Carefully?\n\nThese 10 CDs are a true success course in that they are meant to be internalized as if you had a big exam coming up and you were determined to know everything.\n\nThese programs were created to listen to at night or when you are driving,  out on a long walk, or resting in your bed.  They were not created as a quick pump-up.  Anthony Robbins and Richard Simmons are who you want if you want that kind of adrenaline rush.\n\nThese messages are designed to sink into your thinking slowly, gently and in a way that will shift you forever.\n\nAs you listen to the thoughts I deliver, allow your mind to driftÃ¢â‚¬â€allow yourself to take a side road away from the lesson and daydream about a new solution to an old problem that has just occurred to you.\n\nBecause the programs were delivered slowly and deliberately, you can play them over and over, especially at night as you are drifting off to sleep, so that the nexus between beta brain waves and alpha can be permeated with success.\n\nWhat is success, really, but knowing how to operate your mind?  Like any other complex device, you will want to learn this process called mind-shifting very carefully and completely.  When someone is explaining a difficult function on your computer to you, don't you appreciate it when they slow their words down?\n\nSome people confuse success with being externally motivated.  Having some person or some drug, even, pump them up.  The problem with that kind of short-term stimulus is that it doesn't last and, in fact, it leaves, the user worse off in the end.\n\nThe perfect way to learn is through repetition.  Your mind is at its most open, teachable state when it's relaxed. The mind that is open will shift.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357b0190cce2cece4d9c935da9745f8990ccb5a4","amp;dn":"MINDSHIFT%3A+THE+ULTIMATE+SUCCESS+COURSE+-+Steve+Chandler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357b0190cce2cece4d9c935da9745f8990ccb5a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,123,1,144,204,226,206,206,77,156,147,93,169,116,95,137,144,204,181,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
