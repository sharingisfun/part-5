Their first hit, &quot;Tease Me&quot;, stayed in the Top 5 of the UK Singles Chart, for three months in 1993, reaching number three in July. After releasing a cover of the Isley Brothers' &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, the song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, in early 1994. The re-release of their debut album Tease Me also charted at number one on the UK Albums Chart,\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Tease Me\n[02] She Don't Let Nobody\n[03] Nuh Betta Nuh Deh\n[04] Bam Bam\n[05] Friday Evening\n[06] Let's Make It Tonight\n[07] One Nation Under A Groove\n[08] Tracy\n[09] Sunshine Day\n[10] Murder She Wrote\n[11] Roadrunner\n[12] I Wanna Be Your Man\n[13] Twist And Shout\n[14] Gal Wine\n \n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:55m:43s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 134mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I- Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200 dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Reggae\nRelease Date\t&gt; 1993\nRecord Company\t&gt; Island Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt;\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaka_Demus_&amp;_Pliers \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;[Tease Me]\n\t&gt;[She DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Let Nobody]\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63a19223fa4966d065133a098890695972041802","amp;dn":"%5B1993%5D+Tease+Me+-+Chaka+Demus+%26+Pliers+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63a19223fa4966d065133a098890695972041802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,161,146,35,250,73,102,208,101,19,58,9,136,144,105,89,114,4,24,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
