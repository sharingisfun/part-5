No area of China represents more emotional or historical importance to its people for it was in these gorges and mountains that Chinese life began. \nThe Yangtze River is China's longest river, and the third largest in the world after Nile and Amazon. More commonly known among the Chinese as the Chang Jiang, or the 'long river', the Yangtze is the lifeblood of northern China but also a large, muddy, unpredictable killer. As China constructs the world's largest and most powerful dam on the Yangtze River, scholars and scientists race to uncover and preserve artifacts that tell its story and the story of the people who have lived on its shores for over 50,000 years.\nThis documentary is about the valley's past. Offering glimpses of some of the monuments and archaeological sites that will be drowned when the dam is completed, it focuses on the race to discover more about the Baa civilisation before its ancient homeland is destroyed. \nNarrator : Jodie Foster\nWritten and Directed by Stephen Eder\nPrduced by Transatlantic Films in association with The Learning Channel 1998\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1937 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x432\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.667:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 52:14.560\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 895 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f4df6cffe8a5fc85a7adfac5b43b6ac68b4898b","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+Lost+Treasures+of+the+Yangtze+Valley+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f4df6cffe8a5fc85a7adfac5b43b6ac68b4898b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,77,246,207,254,138,95,200,90,122,223,172,91,67,182,172,104,180,137,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
