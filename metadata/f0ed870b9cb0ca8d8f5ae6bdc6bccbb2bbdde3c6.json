Chief Minister to Henry VIII, his fortunes have risen with those of Anne Boleyn, Henry?s second wife, for whose sake Henry has broken with Rome and created his own church. But Henry?s actions have forced England into dangerous isolation, and Anne has failed to do what she promised: bear a son to secure the Tudor line.\nIn Bring up the Bodies Hilary Mantel explores one of the most mystifying and frightening episodes in English history: the destruction of Anne Boleyn. This new novel is an audacious vision of Tudor England that sheds its light on the modern world.\n\nThough he battled for seven years to marry her, Henry is disenchanted with Anne Boleyn. She has failed to give him a son and her sharp intelligence and audacious will alienate his old friends and the noble families of England. When the discarded Katherine dies in exile from the court, Anne stands starkly exposed, the focus of gossip and malice.\n\nAt a word from Henry, Thomas Cromwell is ready to bring her down. Over three terrifying weeks, Anne is ensnared in a web of conspiracy, while the demure Jane Seymour stands waiting her turn for the poisoned wedding ring. But Anne and her powerful family will not yield without a ferocious struggle. Hilary Mantel's &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot; follows the dramatic trial of the queen and her suitors for adultery and treason. To defeat the Boleyns, Cromwell must ally with his natural enemies, the papist aristocracy. What price will he pay for Anne's head?\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nHilary Mantel, born 06 July 1952, is an English author who has written short stories, essays, biographies and, most famously, historical fiction.
