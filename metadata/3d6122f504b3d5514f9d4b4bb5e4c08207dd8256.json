To that end, the British present King Cetshwayo with an impossible ultimatum to provoke a war they are sure they can win easily with their rifles and artillery against native spears. However, that war proves more difficult than the arrogant British commander, Lord Chelmsford, expects as his overburdened army fruitlessly searches for the elusive enemy. However, in the shadow of a hill called Isandlwana, the overconfident British army learns to its sorrow just how badly they have underestimated the tactical skill and might of the Zulu nation.\n \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080180/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080180/&lt;/a&gt;\n \nGenre: Action | Adventure | Drama | History | War\n iMDB Rating: 6,5/10 from 3 002 users\n Director: Douglas Hickox\n Starring: Burt Lancaster, Peter OToole, Simon Ward\n \nLength: 01:52:46\n Video info: H264, 914 kbps, 25 fps\n Audio info: AAC , 153 kbps , 48000 Hz\n \nWidth : 1 280 pixels\n Height : 544 pixels\n \nSource Used: Zulu Dawn 1979 720p BluRay x264-SiNNERS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d6122f504b3d5514f9d4b4bb5e4c08207dd8256","amp;dn":"Zulu+Dawn+1979+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d6122f504b3d5514f9d4b4bb5e4c08207dd8256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,97,34,245,4,179,213,81,79,157,75,75,181,228,192,130,7,221,130,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
