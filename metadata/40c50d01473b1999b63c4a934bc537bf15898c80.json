In this lavish 1941 film version, Bette Davis takes over for Broadway's Tallulah Bankhead in the role of conniving turn-of-the-century Southern aristocrat Regina Hubbard Giddens. Regina's equally odious brothers (Charles Dingle and Carl Benton Reid) want her to lend them 75,000 dollars to help build a cotton mill. To do this, she must make peace with her long-estranged husband, Horace (Herbert Marshall) -- and failing that, she tries to arrange a wealthy marriage between her daughter, Alexandra (Teresa Wright), and her slimy nephew Leo (Dan Duryea). Horace refuses to give Regina the money, whereupon Leo is pressured by his father (Reid) to steal bonds from the family business. Regina uses this information as a means of blackmailing her brothers for a share in the new mill. In retaliation, Horace claims that he gave Leo the bonds as a loan, thereby cutting Regina out of the deal. When Horace suffers a heart attack, Regina makes no effort to give him his medicine, and he dies without revealing his willingness to loan the money to Leo. Regina is thus still able to strongarm her brothers into giving her a piece of the mill -- but the price for her evil machinations is the loss of her daughter's love and respect.\n\nRip Specs (HD-TV Rip)\n\nGeneral           : The.Little.Foxes.1941.720p.HDTV.x264.AC3.DMMD.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 4 351 Kbps\nLength            : 3.53 GiB for 1h 56mn 11s 840ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 3 881 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nAudio #1          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033836/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033836/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English or Spanish\nSubtitles: Spanish, English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40c50d01473b1999b63c4a934bc537bf15898c80","amp;dn":"The.Little.Foxes.1941.720p.HDTV.x264.AC3.DMMD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40c50d01473b1999b63c4a934bc537bf15898c80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,197,13,1,71,59,25,153,182,60,74,147,75,197,55,191,21,137,140,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
