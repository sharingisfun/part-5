Dredd is an American law enforcement officer in a violent city of the future where uniformed Judges are empowered to arrest, sentence, and execute criminals at the scene of crime. The character was created by writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra, although editor Pat Mills also deserves some credit for early development.\n\nJudge Dredd is amongst the UK's best known comic characters. So great is the character's name recognition that his name is sometimes invoked over similar issues to those explored by the comic series, such as the police state, authoritarianism, and the rule of law. Judge Dredd was named the Seventh Greatest Comic Character by the British magazine Empire. In 2011, IGN ranked him 35th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145386fdbb213208ee28fb3af6e4fc5461e06302","amp;dn":"Judge+Dredd+Collected+from+2000AD+progs+0001+-+1829+%281977+-+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145386fdbb213208ee28fb3af6e4fc5461e06302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,83,134,253,187,33,50,8,238,40,251,58,246,228,252,84,97,224,99,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
