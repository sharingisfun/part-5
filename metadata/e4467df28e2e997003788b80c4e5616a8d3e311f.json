Born in Nottingham, Bugg picked up the guitar at the age of 12, and within a year he was composing his own songs. Disinterested in the hip-hop and grime that dominated the listening habits of his peers, he turned to the classics for inspiration. Bugg's first brush with recognition came at the age of 17, when a local DJ began spinning one of the cuts he uploaded to BBC Introducing, a program that supports &quot;unsigned, undiscovered, and under-the-radar musicians.&quot; An invitation to play Glastonbury arrived shortly thereafter, and before he knew it, he was supporting acts like Lana Del Ray, Example, and Michael Kiwanuka, and had inked a deal with Mercury. His first single, &quot;Lightning Bolt,&quot; arrived in early 2012, while his eponymous debut album appeared in October of the same year and featured production work from former Snow Patrol collaborator Iain Archer. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tMercury Records\nCatalog:\t\t602537128778\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Lightning Bolt\n02.Two Fingers\n03.Taste It\n04.Seen It All\n05.Simple As This\n06.Country Song\n07.Broken\n08.Trouble Town\n09.Ballad Of Mr. Jones\n10.Slide\n11.Someone Told Me\n12.Note To Self\n13.Someplace\n14.Fire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4467df28e2e997003788b80c4e5616a8d3e311f","amp;dn":"Jake+Bugg+-+Jake+Bugg+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4467df28e2e997003788b80c4e5616a8d3e311f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,70,125,242,142,46,153,112,3,120,139,128,196,229,97,106,141,62,49,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
