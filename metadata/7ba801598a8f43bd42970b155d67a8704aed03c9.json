Jack Nightingale returns in his fifth nail-biting adventure.\n\nA killer is murdering Goths with brutal relish - skinning and butchering them. The cops aren't getting anywhere, so Jack Nightingale's nemesis, Superintendent Chalmers, asks him for help.\n\nNightingale discovers that the murdered Goths had one thing in common: a tattoo connected to a Satanic child-sacrificing cult called the Order of Nine Angels.\n\nAs Nightingale closes in on the killers, the tables are turned and he finds himself in the firing line, along with his friends and family. The Order will stop at nothing to protect their secrets; and Nightingale realises that there is nothing he can do to protect himself. Nor can he run, for the Order has connections across the world.\n\nIt leaves him with only one way to stop the carnage... and that's to take his own life...\n\nEPUB AND MOBI.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ba801598a8f43bd42970b155d67a8704aed03c9","amp;dn":"Lastnight+%28Jack+Nightingale+%235%29+By+Stephen+Leather","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ba801598a8f43bd42970b155d67a8704aed03c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,168,1,89,138,143,67,189,66,151,11,21,93,103,168,112,74,237,3,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
