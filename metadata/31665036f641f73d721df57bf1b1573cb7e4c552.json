Besides being an interesting juxtaposition of words\n (as with the singer Maynard James Keenan juxtaposition of the words merkin and caduceus in the names of his wine\n businesses, Caduceus Cellars and Merkin Vineyards), it implies an ironic translation of Soul Cleansing, as an enema \nis an anal cleanser. This translation relates to the song meaning of the song &quot;Third Eye&quot; (listed below),\n as the third eye awakens the &quot;life force&quot; or anima. It is also related to the entire album as a whole as the lyrical\n symbolism and mathematical complexity of the music require increased awareness to understand, and are very progressive,\n a term associated with evolution. Another fan theory is that it relates to Ãƒâ€ gypt, a novel recommended by the band to \nfans.\n\n=============================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01. Stinkfist\n02. Eulogy\n03. H.\n04.
