Hagen\nEnglish | 2005 | ISBN: 0131954369, 0131849379 | 554 pages | PDF + WMA | 132.8 MB\n\nReviews\nSummary: Very easy for beginners\nRating: 5\nThis book has helped my wife a lot in understanding the english grammar beside her real life english course. The audio CDs are very practical way to practice both listening and writing. I strongly recommend it for any english learning beginner. No need for any instructor.\n\nSummary: Azar is great!\nRating: 5\nThe best grammar series around! I like all the books in the series and have used them in my different levels of ESL classes in several international schools. Good for middle and high school students, as well as adults. Some can be used with younger children as well, although the content is sometimes for older students. Excellent workbooks, too!\n\nJust extract the rar archive and enjoy it... \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:699014c2a7b9a7a418eb4e5755ed9c09d34a29b6","amp;dn":"Basic+English+Grammar%2C+Third+Edition+%28with+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"699014c2a7b9a7a418eb4e5755ed9c09d34a29b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,144,20,194,167,185,167,164,24,235,78,87,85,237,156,9,211,74,41,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
