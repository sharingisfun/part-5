The years of Pissarro's life, 1830 to 1903, encompassed the great flowering in French art of the revolutionary style of the Impressionists, when not only the way of painting changed, but also the subject matter. In natural light-filled canvases the artists freshly saw the world around them, the rural landscapes, the city views, the cafe scenes. Pissarro 's particular feeling for the countryside of France and those who peopled it comes through strongly in these marvelous works. Though he had success only late in his lifetime and was often hard-pressed to support his wife and six children (some of whom the author has known), Pissarro stands as a giant of the period and comes alive in this book not only as a painter of great distinction but as a generous and devoted parent and colleague","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f3a232f8152eb4a74720ee248cea2d16fc224e2","amp;dn":"Pissarro+by+John+Rewald+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f3a232f8152eb4a74720ee248cea2d16fc224e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,58,35,47,129,82,235,74,116,114,14,226,72,206,162,209,111,194,36,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
