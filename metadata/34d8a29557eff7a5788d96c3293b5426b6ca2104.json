While vacationing in Copenhagen, KGB official Boris Kusenov, his wife \r\nand their daughter are able to defect to the west with prearranged assistance \r\nfrom the US authorities, the operation led by CIA agent Mike Nordstrom, \r\nalthough the defection is not without incident. Kusenov, whose case file at \r\nthe KGB was primarily NATO, is running away from the Soviets more than he is \r\nrunning toward western ideals, and as such is still reluctant to divulge any \r\nSoviet secrets. One of the things he does divulge to Nordstrom and the \r\nAmericans is that the Soviets are building up military force in Cuba of an \r\nunknown nature. Nordstrom knows that the US cannot effectively work on this \r\nfile because of the strained relationship between the US and Cuba that has \r\nthus far culminated with the Bay of Pigs incident. As such, Nordstrom asks \r\nhis old friend, French intelligence agent Andre Devereaux whose cover is as \r\na commercial attachÃ©, to pursue this matter on the US's behalf, albeit without \r\nit being officially on the books as a French operation. Devereaux agrees if \r\nonly because of his own intel as to Kusenov's defection, and further intel he \r\nis able to get from one of his Franco-American sources as to Cuba. It, however, \r\nplaces a strain on his marriage as it will eventually take him back to Cuba to \r\nwork with Juanita de Cordoba, the widow of a hero of the Castro-led revolution, \r\nand now a lead figure in the anti-Castro underground. Devereaux's wife, Nicole, \r\nsurmises correctly that Juanita is her husband's mistress, an accusation he \r\ndenies. Beyond being able to get the necessary information in Cuba which \r\nplaces Devereaux, Juanita and her team's lives in danger, Devereaux may have \r\nfurther problems if Kusenov is forthright in his information on a covert \r\noperation code named Topaz.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Frederick Stafford.\r\n=&gt;-Dany Robin.\r\n=&gt;-John Vernon.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Alfred Hitchcock.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Mystery : Thriller.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1969.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.86 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 871 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 22mn.\r\n=&gt;-Topaz 1969.................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/topaz/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 704.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1765 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 101 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 115 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34d8a29557eff7a5788d96c3293b5426b6ca2104","amp;dn":"Topaz+-+Alfred+Hitchcock+Thriller+1969+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34d8a29557eff7a5788d96c3293b5426b6ca2104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,216,162,149,87,239,247,165,120,141,150,195,41,59,84,38,182,202,33,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
