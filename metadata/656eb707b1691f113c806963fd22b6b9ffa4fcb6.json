Often these tales had a feminist theme or mindset. Her first novel, Sarah Canary (1991), was published to critical acclaim. The novel involves a group of people alienated by nineteenth century America experiencing a peculiar kind of first contact. One character is Chinese American, another putatively mentally ill, a third a feminist, and lastly Sarah herself. Similar to some of her other work, notably her award-winning short story &quot;What I Didn't See,&quot; Fowler's first novel, Sarah Canary, has been controversial in regards to its actual genre. Fowler states, &quot;If I tell [my readers] that I believe that Sarah Canary is in fact an extraterrestrial, they usually react with shock.&quot; Fowler meant for Sarah Canary to &quot;read like a science fiction novel to a science fiction reader&quot; and &quot;like a mainstream novel to a mainstream reader.&quot; Both novels have been incorporated with aspects of science fiction that typical readers would overlook. Fowler's intentions were to leave room for the readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own interpretation of the text.[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656eb707b1691f113c806963fd22b6b9ffa4fcb6","amp;dn":"Sarah+Canary+%28SF+Masterworks%29+-+Karen+Joy+Fowler+%28retail%29+.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656eb707b1691f113c806963fd22b6b9ffa4fcb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,110,183,7,177,105,31,17,60,128,105,99,253,34,182,185,255,164,252,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
