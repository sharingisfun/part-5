Written by three of the foremost experts in this field, the authors employ sharp and thorough analysis of the laws, allowing them to share their extensive knowledge and experience with the reader. The authors provide a unique perspective on the implications of International regulation, promoting a wider understanding of the pertinent issues impacting upon the law.\n\nThis edition features extended treatment of Genetically Modified Organisms and biotechnology as well as the implications of ethics and the environment. It also benefits from new material covering the role of the International Maritime Organization and Non-Governmental Organizations, which continue to grow in their influence over legislative provisions. These revisions ensure that not only does International Law and the Environment remain at the forefront of developments but continues to provide the most complete coverage of the growing subject of environmental law.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d7254e795ade6238068b1bd798f4630bc29a8ab","amp;dn":"International+Law+and+the+Environment%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d7254e795ade6238068b1bd798f4630bc29a8ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,114,84,231,149,173,230,35,128,104,177,189,121,143,70,48,188,41,168,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
