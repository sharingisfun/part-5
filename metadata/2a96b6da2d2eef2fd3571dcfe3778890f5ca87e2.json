He was on this earth for only thirty-four years, but he left behind several lifetimes' worth of immortal music\n\n\nMuch of that music was documented by Norman Granz, the legendary record producer and founder of Verve Records, between 1947 and late 1954, just a few months before Parker's death. These three discs contain the master takes from every studio session Parker did for Granz, including the famous Charlie Parker With Strings recordings. With an all-star supporting cast that features Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Max Roach, and many others.\n\n\nRIPPED BY XLD Version 20100424 (118.0) on MAC\nX Lossless Decoder uses the following softwares:\nFLAC version 1.2.1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/1372/charlieparker.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/1372/charlieparker.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCD 1 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/5309/cd1h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/5309/cd1h.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCD 2 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/6228/cd2j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img52.imageshack.us/img52/6228/cd2j.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCD 3 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/6388/cd3e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img153.imageshack.us/img153/6388/cd3e.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a96b6da2d2eef2fd3571dcfe3778890f5ca87e2","amp;dn":"CHARLIE+PARKER+COMPLETE+VERVE+1947-1954+%5B2003%5D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a96b6da2d2eef2fd3571dcfe3778890f5ca87e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,150,182,218,45,46,239,47,211,87,29,207,227,119,136,144,245,202,135,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
