P. Lyle culls the best of his popular &quot;The Doctor Is In&quot; question-and-answer column for the Mystery Writers of America, in which he answers medical and forensic questions from writers all over the country.\n\nA frequent advisor to published mystery writers, as well as writers for TV shows such as Law and Order, Dr. Lyle tackles subjects such as traumatic injuries, doctors and hospitals, weapons of death, poisons and drugs, police and the crime scene, the coroner and the crime lab, and more. In extremely organized and accessible detail, he answers questions spanning a wide range: Do pupils shrink or enlarge with death? Can X rays be copied? Can ingested cocaine kill? How soon do strangulation bruises appear?\n\nLively and accessible, this solid reference book is bound for every mystery writer's shelf.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nThis is an enormously entertaining collection of the best of Lyle's columns for the Mystery Writers of America newsletter, in which the doctor provides detailed and informative answers to questions regarding various aspects of medicine and forensics. Aspiring and experienced mystery writers will achieve verisimilitude, as well as the suspended disbelief of their audiences, by applying Lyle's insights, which he divides into three helpful sections: &quot;Doctors, Hospitals, Illnesses, and Injuries&quot;; &quot;Methods of Murder and Mayhem&quot;; and &quot;Tracking the Perp.&quot; Lyle's direct style (&quot;This is unlikely to work&quot;; &quot;Think James Bond&quot;) enlivens even the most obscure issue (&quot;What is Calor Mortis?&quot;), while the depth of knowledge he brings to some seemingly basic questions (&quot;How Is the Time of Death Determined?&quot;) make his answers definitive. Readers will never again see the oft-repeated crime-scene words &quot;sucking chest wound&quot; in the same way after reading Lyle on its symptoms and treatment.\nCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\nReview\n&quot;Lyle offers straightforward medical information, bound to be snapped up by savvy mystery writers everywhere.&quot;--Rocky Mountain News, 1/24/03\n\n&quot;[Lyle] takes a matter-of-fact approach to some very grisly questions.&quot;--St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 1/22/03\n\n&quot;This surprisingly funny book is for writers, readers, or anyone fascinated by medical or forensic details....The medical information is well researched yet simple enough to understand.&quot;--Library Journal, 1/1/03\n\n&quot;An essential reference work for the fiction writer: informative and fun.
