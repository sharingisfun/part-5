Biafra is perhaps best known as the former frontman of the punk rock band Dead Kennedys. Jourgensen is the founder and only continuous member of industrial metal band Ministry, of which Barker was an official member between 1988 and 2004, and Ward was also once a touring member. Over the years, several other members of Ministry played with Lard, namely Bill Rieflin, Mike Scaccia, Louis Svitek and Rey Washam.\n\nincluded in this torrent:\nThe Power of Lard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (12&quot;/CD/Cass EP) 1989 - Alternative Tentacles \nThe Last Temptation of Reid ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (LP/CD/Cass Album) 1990 - Alternative Tentacles \nPure Chewing Satisfaction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (LP/CD/Cass Album) 1997 - Alternative Tentacles \n70's Rock Must Die ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (12&quot;/CD EP) 2000 - Alternative Tentacles \n\nall files in .m4a, 128-192 kbps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e736894a8e66606a787cab5c2127944c14f77986","amp;dn":"Lard+-+4+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e736894a8e66606a787cab5c2127944c14f77986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,54,137,74,142,102,96,106,120,124,171,92,33,39,148,76,20,247,121,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
