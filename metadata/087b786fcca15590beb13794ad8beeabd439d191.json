The issues considered concern art, governance, diplomacy, commerce, court life, and urban culture in the Mongol world empire as originally presented at a 2003 symposium at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and now distilled in this volume. This collection of 23 papers by many of the main authorities in the field demonstrates both the scope and the depth of the current state of Mongol-related studies and will undoubtedly inspire and provoke further research. The text is profusely illustrated by 27 color and 110 black-and-white illustrations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087b786fcca15590beb13794ad8beeabd439d191","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+Legacy+of+Genghis+Khan+%28History+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087b786fcca15590beb13794ad8beeabd439d191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,123,120,111,204,161,85,144,190,177,55,148,173,139,238,171,212,57,209,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
