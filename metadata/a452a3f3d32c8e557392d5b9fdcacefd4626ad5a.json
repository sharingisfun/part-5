Foster's classic guideÃ¢â‚¬â€a lively and entertaining introduction to literature and literary basics, including symbols, themes, and contextsÃ¢â‚¬â€that shows you how to make your everyday reading experience more rewarding and enjoyable.\n\n While many books can be enjoyed for their basic stories, there are often deeper literary meanings interwoven in these texts. How to Read Literature Like a Professor helps us to discover those hidden truths by looking at literature with the eyesÃ¢â‚¬â€and the literary codesÃ¢â‚¬â€of the ultimate professional reader: the college professor.\n\n What does it mean when a literary hero travels along a dusty road? When he hands a drink to his companion? When he's drenched in a sudden rain shower? Ranging from major themes to literary models, narrative devices, and form, Thomas C. Foster provides us with a broad overview of literatureÃ¢â‚¬â€a world where a road leads to a quest, a shared meal may signify a communion, and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just a showerÃ¢â‚¬â€and shows us how to make our reading experience more enriching, satisfying, and fun.\n\n This revised edition includes new chapters, a new preface, and a new epilogue, and incorporates updated teaching points that Foster has developed over the past decade.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a452a3f3d32c8e557392d5b9fdcacefd4626ad5a","amp;dn":"How+to+Read+Literature+Like+a+Professor%2C+Revised+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a452a3f3d32c8e557392d5b9fdcacefd4626ad5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,82,163,243,211,44,142,85,115,146,213,185,253,202,206,253,70,38,173,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
