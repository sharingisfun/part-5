Realising they shared a love for such diverse artists as the Pixies, Bob Marley, The Jesus Lizard, MC5, HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sker DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼, and Big Black, they decided to form a band together. It was not long before they recruited drummer Robin Goodridge and bassist Dave Parsons and started writing. Dave Parsons joined Bush shortly after leaving the band Transvision Vamp. Drummers such as Sasha Gervasi, Amir, and Spencer Cobrin had all taken their go as Bush drummers before Robin Goodridge was made the permanent fit and thus completing the Bush lineup.[2]\n\nThe band found immediate success with the release of their debut album Sixteen Stone in 1994, which is certified 6ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ multi-platinum by the RIAA.[3] Bush went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over 10 million records in the United States. Despite their success in the United States, the band was less well known in their home country and enjoyed only marginal success there.[4] Bush have had numerous top ten singles on the Billboard rock charts,[5] and one #1 album for Razorblade Suitcase in 1996.[6] The band separated in 2002 but the name was revived in 2010 to support a new album, Everything Always Now, due for release in early 2011 and some live shows.\n\nThe group chose the name &quot;Bush&quot; because they used to live in Shepherd's Bush, London.\n\nIn Canada, they were once known as Bushx, because the 1970s band Bush, led by Domenic Troiano, owned the Canadian rights to the name. In April 1997, it was announced that Troiano had agreed to let them use the name Bush in Canada without the exponent x, in exchange for donating $20,000 each to the Starlight Children's Foundation and the Canadian Music Therapy Trust Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSixteen Stone 1994\n\n\nSixteen Stone is the debut album of British rock band Bush. Released in 1994 through Trauma Records, it boasted numerous successful singles and is widely regarded as the band's most popular album.\n\nOn the Billboard Music Charts (North America), Sixteen Stone peaked at #4 on the Heatseekers and Billboard 200 charts. The album spawned two Top 40 singles. After about 6 months of promotion for Sixteen Stone, the album began to sell wildly, once &quot;Comedown&quot; and &quot;Glycerine&quot; struck America. U.S. sales for Sixteen Stone finally passed the six million mark in 2010.[4] The album overall had fairly good reception, although one critic mentions that the band sounds too much like Seattle rockers Nirvana and Pearl Jam.[5] In later years Bush would distance themselves from the familiar grunge sounds with experimental releases such as The Science of Things, and Deconstructed.\n\nIn the UK, a stone is a unit of weight that equals 14 pounds. Therefore, sixteen stone means 224 pounds or about 102 kilograms. When asked why lead singer Gavin Rossdale chose the name &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; for the name of their album, he said: &quot;Once upon a time there was a lonely man... my friend, who called a phone number advertising a '21 year old Scandinavian beauty, new in town.' When she arrived, she was forty years old and sixteen stone...&quot;\n\nIn the booklet of Sixteen Stone, there is a heart and a dedication to Rupert and Julie, two of Gavin's friends who died in a boating accident along the Thames in England.\n\nThe cover insert has a picture of what looks like a bush or mop head flying through the air. This is actually Gavin's dog named Winston. A Puli, a breed of dog with dreadlock-like cords, that has been tossed in the air or is jumping. Beck used the same effect in 1996 with a Komondor, another Hungarian dog breed that has similar fur to the Puli, on his album Odelay which looks like a mop jumping a hurdle.\n\nEarly pressings of the album do not list &quot;Alien&quot; on the back cover (there is a blank space where the title should be). &quot;Monkey&quot; is also missing from the inside cover, but both songs have lyrics printed and appear on the album.\n\nSubsequent pressings also include an acoustic version of &quot;Comedown&quot; and a second CD of live tracks, &quot;Swim,&quot; &quot;Alien,&quot; &quot;Bomb,&quot; and &quot;Little Things.&quot; Rather than actually being acoustic, the bonus &quot;comedown&quot; track is actually Rossdale singing and playing guitar with more effects. This version is also slower paced, has violins added and has no drums or bass guitar.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Everything Zen&quot; - 4:38\n2.\t&quot;Swim&quot; - 4:56\n3.\t&quot;Bomb&quot; - 3:23\n4.\t&quot;Little Things&quot; - 4:24\n5.\t&quot;Comedown&quot; - 5:27\n6.\t&quot;Body&quot; - 5:43\n7.\t&quot;Machinehead&quot; - 4:16\n8.\t&quot;Testosterone&quot; - 4:20\n9.\t&quot;Monkey&quot; - 4:01\n10.\t&quot;Glycerine&quot; - 4:27\n11.\t&quot;Alien&quot; - 6:34\n12.\t&quot;X-Girlfriend&quot; - 0:45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRazorblade Suitcase 1996\n\n\nRazorblade Suitcase is the second album by the British post-grunge band Bush, released in November 1996 via Trauma Records.\n\nThe album's working title was Ghost Medicine, but was changed for unknown reasons. The title is a line from the lyrics of the song &quot;Synapse&quot;. It has a slightly darker tone than Bush's previous album, Sixteen Stone, which led to comparisons between Razorblade Suitcase and Nirvana's album In Utero, because some believed Bush sounded similar to Nirvana, and Steve Albini recorded both albums. Albini had also recorded the Pixies' breakthrough LP Surfer Rosa, and was co-art directed by Vaughan Oliver and Adrian Philpott. Vaughan Oliver had also done the artwork for Surfer Rosa. Gavin Rossdale made statements around the time of the release that he only hoped that Bush would be one day as successful as the Pixies were in England.\n\nSixteen Stone was a radio-friendly grunge rock album that sold millions of copies. Razorblade Suitcase, however, was more abrasive than the past album and as a result did not sell as well. However, Razorblade Suitcase reached the number-one spot on the Billboard 200, while Sixteen Stone peaked at the number-four spot.\n\nDespite the album selling fewer copies than Sixteen Stone in the US, it marked a commercial peak for the band in their native Britain - it reached number four on the UK Albums Chart, whilst &quot;Swallowed&quot; and &quot;Greedy Fly&quot; both peaked in the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe album is widely believed to have signaled the demise of the &quot;grunge&quot; genre, as it was one of the last widely-known albums released bearing a grunge-sound.\n\nBush released the first single from the album, &quot;Swallowed,&quot; in late 1996, and it was a big hit in America, poising the band for a successful album. &quot;Swallowed&quot; was number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart for 7 weeks, the band's longest charting number 1 single. The second single, &quot;Greedy Fly&quot;, was released after the two week long number one stay for Razorblade Suitcase in America, and reached number three. &quot;Bonedriven&quot; and &quot;Cold Contagious&quot; followed and did not make an impact on the charts. &quot;Mouth&quot; was remixed and released on the album Deconstructed and reached the Top 5 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Mouth&quot; also appeared in the movie &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot; and had a video co-starring Julie Delpy who also starred in the movie.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Personal Holloway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n2.\t&quot;Greedy Fly&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n3.\t&quot;Swallowed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n4.\t&quot;Insect Kin&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n5.\t&quot;Cold Contagious&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:01\n6.\t&quot;A Tendency to Start Fires&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n7.\t&quot;Mouth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:46\n8.\t&quot;Straight No Chaser&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n9.\t&quot;History&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n10.\t&quot;Synapse&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n11.\t&quot;Communicator&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n12.\t&quot;Bonedriven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n13.\t&quot;Distant Voices&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Science of Things 1999\n\n\nThe Science Of Things is the third studio album by British post-grunge band Bush. Released in 1999, it was the last Bush album under Trauma Records. It features many electronic influences and, while successful, sold less than its predecessors, reaching a platinum certification and #11 in the US.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Warm Machine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n2.\t&quot;Jesus Online&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n3.\t&quot;The Chemicals Between Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n4.\t&quot;English Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n5.\t&quot;Spacetravel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n6.\t&quot;40 Miles from the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n7.\t&quot;Prizefighter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:41\n8.\t&quot;The Disease of the Dancing Cats&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n9.\t&quot;Altered States&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n10.\t&quot;Dead Meat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n11.\t&quot;Letting the Cables Sleep&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n12.\t&quot;Mindchanger&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGolden State 2001\n\n\nGolden State is the fourth studio album by British post-grunge band Bush, released in 2001. Stylistically, it was seen as a return to the post-grunge that Bush became famous for in contrast to their more recent experimental work. However, it ended up being their worst-selling album to date, not even reaching the Platinum status their other albums did. This would also prove to be the last album to feature Nigel Pulsford and Dave Parsons. Bush would not release another studio album until ten years later with Everything Always Now. The liner notes of Golden State cite the album in memory of Ian Lowery, founder of The Folk Devils.\n\nTracks \n\n1.\t&quot;Solutions&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Headful of Ghosts&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;The People That We Love&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Superman&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Fugitive&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Hurricane&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Inflatable&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Reasons&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Land of the Living&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;My Engine is with You&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Out of This World&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Float&quot;  \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy some Bush :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:983e829d9c1e9ca50248bb5d0ac9ee1990ecbbfd","amp;dn":"Bush+-+Studio+Discography+1994+-+2001+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"983e829d9c1e9ca50248bb5d0ac9ee1990ecbbfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,62,130,157,156,30,156,165,2,72,187,93,10,201,238,25,144,236,187,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
