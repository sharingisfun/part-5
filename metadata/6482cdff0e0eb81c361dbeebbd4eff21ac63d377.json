One Breath is a bold and confident\n        record that begins an exciting new chapter in this uniquely talented\n        artist's career.\n\n        Produced by John Congleton in Blackbox Studios, France and mixed in\n        Dallas, Texas, USA, One Breath was written in a year and recorded over a\n        few intense weeks.\n\n        One Breath is a more personal record than its Mercury and Brit nominated\n        predecessor. Reflective and vulnerable, it strikes a balance between\n        optimism and despair, beauty and ugliness. The fiery elements of Anna's\n        debut remain, but One Breath is more instinctive and urgent, revealing a\n        wider spectrum of textures and emotion.\n\n        &quot;One Breath is the moment before you've got to open yourself up, and\n        it's about how terrifying that is. It's scary and it's thrilling. It's\n        also full of hope, because whatever has to happen hasn't happened yet.&quot;\n        - Anna Calvi\n\n\n                                Tracklisting\n\n     01.
