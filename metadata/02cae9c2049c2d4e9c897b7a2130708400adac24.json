He was the charismatic lead singer for the trailblazing rock and roll bands The Jeff Beck Group and The Faces, and as a solo artist, the author of such beloved songs as &quot;Maggie May,&quot; &quot;TonightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Night,&quot; &quot;Hot Legs,&quot; &quot;Da Ya Think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Sexy?,&quot; &quot;Young Turks,&quot; &quot;Forever Young,&quot; and &quot;You Wear It Well.&quot; Now after more than five decades in the spotlight, he is finally ready to take a candid and romping look back at his life both on and off the stage. From his humble British roots to his hell-raising years on tour with his bandmates, not forgetting his great loves (including three marriages and eight children) and decades touring the world, Rod delivers a riveting ride through one of rock's most remarkable lives.\n\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Biography | Music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02cae9c2049c2d4e9c897b7a2130708400adac24","amp;dn":"Rod+-+Rod+Stewart+%28retail%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02cae9c2049c2d4e9c897b7a2130708400adac24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,202,233,194,4,156,45,78,156,137,123,122,33,48,112,132,0,173,172,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
