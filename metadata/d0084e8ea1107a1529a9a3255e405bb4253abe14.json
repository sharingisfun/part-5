Since 1986, they have had 42 Top 30 singles and 22 Top 10 hits in the UK, including four Number Ones: &quot;West End Girls,&quot; &quot;It's a Sin,&quot; &quot;Always on My Mind,&quot; and &quot;Heart.&quot;\n\nAt the 2009 BRIT Awards, Pet Shop Boys received an award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The duo's latest album, entitled Yes, was released on 23 March 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Complete Singles Collection 1991\n\n\nDiscography: The Complete Singles Collection is an 18 track compilation by the UK electronic music group Pet Shop Boys. It was first released in 1991. The album charted at No 3 in the UK album charts.\n\nAs the name suggests, Discography is a collection of all of the hit singles by Pet Shop Boys up to that point (1991), alongside two new tracks &quot;DJ Culture&quot; and &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot;. Although all other songs on this album had appeared in some form on their previous albums, only six of the songs previously appeared on an album in their single versions.\n\nThe album contains the Pet Shop Boys cover version of U2's hit &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, which later in the song breaks into the chorus of The Four Seasons' &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You&quot;.\n\nAround the time of the release of Discography, Pet Shop Boys also released a video collection, Videography, consisting of the music videos for each of the songs on this album in a slightly different order and with the song &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot; being replaced with &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot;, which itself was not on the audio versions of the album, despite being part of a double a-side with &quot;Where the streets have no name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)&quot; (the exclusion due to the constrictions of the CD's running time).\n\nIn 2003, Pet Shop Boys released an updated single collection called PopArt, which featured the video version of &quot;Suburbia&quot; and the album mix of &quot;Heart&quot; by mistake but excluding &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot;. In addition, it featured all the Pet Shop Boys singles released after 1991 with the exception of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot;.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;West End Girls&quot; (from Please, 1986)\n2.\t&quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot; (from Please, 1986)\n3.\t&quot;Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)&quot; (from Please, 1986)\n4.\t&quot;Suburbia&quot; (from Please, 1986)\n5.\t&quot;It's a Sin&quot; (from Actually, 1987)\n6.\t&quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; (from Actually, 1987)\n7.\t&quot;Rent&quot; (from Actually, 1987)\n8.\t&quot;Always on My Mind&quot; (from Introspective, 1988 )\n9.\t&quot;Heart&quot; (from Actually, 1987)\n10.\t&quot;Domino Dancing&quot; (from Introspective, 1988 )\n11.\t&quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot; (from Introspective, 1988 )\n12.\t&quot;It's Alright&quot; (from Introspective, 1988 )\n13.\t&quot;So Hard&quot; (from Behaviour, 1990)\n14.\t&quot;Being Boring&quot; (from Behaviour, 1990)\n15.\t&quot;Where the Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)&quot;  \n16.\t&quot;Jealousy&quot; (from Behaviour, 1990)\n17.\t&quot;DJ Culture&quot; (Debut)\n18.\t&quot;Was It Worth It?&quot; (Debut)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0084e8ea1107a1529a9a3255e405bb4253abe14","amp;dn":"Pet+Shop+Boys+-+Singles+Collection+1991+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0084e8ea1107a1529a9a3255e405bb4253abe14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,8,78,142,161,16,122,21,41,169,163,37,94,64,91,180,37,58,190,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
