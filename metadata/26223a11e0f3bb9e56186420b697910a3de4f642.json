But the bandmembers were inventive, rabid rock fans who turned conventions inside out, melding punk and indie guitar rock, classic pop, surf rock, and stadium-sized riffs with singer/guitarist Black Francis' bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture; while the meaning of his lyrics may have been impenetrable, the music was direct and forceful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26223a11e0f3bb9e56186420b697910a3de4f642","amp;dn":"Pixies+-+Indie+Cindy+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26223a11e0f3bb9e56186420b697910a3de4f642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,34,58,17,224,243,187,158,86,24,100,32,182,151,145,10,61,228,246,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
