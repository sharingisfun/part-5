You no longer have to fantasize about \nbeing a goat, your dreams have finally come true! WASD to write history. \n\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as \nyou possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating \ngame, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of \ndoing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a \nbackflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn \neven more points! Or you could just give Steam Workshop a spin and create \nyour own goats, levels, missions, and more! When it comes to goats, not \neven the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and \ncrash the game. \n\nDisclaimer: Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, \nyou should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula \nhoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your \nfriends and buy a real goat.\n\nKey Features\n* You can be a goat \n* Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha\n  goat \n* Steam Workshop support - make your own goats, levels, missions, game modes,\n  and more! \n* MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is\n  hilarious and we're keeping it \n* In-game physics that spazz out all the time \n* Seriously look at that goat's neck \n* You can be a goat\n\nInstructions:\n1. Pls to unrar\n2. Very mount &amp; install\n3. Such copy crack\n4. Much play so wow\n5. Thanks doge!\n\nwow such crazy goat\n\nenjoy this great title days ahead of its official april 1st release!!\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jf0cCry.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jf0cCry.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/S9VwXc4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/S9VwXc4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kZI1K0d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kZI1K0d.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68565ff9fb98fc08193c55ad80f1b0ac280c6eee","amp;dn":"Goat.Simulator-DOGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68565ff9fb98fc08193c55ad80f1b0ac280c6eee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,86,95,249,251,152,252,8,25,60,85,173,128,241,176,172,40,12,110,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
