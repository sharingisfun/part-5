Now anyone can afford the quality\n      sound of a signature reverb in their studio.\n      \n      - Suite of 4 separate reverb units: Plate, Room, Hall, and\n        Inverse\n      - State of the art DSP based reverb algorithms\n      - 2 operational modes: Easy and Advanced\n      - 6 easy to use controls in Easy Mode \n      - More than 100 Parameters in Advanced Mode\n      - Highly customizable 8x8 Modulation Matrix per unit\n      - 4 assignable Macros per unit\n      - Full automation through host sequencer\n      \n      One of the Most Complete Reverb Suites to Hit the Market\n      \n      Classik Studio Reverb offers in a single product, a suite of 4\n      high-quality reverb plug-ins: \n      \n      - PLATE\n      - ROOM\n      - HALL\n      - INVERSE\n      \n      All are designed to give the same sound of an acclaimed\n      high-quality outboard reverb unit. With a myriad of options\n      and parameters to choose from, Classik Studio Reverb is truly\n      a complete, great sounding package that can adapt to any mix\n      situation with ease.\n      \n      A Musicality that Rivals High-End Outboard Gear for a Sound \n      that Sits Perfectly in Any Mix\n      CSR offers high-quality, musical reverb processing with the\n      flexibility previously available only in extremely expensive\n      signature hardware reverb units. It carries the quality and\n      character that top engineers have utilized for years. CSR is\n      designed to get the maximum musicality, recreate the character\n      that has made your favorite hit records, and that classic\n      sound that sits perfectly in any mix.\n      \n      Easy to Use with Advanced Editing Features, CSR is Suitable \n      for Any User from Beginner to Pro\n      CSR has been designed for ease of use with advanced editing\n      features. With the look and feel of a typical effects rack on\n      the interface, all the necessary controls are laid out for an\n      immediate great sound. All knobs and macro controls can be\n      automated through your hostÃƒâ€ s sequencer. From the beginner to\n      professional engineer, you wonÃƒâ€ t have a problem getting your\n      desired result from CSR. \n      \n      Ease of Use for the Beginning Musician\n      \n      CSR offers two modes: Easy and Advanced, coupled with more\n      than 100 parameters. Easy Mode puts the most commonly changed\n      controls on the front panel of the plug-in, making CSR an easy\n      to use and quick solution when a high-quality reverb is\n      needed. You shape the sound using only six parameters: Mix,\n      Diffusion, Reverb Time, Low Frequency Gain, High Frequency\n      Cutoff, and High Frequency Dampening; giving you full control\n      over the main character of the reverb.\n      \n      Depth and Complexity for the Professional Engineer\n      \n      In Advanced Mode, you will find an array of highly developed\n      modeling and shaping controls that are hard to find in any\n      reverb. All parameters, the Modulation Matrix, and Macro\n      Controls, can be adjusted and changed to create the reverb\n      effect that you need, tailored to the very finest detail. The\n      Modulation Matrix is an 8x8 structure; meaning that 8\n      modulation sources can manipulate 8 destinations. For example,\n      to apply an envelope to your reverb time, you can fine-tune\n      the tail for a specific reverb sound. Or, use an LFO to\n      modulate the reverb image, creating movement in the acoustic\n      space.\n      \n      A New Level of Texture and Innovative Programming Potential\n      \n      Macro controls can be created allowing complex sweeping\n      changes in Classik Studio ReverbÃƒâ€ s effects, virtually\n      transferring environments at your command. You can associate\n      up to 8 different CSR controls to a simple Macro slider,\n      therefore making morphing between different reverb settings\n      easier than ever. In both Easy and Advanced Modes, it is\n      always simple to find that perfect sound. A convenient A/B\n      comparison allows you to quickly apply modifications and\n      compare between two reverb settings in a snap.\n      \n      A Flexibility that Cannot be Found in TodayÃƒâ€ s Popular Impulse\n      \n      Reverbs, with Less Strain on Your CPU\n      While impulse reverbs have gained a lot of popularity because\n      of their particular emulation of environment reverberation,\n      they are inherently CPU-intensive. They typically lack the\n      particular musical sound and editing possibilities that famous\n      studio digital reverbs have always offered. CSR is not only\n      less demanding in your processor, but much more flexible than\n      impulse-based technologies. Now you have the ability to\n      manipulate and shape reverbs from a number of angles, giving\n      you performance that mirrors high-end studio quality.\n      \n      Compatibility and Flexibility for Any Studio\n      \n      CSR offers a reverb solution for virtually any computer-based\n      musician. VST, RTAS, and Audio Unit formats are included for\n      Mac and PC, allowing CSR to work as a plug-in with popular\n      virtual studio environments such as: Cubase, Logic, Pro Tools,\n      Digital Performer, Sonar, Ableton Live, and more.\n       \n      System Requirements\n      \n      Minimal: Pentium 1GHz / Athlon XP 1.33 GHz, 512 MB of RAM,\n      Windows XP. \n      Suggested: Pentium 2.4 GHz / Athlon XP 1.33 GHz, 1 GB of RAM,\n      Windows XP.\n      Supported Plug-in formats: VST, RTAS.\n      Classik Studio Reverb RTAS requires ProTools 7.0 or later.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7663089778a0a8739c0d14d2d624b81a396a1a2a","amp;dn":"IK.Multimedia.Classik.Studio.Reverb.VST.RTAS.v1.1.incl.KeyGen-BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7663089778a0a8739c0d14d2d624b81a396a1a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,99,8,151,120,160,168,115,156,13,20,210,214,36,184,26,57,106,26,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
