Henry Prize winner Stephen King delivers a generous collection of stories, several of them brand-new, featuring revelatory autobiographical comments on when, why, and how he came to write (or rewrite) each story.\r\n\r\nSince his first collection, Nightshift, published thirty-five years ago, Stephen King has dazzled readers with his genius as a writer of short fiction. In this new collection he assembles, for the first time, recent stories that have never been published in a book. He introduces each with a passage about its origins or his motivations for writing it.\r\n\r\nThere are thrilling connections between stories; themes of morality, the afterlife, guilt, what we would do differently if we could see into the future or correct the mistakes of the past. â€œAfterlifeâ€ is about a man who died of colon cancer and keeps reliving the same life, repeating his mistakes over and over again. Several stories feature characters at the end of life, revisiting their crimes and misdemeanors. Other stories address what happens when someone discovers that he has supernatural powersâ€”the columnist who kills people by writing their obituaries in â€œObits;â€ the old judge in â€œThe Duneâ€ who, as a boy, canoed to a deserted island and saw names written in the sand, the names of people who then died in freak accidents. In â€œMorality,â€ King looks at how a marriage and two lives fall apart after the wife and husband enter into what seems, at first, a devilâ€™s pact they can win.\r\n\r\nMagnificent, eerie, utterly compelling, these stories comprise one of Kingâ€™s finest gifts to his constant readerâ€”â€œI made them especially for you,â€ says King. â€œFeel free to examine them, but please be careful. The best of them have teeth.â€\r\n\r\nA thrilling collection of 20 stories - some brand new, some published in magazines, all entirely brilliant and collected for the first time - with a wonderful bonus: in addition to his introduction to the whole collection, King gives readers a fascinating introduction to each story with autobiographical comments on their origins and motivation.\r\n\r\nThe No. 1 best-selling writer has dazzled readers with his genius as a writer of novellas and short story fiction since his first collection was published. He describes the nature of the form in his introduction to the book: 'There's something to be said for a shorter, more intense experience. It can be invigorating, sometimes even shocking, like...a beautiful curio for sale laid out on a cheap blanket at a street bazaar.'\r\n\r\nEffervescent yet poignant, juxtaposing the everyday against the unexpected, these stories comprise one of King's finest gifts to his constant reader as well as to those fascinated by the autobiographical insights in his celebrated non-fiction title On Writing.\r\n\r\nâ€œIntroductionâ€ read by Stephen King\r\nâ€œMile 81â€ read by Thomas Sadoksi\r\nâ€œPremium Harmonyâ€ read by Will Patton\r\nâ€œBatman and Robin Have an Altercationâ€ read by Santino Fontana\r\nâ€œThe Duneâ€ read by Edward Herrmann\r\nâ€œBad Little Kidâ€ read by Dylan Baker\r\nâ€œA Deathâ€ read by Cotter Smith\r\nâ€œThe Bone Churchâ€ read by Cotter Smith\r\nâ€œMoralityâ€ read by Mare Winningham\r\nâ€œAfterlifeâ€ read by Dylan Baker\r\nâ€œUrâ€ read by Holter Graham\r\nâ€œHerman Wouk Is Still Aliveâ€ read by Brooke Bloom and Kathleen Chalfant\r\nâ€œUnder the Weatherâ€ read by Peter Friedman\r\nâ€œBlockade Billyâ€ read by Craig Wasson\r\nâ€œMister Yummyâ€ read by Peter Friedman\r\nâ€œTommyâ€ read by Stephen King\r\nâ€œThe Little Green God of Agonyâ€ read by Hope Davis\r\nâ€œThat Bus Is Another Worldâ€ read by Fred Weller\r\nâ€œObitsâ€ read by Fred Weller\r\nâ€œDrunken Fireworksâ€ read by Tim Sample\r\nâ€œSummer Thunderâ€ read by Will Patton\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Read by Stephen King, Dylan Baker, Brooke Bloom, Hope Davis, Kathleen Chalfant, Santino Fontana, Peter Friedman\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nListening Length: 19 hours and 16 minutes\r\nProgram Type: Audiobook\r\nVersion: Unabridged\r\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Audio\r\nAudible.com Release Date: November 3, 2015\r\nLanguage: English\r\nASIN: B014GCUHMI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb77791a5385fb81a5d0b9c9e3991ced55a5f07","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+The+Bazaar+of+Bad+Dreams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb77791a5385fb81a5d0b9c9e3991ced55a5f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,183,119,145,165,56,95,184,26,93,11,156,158,57,145,206,213,90,95,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
