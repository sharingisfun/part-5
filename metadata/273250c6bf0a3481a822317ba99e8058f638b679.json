Using spectacular CGI, witness the virtual construction of these mega structures and learn about the obstacles and challenges that must be overcome, and how technology is advancing today to accommodate the needs of these awe-inspiring structures of tomorrow. \nHumankind is on the verge of a new era of mind-blowing global engineering projects that make today's most ambitious constructions look like child's play. Inflating the designs of masterminds to the largest proportions, Mega Engineering supersizes a geodesic dome to cover the entire city of Houston, stretches an underwater tunnel farther than ever before to connect continents, and contemplates new solutions to turn our massive seas into floating, habitable land space.\n\n\n\n3)  City at Sea \nNew Orleans is under siege. Devastating floods caused by global warming and rising sea levels have brought the city to its knees. The old defenses - levees and canals - can't be counted on any longer. But surprisingly, some engineers are saying the only way for New Orleans to escape the water is to build a floating city: a new New Orleans buoyed by the water, not drowning under it. Long a dream for engineers, science has finally caught up with theory. Innovations in nautical design, material science, and maritime construction have made it possible. But much more remains to be done. The city will have to survive killer waves, repel pirate attacks, and dodge hurricanes. The stakes are sky high, but the Big Easy is up to the challenge.\n\n4)  Mile High Skyscraper \nShanghai faces a double crisis: overpopulation and urban sprawl. The Chinese are running out of room no matter how fast they build, so the city may implode. Under this crushing growth, Shanghai's economy, the health of its people, and the city's stability all lie in the balance. The solution could be building up, not out. And that could mean constructing the planet's tallest tower - at one mile high, it will be the world's first moving, breathing building. But to build it, engineers will have to overcome incredible obstacles and revolutionise the way we construct skyscrapers. Cable-less elevators would have to be invented, farms that grow inside buildings would be engineered, and windows that breathe and think for themselves could be created.\n\n5)  Underground City \nChicago, Illinois is home to some of the country's most iconic skyscrapers, but with downtown real estate at a premium and with commuting times among the nation's worst, some have proposed a new solution: an Underground City. By building 1,000 feet directly beneath the Loop, the city could solve its space crunch and provide homes, offices, and more to tens of thousands of people. Drawing on lessons learned in Moscow - home to the world's deepest subway system - and Amsterdam - where planners hope to build beneath the city's canals, an underground city beneath Chicago is not only technologically possible, but might one day be necessary.\n\n6)  Personal Pods \nWashington DC is a true traffic nightmare. Commuters waste 150 million hours a year in traffic, costing an estimated USD$2.5 billion in wasted fuel and lost time. City planners are out of options. Buses pollute and only add to the traffic mess. And the city can't expand its overworked Metro subway system fast enough to meet demand. But help may be on the way in the form of Personal Pods. It's a high-speed, non-stop, self-driving transit system that's been the Holy Grail for transportation engineers for half a century. An automated Personal Pod system would rewrite the rules of the road in DC, and be a model for new transportation systems worldwide.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0e/Mega-Engineering-Series-1-Screen0.jpg&quot;
