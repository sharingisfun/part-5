They see it as a qualityÃ¢â‚¬â€like creativityÃ¢â‚¬â€that has a magical, exclusive, elusive connotation.\n\nThat is simply not true, says Gina Rudan. Every one of us has a capacity for genius. Anyone is capable of achieving something so extraordinary that it could change the game for you, your business, and every aspect of your life. In Practical Genius, Rudan shows you how to:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Identify your genius\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Express it in everyday life\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Surround yourself with genius\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sustain genius for a lifetime of personal and professional satisfaction\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Market your genius to others\n\nEach stage features exercises to guide you along the way, leaving you feeling accomplished and ready for the next stage. The outcome is a profound revelation: You have the tools and ability to realize greatness both in and out of the workplace.\n\nUNLEASH YOUR GENIUS\n\nForget what you think you know about genius. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about having a Mensa I.Q. or painting the Sistine Chapel. EveryoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got genius, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you to find it, put it to work, and watch it change your life. With the help of Practical Genius, you will:\n\nIdentify your genius. Where do your passions and your talents meet? (page 23)\n\nExpress your genius. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your story, and how do you share it with others? (page 57)\n\nSurround yourself with genius. Who do you need in your tribe? (page 93)\n\nSustain your genius. How do you feed and care for your genius? (page 135)\n\nMarket your genius. Why are your contradictions actually your largest competitive advantage?
