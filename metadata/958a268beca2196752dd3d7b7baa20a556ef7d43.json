Along the way he meets a girl, records propaganda films and defeats Sammy Sosa for the 1998 regular season Home Run title.\n\nStanding in Captain AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way is the evil Red Skull, who bears a striking resemblance to the father of the kid in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Son of The Mask.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Red Skull has developed some sort of laser, which he intends to use to achieve modest goals of establishing himself as a respected political figure in a small, manageable region of, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just kidding, he intends on taking over the entire world.\n\nAiding Captain America is Tommy Lee Jones, who appears to have been 73 for the past three decades, his loyal sidekick Bucky, who weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pretty sure had some lines in the movie, and a guy named Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader &quot;Dum Dum&quot; Dugan who wears a bowler hat, ironic mustache and to re-emphasize, is named Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader &quot;Dum Dum&quot; Dugan.\n\nYou canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have an Avengers movie without several years of breathless hype and inflated expectations sure to leave fans disappointed The First Avenger, and Captain America certainly makes a case for filling that role, in that he becomes an Avenger and may even have done so before anybody else. Mike, Kevin and Bill are just happy to see Hitler get punched.\n*******************************************************************************\nAs always donate or purchase the MP3's from Rifftrax to keep these coming...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:958a268beca2196752dd3d7b7baa20a556ef7d43","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+Captain+America+First+Avenger+%5BDual+Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"958a268beca2196752dd3d7b7baa20a556ef7d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,138,38,139,236,162,25,103,82,221,61,123,123,170,32,165,86,239,125,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
