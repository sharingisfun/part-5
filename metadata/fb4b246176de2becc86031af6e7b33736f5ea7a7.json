The aesthetic of Morrison's film is inexorably intertwined with many of Michael Gordon's pieces. We watch a decomposing film reel of a soldier who meets a mysterious woman in the woods. A meditation on the random and fleeting nature of life and love, as seen through the roiling emulsion of an ancient film. Morrison's short was made through the process of reshooting decomposing black and white film, and the result is a dreamy, melting, light-drenched scene.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Light Is Calling.2004.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 133 Kbps\nLength            : 419 MiB for 8mn 12s 826ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393435/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393435/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio Language: Music Only","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb4b246176de2becc86031af6e7b33736f5ea7a7","amp;dn":"Light+Is+Calling.2004.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb4b246176de2becc86031af6e7b33736f5ea7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,75,36,97,118,222,43,236,200,96,49,175,110,123,51,115,111,94,167,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
