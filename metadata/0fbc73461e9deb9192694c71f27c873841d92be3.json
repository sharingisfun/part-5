Although still reeling from her divorce, Jenny canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but flirt when she gets emergency calls from Jeff (Greg Vaughan), a local firefighter she nicknames Ã¢â‚¬Å“CowboyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for his handsome voice. But when she gets a call that Jeff has been hurt in a fire, she is determined to finally meet him face-to-face. \n\nWith a broken leg and strict doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orders not to walk on it or climb any stairs, Jeff needs a first-floor apartment where he can recover. At the same time, Jenny is looking to rent out her guest room to earn extra income. Brought together by the unusual circumstances, Jeff soon moves in and becomes part of the family and Jenny is reluctantly falling for him. After learning from JeffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s firefighter friend Buddy (Edward Asner) how JeffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father died as a fireman in the line of duty, Jenny is reminded of how dangerous his job is and has to decide if her family can take a risk to let love in again.\n\n\nCast; \n\nAlison Sweeney ...
