Colin Morgan from the BBC series Adventures of Merlin is prominently featured as Ariel.  James Garnon as Caliban shows his extraordinary Shakespearean range in this production. \n\n   As always with these shares, it is my wish that the original dvds in PAL or NTSC be made part of libraries everywhere.  This production of the Tempest has English, French and German subtitles available in the original dvd.\n\nNotes written April 3rd, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83e23cb7ca0e330908b0e91346aab8c471ce3bbc","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+On+Screen+The+Tempest+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83e23cb7ca0e330908b0e91346aab8c471ce3bbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,226,60,183,202,14,51,9,8,176,233,19,70,170,184,196,113,206,59,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
