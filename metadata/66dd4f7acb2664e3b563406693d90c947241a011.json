Schickel pierces Eastwood's monumental reserve to reveal the anger and the shyness, the shrewdness and frankness, the humor and powerful will that have helped make him what he is today. of photos.\n\nProduct Description\n\nReview\nSchickel, a movie critic for Time magazine, surveys the life and career of Hollywood's laconic macho superstar. Eastwood's career has slowly developed: television success in Rawhide; his icon-defining role as the nameless gunslinger in Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns; movie superstardom with the Dirty Harry series; then a softening, and even some intellectual respectability, with his Oscar for directing Unforgiven. Shickel chronicles Eastwood's middle-class upbringing in Oakland, California, details a personal life that included a drive to bed many women, and recasts Eastwood from his role as the male equivalent of the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; to that of &quot;one of the great ironists of the age.&quot;\n\nFrom Booklist\nTo be a Clint Eastwood fan is to be more enamored of the independent, strong, rugged male type than the mere actor. Schickel is an Eastwood fan; he is also a film critic. And he seems to have had a heck of a time reconciling his admiration for the great, independent man with the achievements of the mere actor. Schickel repeatedly informs the reader that Eastwood is really a free spirit who has always been shy and reticent and suited to California sunshine (which must account for his slow, uneventful start in the acting business), turns often to rowdy Eastwood quotes and tough guy lines, Bogie lines, and digs up inane examples of assertiveness, such as the one about Eastwood on the Rawhide set wanting to take a camera into a cattle herd to shoot close-ups and being turned down by the director. The strong, independent male is also Schickel's chief excuse for Eastwood's promiscuity. At this early stage, the book is wearing, in spite of some interesting examples of Eastwood's outsider mentality, which led to his involvement with jazz at an early age and sheds light on his later, intimate involvement with two solid American films about jazz, Bird and Straight, No Chaser. Schickel breaks out a bit when discussing Eastwood's flicks, beginning with the transition from Rowdy in Rawhide to the Man with No Name in the spaghetti westerns and on to the Hollywood films that he directed. A reputable tribute to an average man who made it to the big time.
