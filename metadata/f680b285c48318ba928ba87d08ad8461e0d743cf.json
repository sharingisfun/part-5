Although this course won't teach you how to become a digital forensics detective, it will cover the basics of this growing (and exciting) technical field. Author Jungwoo Ryoo reviews the basics: the goals of computer forensics, the types of investigations it's used for, a forensic investigator's typical toolset, and the legal implications of this type of work. Then he'll show how to prepare for an investigation; acquire data &quot;live&quot; while the system is running, statically from a hard drive, or from a remote machine; make sure data is kept in its original state with software and hardware write blockers; analyze the data; and create a report of your findings. Jungwoo uses a combination of open-source and commercial software, so you'll be able to uncover the information you need with the tools that are in your budget.\nTopics include:\n\n    Understanding computer forensics\n    Understanding partitioning\n    Using a hex editor\n    Preparing a target drive\n    Acquiring data\n    Ensuring data integrity with hashing\n    Indexing and searching\n    Generating a report\n\nSubject:\n    Developer \nAuthor:\n    Jungwoo Ryoo \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f680b285c48318ba928ba87d08ad8461e0d743cf","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Computer+Forensics+Essential+Training%5B08-20-2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f680b285c48318ba928ba87d08ad8461e0d743cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,128,178,133,196,131,24,186,146,139,168,125,8,173,132,97,224,215,67,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
