This is a formula Steven Segal action movie and strongly deserves a 6/10 rating, maybe slightly higher. &quot;Casablanca&quot; it ain&amp;#039;t; not &quot;Godfather&quot; either.\n\nA 6/10 rating places &quot;Pistol Whipped&quot; way above most of the theatrical released disasters of the past year, certainly more intelligent than either &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; or its intellectual equal Lindsey Lohan&amp;#039;s &quot;I Know Who Killed Me.&quot;\n\nAnyway, it&amp;#039;s Segal&amp;#039;s best in several years, and in terms of suspense and tension I think it&amp;#039;s better than several of his higher-budget films made for Warner Brothers at the peak of his career. Immediately setting him up as a drunken loser, a special forces veteran now falling apart at the seams, this sets things up for a formidable challenge. Can the Old Dog get it up and smash the bad guys, or will he bend at the knees? It&amp;#039;s also a chance to see J. D. Salinger&amp;#039;s son, Matt, in one of his supporting roles as &quot;Dealer.&quot; Matt Salinger is a good actor and we see too little of him.\n\nSpend the $1.35 on a DVD rental and see this one.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n- - - Please help to give someone else the benefit of receiving this movie by re-seeding as much as you can. thanks - - -\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e39b074dad344bbcd694d19086b5a7f71f44cc56","amp;dn":"Pistol+Whipped+-+Steven+Seagal+2008.STV.DVDRip.XviD-PreVail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e39b074dad344bbcd694d19086b5a7f71f44cc56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,155,7,77,173,52,75,188,214,148,209,144,134,181,167,247,31,68,204,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
