As the second person to assume the role of Batman's sidekick,\nJason Todd had a completely different personality than the original Robin. Rash and \nprone to ignore Batman's instructions, Jason was always quick to act without regard \nto consequences. In this fatal instance, Robin ignores his mentor's warnings when he \nattempts to take on the Joker by himself and pays the ultimate price. Driven by anger\nwith Superman by his side, Batman seeks his vengeance as he looks to end the Joker's \nthreat forever.\n\nEnjoy and Please SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a4a72b9861d73ec4a9a1d1b793b96a19e10c863","amp;dn":"Batman%3A+A+Death+in+the+Family+%5BDeath+of+Jason+Todd%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a4a72b9861d73ec4a9a1d1b793b96a19e10c863","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,74,114,185,134,29,115,236,74,154,29,27,121,59,150,161,158,16,200,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
