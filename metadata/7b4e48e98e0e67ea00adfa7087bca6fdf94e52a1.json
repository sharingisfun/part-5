L. Meriam, L. G. Kraige\n\nProduct Description\nKnown for its accuracy, clarity, and applications, Meriam &amp; Kraige's Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics has provided a solid foundation of mechanics principles for more than 50 years. Now in its new Sixth Edition, the text continues to help students develop their problem-solving skills with an extensive variety of highly interesting problems related to engineering design. In the new edition, more than 40% of the homework problems are new. There are also new sample problem and more photographs that link theory to application. To help students build necessary visualization and problem-solving skills, the text strongly emphasizes drawing free-body diagrams--the most important skill needed to solve mechanics problems.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nKnown for its accuracy, clarity, and applications, Meriam &amp; KraigeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics has provided a solid foundation of mechanics principles for more than 50 years.
