She takes us from the Paleolithic period and the myths of the hunters right up to the Ã¯Â¿Â½Great Western TransformationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the last five hundred years and the discrediting of myth by science. The history of myth is the history of humanity, our stories and beliefs, our curiosity and attempts to understand the world, which link us to our ancestors and each other. Heralding a major series of retellings of international myths by authors from around the world, ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characteristically insightful and eloquent book serves as a brilliant and thought-provoking introduction to myth in the broadest senseÃ¢â‚¬â€and explains why if we dismiss it, we do so at our peril.\n\n*To celebrate my new skull, thought you might like some new brain food*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1e12710fe0e71ce4238c629b7ea1edc83aa1549","amp;dn":"A+Short+History+of+Myth+-+Karen+Armstrong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1e12710fe0e71ce4238c629b7ea1edc83aa1549","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,225,39,16,254,14,113,206,66,56,198,41,183,234,30,220,131,170,21,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
