Leaving Southampton on the 27th of May 1936 her maiden voyage to New York set a new benchmark in transatlantic travel. Designed in peacetime to link the old world with the new, she ferried movie stars, politicians and royalty across the Atlantic, luxuriously cocooned in an art-deco floating palace.\r\nThen, in 1939, she was transformed to challenge the fury of the Nazis in the battle of the Atlantic. With a wartime record to rival that of the highest-ranking general, she carried whole armies through enemy-infested seas. Hitler offered a bonus of $250,000 and the Iron Cross to any U-boat captain who could sink the Queen Mary.\r\nWhen the war was over, the Queen Mary gave passage to thousands of British war brides and children who planned a new life in the New World. The Queen Mary was a great attraction to the rich and famous celebrities of the 50s and 60s.\r\nFrom an exclusive interview with singer Johnny Mathis, we find out what it was like to perform on the rough seas of the Atlantic. The liner continued in service until 1967 and is now a floating luxury hotel and museum docked in a custom-made lagoon in Long Beach, California.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/72/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/The-Queen-Mary-Greatest-Ocean-Liner-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3306Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.46 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.42 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07d2wy4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79381ff9a1c0f75ba07044a71db4577f0cf2e961","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Queen+Mary+Greatest+Ocean+Liner+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79381ff9a1c0f75ba07044a71db4577f0cf2e961","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,56,31,249,161,192,247,91,160,112,68,167,29,180,87,127,12,242,233,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
