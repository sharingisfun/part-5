It was originally printed privately in 1920, making it one of the first personal accounts to be published. The book is a graphic account of trench warfare. It was largely devoid of editorialization when first published, but would be strongly revised several times.\n\nStorm of Steel begins with JÃƒÂ¼nger as a private entering the line with the 73rd Hanoverian Regiment in Champagne. His first taste of combat came at Les Ãƒâ€°parges in April 1915 where he was first wounded.\nAfter recuperating, he took an officer's course and achieved the rank of Ensign. He rejoined his regiment on the Arras sector. In 1916, with the Battle of the Somme underway, JÃƒÂ¼nger's regiment moved to Combles in August for the defence of the village of Guillemont. Here JÃƒÂ¼nger was fortunate to be wounded again, shortly before the final British assault which captured the village Ã¢â‚¬â€ his platoon was annihilated. In 1917 JÃƒÂ¼nger saw action during the Battle of Arras in April, the Third Battle of Ypres in July and October, and the German counter-attack during the Battle of Cambrai in November. JÃƒÂ¼nger led a company of assault troops during the final German Spring Offensive, 21 March 1918 when he was wounded again. On 23 August he suffered his most severe wound when he was shot through the chest.\nIn total, JÃƒÂ¼nger was wounded 14 times during the war, including five bullet wounds. He was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class and was the youngest ever recipient of the Pour le MÃƒÂ©rite.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:758155a09685c5a8a607a333c5fa3a0e48e93378","amp;dn":"Storm+of+Steel+-+Ernst+J%26uuml%3Bnger%28Noodles22%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"758155a09685c5a8a607a333c5fa3a0e48e93378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,129,85,160,150,133,197,168,166,7,163,51,197,250,58,14,72,233,51,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
