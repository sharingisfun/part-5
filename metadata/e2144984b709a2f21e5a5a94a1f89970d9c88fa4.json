Talking in Basil&amp;#039;s garden, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil&amp;#039;s, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry&amp;#039;s world view. Espousing a new kind of hedonism, Lord Henry suggests that the only thing worth pursuing in life is beauty, and the fulfilment of the senses. Realising that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian cries out, wishing that the portrait Basil has painted of him would age rather than himself. Dorian&amp;#039;s wish is fulfilled, subsequently plunging him into a series of debauched acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, with each sin being displayed as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of aging.\n\n\nPlease seed 1:1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2144984b709a2f21e5a5a94a1f89970d9c88fa4","amp;dn":"Oscar+Wilde+-+The+Picture+Of+Dorian+Gray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2144984b709a2f21e5a5a94a1f89970d9c88fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,20,73,132,183,9,162,242,30,90,90,148,161,248,153,112,217,200,143,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
