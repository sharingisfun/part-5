It was published by Marvel Comics under Marvel's MAX imprint for a total of 28 issues from 2001 to 2004.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist of Alias is Jessica Jones, a former costumed superhero named Jewel who left that life behind to become a private investigator. The running thread is Jessica's character development, as the layers of her past and personality are revealed to the reader while, simultaneously, she tries to come to terms with them herself.\r\n\r\nCharacters from the series moved to Bendis' subsequent series The Pulse.\r\n\r\nAlias became the basis of the first season of the Netflix series Jessica Jones, which premiered in November 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:311d8799b1a438e52383f95110d8912ef220f510","amp;dn":"Marvel+Comics+-+Alias+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"311d8799b1a438e52383f95110d8912ef220f510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,29,135,153,177,164,56,229,35,131,249,81,16,216,145,46,242,32,245,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
