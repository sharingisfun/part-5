The quintet members have included Dion Hopkins (drums), Joe Straws (bass), Trippa (guitar), Ron (keyboards), and Vaughn (lead vocals). They're popular in St. Croix, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, and the East Coast of the States, where they have gigged for a number of years. A well-received three-week South Africa engagement represents their longest trek to date. Other than the Benjamins, the members' identities are a comparative mystery: Straws (aka Big Bass) has been around for many years, but Hopkins, acclaimed for his one-drop foundation, and Trippa, for his tight backbeat skank, are relative newcomers; Vaughn has been the main songwriter, with Ron serving as the musical director. Steel Pulse, Barrington Levy, Hugh Masekela, and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips are among the artists Midnite have shared the stage with at various concerts. Their popularity extends to college campuses, including Rutgers, Temple, Johnson C. Smith, Clark-Atlanta University, and many more. Albums like Ras Mek Peace (1999), Vijan (2003), and Treasure (2011) represent their political bent and their dancehall flavor. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.
