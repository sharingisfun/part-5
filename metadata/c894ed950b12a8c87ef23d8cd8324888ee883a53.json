Naturally, the album is a guitar showcase, with each song boasting a dazzling guitar solo or two. That much was expected. What is a surprise is the musical diversity apparent throughout the album. Wylde does kick out some heavy riff-driven rockers, but he also detours into blues, country, and folk on occasion. That diversity ensures that Book of Shadows is more listenable for the average listener than most guitarist-led albums. However, Wylde's songwriting skills remain weak; although the playing is memorable, the melodies rarely are. Nevertheless, there's enough prime instrumental work here to make it a very worthwhile listen for guitar aficionados and a few of the tracks should satiate fans of straight-ahead heavy boogie rock. [Book of Shadows was reissued in 1999 with a bonus disc, containing the non-LP cuts &quot;Evil Ways,&quot; &quot;The Color Green,&quot; and &quot;Peddlers of Death.&quot;]\nTracks\n\t\t\t\t\n\n1.\tBetween Heaven and Hell\t 3:23\n2.\tSold My Soul\t  \t 4:53\n3.\tRoad Back Home\t Wylde\t 5:48\n4.\tWay Beyond Empty\t 5:25\n5.\tThrowin' It All Away\t 5:48\n6.\tWhat You're Look'n For\t 5:30\n7.\tDead as Yesterday\t 2:51\n8.\tToo Numb to Cry\t Wylde\t 2:22\n9.\tThe Things You Do\t 4:11\n10.\t1,000,000 Miles Away\t 6:30\n11.\tI Thank You Child\t 4:41\n\nPosted by Alamout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c894ed950b12a8c87ef23d8cd8324888ee883a53","amp;dn":"Zakk+Wylde+-+Book+Of+Shadows+320Kbps+by+Alamout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c894ed950b12a8c87ef23d8cd8324888ee883a53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,148,237,149,11,18,168,200,126,242,61,140,216,50,72,136,238,136,58,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
