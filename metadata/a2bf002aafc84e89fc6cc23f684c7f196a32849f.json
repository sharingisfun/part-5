Of course Demonoid would have probably had it, but nooo, fucking MPAA pushed for it to be shut down. (Come back, Demonoid! I see your trackers!)\n\nAnyway, this includes J. Michael Straczynski's entire run on Spider-Man, as well as the dreaded One More Day story line, and at the end, as a bonus, I added the explanation for One More Day, Joe Quesada's One Moment In Time.\n\nEnjoy! Hope you guys were looking for this as much as I was","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2bf002aafc84e89fc6cc23f684c7f196a32849f","amp;dn":"Amazing+Spider-Man+J.+Michael+Straczynski+run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2bf002aafc84e89fc6cc23f684c7f196a32849f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,191,0,42,175,200,78,137,252,108,194,63,104,76,127,25,106,50,132,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
