And rejection; Marcus's Rolling Stone piece on\nDylan's album Self Portrait-often called the most famous\nrecord review ever written-began with &quot;What is this shit?&quot;\nand led to his departure from the magazine for five years.\nMarcus follows not only recordings but performances, books,\nmovies, and all manner of highways and byways in which Bob\nDylan has made himself felt in our culture. Together the\ndozens of pieces collected here comprise a portrait of how,\nthroughout his career, Bob Dylan has drawn upon and\nreinvented the landscape of traditional American song, its\nmyths and choruses, heroes and villains. They are the result\nof a more than forty-year engagement between an unparalleled\nsinger and a uniquely acute listener.\n\nBob Dylan: Writings, 1968-2010\nBy: Greil Marcus\nISBN13: 9781586489199\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 972","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b5ee617e7ad163a04c87821dac80138eba2219b","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+Writings%2C+1968-2010+by+Greil+Marcus.+EPUB+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b5ee617e7ad163a04c87821dac80138eba2219b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,94,230,23,231,173,22,58,4,200,120,33,218,200,1,56,235,162,33,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
