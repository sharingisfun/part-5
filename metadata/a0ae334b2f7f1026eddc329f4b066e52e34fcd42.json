It is a story that takes him through life's journey, from single-celled organisms to sentient beings.\n\nPart 3: Endless Forms Most Beautiful\nBrian asks how, from a lifeless cosmos, it is possible that a planet can produce the more than eight million species we know of.\n\nPart 4: Size Matters\nBrian explores the physics of the size of life through some close encounters with Australia's wildlife. From swimming with great white sharks to tracking red kangaroos, he discovers that the size you are profoundly affects the life you lead and, ultimately, how long you have to enjoy it.\n\nPart 5: Home\nBrian considers what it is about our world that makes it a home for life and asks what ingredients were necessary to transform this once barren planet into the Earth we know today? He reveals that it was a rare chain of events combined with the power of life itself that have made Earth unique amongst the cosmos.\n\n\nNOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.
