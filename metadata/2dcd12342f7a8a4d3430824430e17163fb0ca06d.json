It features the original line-up of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, the first recording of the four musicians together after the firing of Osbourne in 1979. They had a couple of one-off reunions in 1985 and 1992, but never toured or recorded together.\n\nThis line-up played sporadic dates until Ronnie James Dio replaced Osbourne a second time, reforming the Heaven and Hell roster to tour following the release of the compilation album Black Sabbath: The Dio Years (2007).\n\nThis 2-CD live album was put together from the first two shows after the reunion, at the Birmingham NEC. Along with live versions of tracks such as &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;N.I.B.&quot;, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot;, it also features two new studio tracks - &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; and &quot;Psycho Man&quot;. The two new tracks on Reunion were also released on a single CD in the USA.\n\nBlack Sabbath received their first Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, for the live recording of &quot;Iron Man&quot; from this album in 2000. They went on to win the same award 13 years later, with the song &quot;God Is Dead?&quot;.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Track listing\n        1.1 Disc one\n        1.2 Disc two\n    2 Personnel\n    \n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward,  except where noted.\n\nDisc one\n\n    &quot;War Pigs&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:28   \n    &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07    \n    &quot;N.I.B.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:45    \n    &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:19    \n    &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:02   \n    &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07   \n    &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:40  \n    &quot;Into the Void&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:32  \n    &quot;Snowblind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:08\n\nDisc two\n\n    &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:36\n    &quot;Orchid/Lord of This World&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:07\n    &quot;Dirty Women&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:29\n    &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:29\n    &quot;Iron Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:21\n    &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:30\n    &quot;Paranoid&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:28\n    &quot;Psycho Man&quot; (Osbourne, Iommi) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:18\n    &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; (Osbourne, Iommi) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:10\n\nPersonnel\n\nBand members\n\n  \n  Ozzy Osbourne Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n   \n  Tony Iommi Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n  \n  Geezer Butler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n \n  Bill Ward Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums*\n\n   \n * In the credits for the two studio recordings, Bill Ward is only credited for drums on &quot;Psycho Man.&quot; &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; features a drum machine.\n\nAdditional Personal\n\n    Geoff Nicholls - keyboards, guitar\n\n\nAnd yes this applies to these old geezers, who toured in support of there album 13. \nOzzy will tour until Hell freezes. but the rest you never know so if you get a chance see em.\n My buddy saw em in the SF bay area Last yeah and tells me they still put on a decent show. \n \n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
