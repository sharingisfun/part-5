Throwing Copper is not only Live's most successful release (six-million-plus copies sold) but also the best showcase for Kowalczyk's fierce vocal prowess. From the violent &quot;Selling the Drama&quot; to the moving &quot;Lightning Crashes,&quot; this is an album of unparalleled intensity by a singer and group of rare passion. --Aidin Vaziri\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.The dam at otter creek                               [04:43]\n02.Selling the drama                                    [03:26]\n03.I alone                                              [03:51]\n04.Iris                                                 [04:00]\n05.Lightning crashes                                    [05:25]\n06.Top                                                  [02:42]\n07.All over you                                         [03:59]\n08.Shit towne                                           [03:49]\n09.T.B.D.
