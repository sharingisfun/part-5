Historian and archaeologist Neil Oliver returns to visit eight more spectacular coastlines around this vast and dramatic land. Joined by local experts, Neil and the team set out to capture the dazzling diversity around the edge of a young nation built on an ancient land: its people, their history, and its many natural wonders.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Encounter Bay \nIn this week's journey, Neil takes to the air on an RAAF training mission to seek and destroy submarine invaders. Palaeontologist and explorer Professor Tim Flannery has a close encounter with history as he uncovers an unlikely meeting between two French and English navigators at Encounter Bay. Landscape architect Brendan Moar visits the moody Coorong to remember the ground-breaking Australian film Storm Boy. Neil investigates the quest to preserve Adelaide's mother-ship, freshly saved from Scottish ruin. Marine ecologist Professor Emma Johnston dives deep into the stunning underwater caverns of the Limestone Coast. In Robe, historian Dr Alice Garner gets a taste of how Victoria's gold rush was the making of this coastal town across the border, and Neil examines new archaeological evidence of a wild fur trade that sprung up on remote Kangaroo Island, and its lasting impact on the endangered sea lions of Seal Bay.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2b63424c436b671f051a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3013 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/sVBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 50mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.10 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baaf85c8549b51756d2f648c788082fde977b8c6","amp;dn":"Coast.Australia.Series.2.2of8.Encounter.Bay.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baaf85c8549b51756d2f648c788082fde977b8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,175,133,200,84,155,81,117,109,47,100,140,120,128,130,253,233,119,184,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
