Set in the London of AD 2540 (632 A.F. in the book), the novel anticipates developments in reproductive technology and sleep-learning that combine to change society. The future society is an embodiment of the ideals that form the basis of futurism. Huxley answered this book with a reassessment in an essay, Brave New World Revisited (1958), and with his final work, a novel titled Island (1962).\n\nIn 1999, the Modern Library ranked Brave New World fifth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.\n\nAnton Lesser reads from Aldous Huxley's classic 1932 tale about cloning, consumerism and chemical abandon; a vision of a world in which happiness is controlled by science.
