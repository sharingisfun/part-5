Kat is an outspoken, independent feminist. Bianca is a social butterfly who wants nothing more to be popular, even if it means bowing to the whims of people like the demanding, Chastity Church. The series highlights the Stratford sisters as they experience the highs and lows of high schools, deal with their overprotective father and find love. In Bianca's case this is her friend Cameron who has a huge crush on her, while Kat finds herself in an interesting relationship with school bad boy Patrick Verona.\n\nINFO-EPISODES ETC...\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2be41af5d4e92149537a722e35cf9d8a07ccbba3","amp;dn":"10+Things+I+Hate+About+You+Season+1+HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2be41af5d4e92149537a722e35cf9d8a07ccbba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,228,26,245,212,233,33,73,83,122,114,46,53,207,157,138,7,204,187,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
