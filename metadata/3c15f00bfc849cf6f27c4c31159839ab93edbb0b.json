With its church bell synths and Kevin Patterson's brooding vocals, &quot;(Feels Like) Heaven&quot; is an ?80s new wave classic. Often mistaken for a love song, &quot;(Feels Like) Heaven&quot; is about the exhilaration following the disintegration of a painful, loveless relationship. The lyrics seethe with corrosive angst: &quot;Twist the bones until they snap/ I scream but no one knows.&quot; Like Joy Division's &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;, &quot;(Feels Like) Heaven&quot; deceptively buries its anguish beneath toe-tapping keyboards. However, one song cannot carry the weight of an entire LP; fortunately, Fiction Factory were talented enough to craft worthy successors. The light funk of &quot;Heart &amp; Mind&quot; is derivative yet catchy, recalling Heaven 17.  &quot;Throw the Warped Wheel Out is a vastly underrated album, disappointing only record buyers who want every track to sound like &quot;(Feels Like) Heaven&quot;. The slow groove of &quot;The Hanging Gardens&quot; or the brisk, soulful melodies of &quot;All or Nothing&quot; may not have the instant appeal of &quot;(Feels Like) Heaven&quot;, but repeated spins uncover the finger-snapping hooks within. Those who feel that Fiction Factory's artistry peaked with &quot;(Feels Like) Heaven&quot; should immediately listen to the mercilessly hummable &quot;The First Step&quot;. Resistance is futile. \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 (Feels Like) Heaven 3:32 \n02 Heart &amp; Mind 3:07 \n03 Panic 4:22 \n04 The Hanging Gardens 4:35 \n05 All or Nothing 3:48 \n06 Rise and Fall 4:16\n07 Hit the Mark 4:18 \n08 Ghost of Love 3:36\n09 Tales of Tears 3:38 \n10 The First Step 4:56 \n11 The Warped Wheel 4:18 \n12 I Who Know You 4:38\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c15f00bfc849cf6f27c4c31159839ab93edbb0b","amp;dn":"Fiction+Factory+-+Throw+the+Warped+Wheel+Out+%5BNew+Wave+1984%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c15f00bfc849cf6f27c4c31159839ab93edbb0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,21,240,11,252,132,156,246,242,124,76,49,21,152,57,171,147,237,187,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
