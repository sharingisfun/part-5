But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a skill harder to master.\n\nQuick Points:\n\n    2D, Top Down for optimal tactical analysis\n    Real Time With Free Pause\n    No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n    Realistic but action packed\n    Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n    Mission editor and modability\n    Unlimited gameplay via mission generator and level editor\n    Single Player (but MP might come later)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71a1a526cb7325535358b832fa40befdb47b84e3","amp;dn":"Door+Kickers+v1.0.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71a1a526cb7325535358b832fa40befdb47b84e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,161,165,38,203,115,37,83,83,88,184,50,250,64,190,253,180,123,132,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
