Over the course of 12 days, our 'recruits' are pushed beyond their physical and mental limits by battle-hardened veterans from the world's toughest Special Forces, from the Navy Seals to the British SAS.\r\nBased on the special forces' selection methods, every 48 hours the recruits are put through a set of challenges, each one designed to break them down and every one more difficult than the last. In the end there can only be one winner of Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  US Navy Seals \r\nIn this first episode, the 29 recruits meet Ray and Woodie, two former members of the US Navy Seals, who are about to put them through a beasting or 'breakout' - four hours of PT amidst continuous cold water hosing. And that's just the start. And so begins two days of hell at the hands of our battle-hardened Navy Seals. Who of our 29 recruits will survive and who will be sent home?\r\n\r\n2)  Israeli Yamam \r\n29 started, now 22 remain. Episode two sees recruits under the command of former Israeli Yamam operative Itay Gil. He is looking for strong leadership under extreme pressure. Brutal challenges result in hospitalisation and failure. Recruits get up close and personal with Israeli self defence system Krav Maga, strive to remove a Land Rover from a mud pit with their bare hands and are pushed beyond their physical limits in a punishing weight bearing race.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1b/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4e/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Special-Forces-Ultimate-Hell-Week-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3006 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b069ccw0\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Special%20Forces%3A%20Series%201","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffd63fdc89fd312db025bd1062f70afe92e06d0","amp;dn":"BBC+Special+Forces+Ultimate+Hell+Week+2of6+Israeli+Yamam+720p+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffd63fdc89fd312db025bd1062f70afe92e06d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,253,99,253,200,159,211,18,219,2,91,209,6,47,112,175,233,46,6,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
