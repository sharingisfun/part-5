The game first appeared on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, then was ported by TOSE with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance.\n\nThe game's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki ItÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. Released to critical acclaim, the game is regarded as a landmark of the series and of the role-playing genre.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI has more battle customization options than its predecessors and has the largest playable cast in the Final Fantasy series to date, excluding spin-off titles. It remains widely praised for its storyline and characters.\n\nIn 2005, multimedia news website IGN ranked Final Fantasy VI 56th on their list of the 100 greatest games, as the second highest ranked Final Fantasy title on the list after Final Fantasy IV.\n\nDeveloper(s) \n\nSquare\nTOSE (PS1, GBA)\n\n\nPublisher(s)\n\nSuper NES:\nJP Square\nNA Square\n\nPlayStation:\nJP Square\nNA Square Electronic Arts\nEU Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nGame Boy Advance:\nJP Square Enix\nNA Nintendo\nEU Nintendo\n\n\nDesigner(s) \nHironobu Sakaguchi\nYoshinori Kitase\nHiroyuki ItÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½\n\n\nWriter(s)\n\nYoshinori Kitase\n\n\nArtist(s)\n\nYoshitaka Amano\nTetsuya Nomura\n\n\nComposer(s)\n\nNobuo Uematsu\n\n\nSeries\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\n\nPlatform(s)\nSuper Nintendo Entertainment System,\nPlayStation,\nGame Boy Advance\n\n\nRelease date(s)\n\nSuper NES:\nJP April 2, 1994\nNA October 11, 1994\n\nPlayStation:\n\nJP March 11, 1999\nNA September 30, 1999\nEU March 1, 2002\n\nGame Boy Advance:\nJP November 30, 2006\nNA February 5, 2007\nEU June 29, 2007\n\n\nGenre(s)\n\nConsole role-playing game\n\n\nMode(s)\n\nSingle-player, multiplayer\n\n\nRating(s)\n\nPlayStation:\nELSPA: 11+\nESRB: T (Teen)\nOFLC: M15+\nUSK: 12+\n\nGame Boy Advance:\nCERO: A (all ages)\nESRB: E10+ (Everyone 10 and older)\nPEGI: 12+\n\n\nMedia \t\n\n24 megabit cartridge (SNES)\n1 CD-ROM (PlayStation)\n64 megabit cartridge (GBA)\nInput methods \tGamepad\n\nIdeal to play on PC using emulator (possible using files directly for HD).
