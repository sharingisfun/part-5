For almost 50 years, Sophocles was the most-fÃƒÂªted playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia.\n\nHis most famous tragedies feature Oedipus and Antigone: they are generally known as the Theban plays, although each play was actually a part of a different tetralogy, the other members of which are now lost.  Sophocles influenced the development of the drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot.  He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* ANTIGONE (Oxford University Press, 2003).
