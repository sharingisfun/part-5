Steely Dan never subscribed to that aesthetic. As the vehicle for the songwriting of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, Steely Dan defied all rock &amp; roll conventions. Becker and Fagen never truly enjoyed rock -- with their ironic humor and cryptic lyrics, their eclectic body of work shows some debt to Bob Dylan -- preferring jazz, traditional pop, blues, and R&amp;B. Steely Dan created a sophisticated, distinctive sound with accessible melodic hooks, complex harmonies and time signatures, and a devotion to the recording studio. With producer Gary Katz, Becker and Fagen gradually changed Steely Dan from a performing band to a studio project, hiring professional musicians to record their compositions. Though the band didn't perform live after 1974, Steely Dan's popularity continued to grow throughout the decade, as their albums became critical favorites and their singles became staples of AOR and pop radio stations. Even after the group disbanded in the early '80s, their records retained a cult following, as proven by the massive success of their unlikely return to the stage in the early '90s. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\n01.FM\n02.Black Friday\n03.Babylon Sisters\n04.Deacon Blues\n05.Bodhisattva\n06.Hey Nineteen\n07.Do It Again\n08.Peg\n09.Rikki Don't Lose That Number\n10.Reeling In The Years\n11.East St. Louis Toodle-Oo\n12.Kid Charlemagne\n13.My Old School\n14.Bad Sneakers\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e57810e8f98b5eec57ae13ccc066b27781d2efb","amp;dn":"Steely+Dan+-+A+Decade+Of+%281985%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e57810e8f98b5eec57ae13ccc066b27781d2efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,87,129,14,143,152,181,238,197,122,225,60,204,6,107,39,120,29,46,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
