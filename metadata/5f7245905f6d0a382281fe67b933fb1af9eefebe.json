It was issued only in the United States, Canada and, in the 1970s, Japan. The album is remembered primarily for the controversy surrounding its original cover image, the &quot;butcher cover&quot; featuring the band dressed in white smocks and covered with decapitated baby dolls and pieces of meat. The album's title is based on the song &quot;Yesterday.&quot; Early album cover proofs show the word &quot;Yesterday&quot; in quotes. Yesterday...and Today received its first release on compact disc in 2014, individually and included in the Beatles boxed set titled The U.S. Albums. The album was assembled by the same team that produced the 2009 Beatles remasters and from the same tapes except where there were unique mixes prepared for Capitol. The duophonic mixes of three tracks issued by Capitol on the original 1966 release were replaced by true stereo mixes from the 2009 UK remasters. The artwork replicates the original &quot;butcher&quot; cover.\n\nTrack Listing [US - REMASTER] [320k MP3]\n\nMONO &amp; STEREO - REMASTERS\n\n    &quot;Drive My Car&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:25\n    &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:58\n    &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:40\n    &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:14\n    &quot;Yesterday&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:04\n    &quot;Act Naturally&quot; (MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â€œRussell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:27\n    &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:02\n    &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; (George Harrison) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:19\n    &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:10\n    &quot;What Goes On&quot; (LennonÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â€œRichard Starkey) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:44\n    &quot;Day Tripper&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:47\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f7245905f6d0a382281fe67b933fb1af9eefebe","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Yesterday+And+Today+%5BUS+-+REMASTER%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f7245905f6d0a382281fe67b933fb1af9eefebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,114,69,144,95,109,10,56,34,129,254,103,185,51,251,26,249,238,254,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
