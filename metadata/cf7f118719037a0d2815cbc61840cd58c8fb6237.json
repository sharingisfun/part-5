In many ways, the double album was a recap of all the styles and sounds that made John a star. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is all over the map, beginning with the prog rock epic &amp;quot;Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)&amp;quot; and immediately careening into the balladry of &amp;quot;Candle in the Wind.&amp;quot; For the rest of the album, John leaps between popcraft (&amp;quot;Bennie and the Jets&amp;quot;), ballads (&amp;quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&amp;quot;), hard rock (&amp;quot;Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting&amp;quot;), novelties (&amp;quot;Jamaica Jerk-Off&amp;quot;), Bernie Taupin's literary pretensions (&amp;quot;The Ballad of Danny Bailey&amp;quot;), and everything in between. Though its diversity is impressive, the album doesn't hold together very well. Even so, its individual moments are spectacular and the glitzy, crowd-pleasing showmanship that fuels the album pretty much defines what made Elton John a superstar in the early '70s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7f118719037a0d2815cbc61840cd58c8fb6237","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Goodbye+Yellow+Brick+Road+%281973+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7f118719037a0d2815cbc61840cd58c8fb6237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,127,17,135,25,3,122,13,40,21,203,198,24,64,205,88,200,251,98,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
