Just load the game again and hope your oponent will drive better :) On some of the races you will have nitro. If you want to start the racing missions from the beginning again put the files from folder &quot;BACKUP MISSIONS&quot; in &quot;cleo&quot; folder. (Optional)-you can use the savegame from folder &quot;Bonus&quot; and put it in &quot;My DocumentsGTA San Andreas User Files&quot; (next to gta_sa.set).
