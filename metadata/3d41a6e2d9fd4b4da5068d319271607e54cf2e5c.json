There are targets to hit but instead of having to call angry people at 7:45 in the evening when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to watch Coronation Street, you can just hire some poor sucker to do it for you. And then another, and another. And then a janitor to clean up all the mess they made. And then an IT guy to fix the computers they broke. And then another janitor to clean up after the IT guy. And it goes on and on, and in the end youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll wish you were phoning angry people at 7:45 because it turns out balancing the books and making sure all the targets get hit is harder than it seemed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d41a6e2d9fd4b4da5068d319271607e54cf2e5c","amp;dn":"Smooth+Operators%3A+Call+Center+Chaos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d41a6e2d9fd4b4da5068d319271607e54cf2e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,65,166,226,217,253,75,77,165,6,141,49,146,113,96,126,84,207,46,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
