He wants a smaller America, a poorer America, an America unable to exert its will, an America happy to be one power among many, an America in decline so that other nations might riseÃ¢â‚¬â€all in the name of global fairness. To Obama, the hated Ã¢â‚¬Å“one percentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just wealthy Americas; it is America itself. In ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view, America needs to be taken down a notch.\n\nThat is the startling conclusion of bestselling author Dinesh DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Souza in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s America. Building on his previous New York Times bestseller The Roots of ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RageÃ¢â‚¬â€which Newt Gingrich called Ã¢â‚¬Å“StunningÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the most profound insight I have read in the last six yearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Souza shows how ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goal to downsize America is in plain sight but ignored by everyone.\n\nDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Souza lays out what Obama plans to do in a second administrationÃ¢â‚¬â€a makeover of America so drastic that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“shining city on a hillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will become a shantytown in a rather dangerous global village. Arresting in its presentation and sobering in its conclusions, ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s America is essential reading for those who want to change AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s course before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3509d8011b3b0b77914e7c878c2a795a0127786","amp;dn":"Obama%27s+America+-+Dinesh+D%27Souza","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3509d8011b3b0b77914e7c878c2a795a0127786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,80,157,128,17,179,176,183,121,20,231,200,120,194,167,149,160,18,119,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
