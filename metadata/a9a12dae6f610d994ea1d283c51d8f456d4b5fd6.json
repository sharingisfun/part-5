However, guitarist Nguyen Le has used the freedom of home recording to make an album that's relaxed, flowing and uncliched. Where his recent albums have used regulation rhythm sections, Homescape is based upon improvised duos with either trumpeter Paolo Fresu or oud player/ vocalist Dhafer Youssef, usually backed by simple, loops and samples. Le's post-production (all at home, too) has then crafted these performances into a piquant series of moving and thrilling world-jazz tracks.\n\nLe gives plenty of space to his collaborators, but resists the temptation to be too self-effacing; this rhythmic electroacoustic melange is a sympathetic setting for his guitar solos, too. Fresu's trumpet playing is fleet and crisp, while Youssef's resonant oud-playing provides a great foil to Le's distinctive electric guitar parts, which evoke lands both further east and west. Youssef also delivers some passionate, wordless vocal parts, the one on Byzance taken from the recording of a live gig in Glasgow.\n-- The Guardian\n\nFrench Vietnamese guitarist Nguyen Le who never fails to impress with his new music, successfully mixing jazz and world music elements.\n-- Abstract Logic\n\nNguyen Le is a masterful, inventive player who has cultivated a wholly unique voice on the instrument. He ranks right up there with Bill Frisell, John Scofield, Mike Stern, and Allan Holdsworth in the post-Hendrix world of jazz guitar.\n-- JazzFM.com (UK)\n\nIn the main sunny and joyful, though not without some darker and more abrasive moments, the fifteen tracksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½average length three minutes, a handful six or sevenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½resemble a series of round-the-world postcards sent by Le, who mixed and post-produced everything solo, to his collaborators. As a soundtrack to an evening communing with the big bamboo, the exotic and the very exotic drifting in and out of the mix, it's rich, colourful and beguiling.\n-- AllAboutJazz\n\nNguyen Le ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric, acoustic, fretless, synthesizer, e-bow, Vietnamese guitars, computer programming &amp; electronics.\nPaolo Fresu ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet, fluegelhorn &amp; electronics.\nDhafer Youssef ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ oud, vocals &amp; electronics.\n\nTracks\n01- Stranieri (Paolo Fresu - Nguyen Le)\n02- Byzance (Dhafer Youssef - Nguyen Le)\n03- Muqqam (Dhafer Youssef)\n04- Mali Iwa (Nguyen Le)\n05- Zafaran (Dhafer Youssef - Nguyen Le)\n06- Domus de Janas (Paolo Fresu - Nguyen Le)\n07- Kithara (Dhafer Youssef)\n08- Chelsea Bridge (Billy Strayhorn)\n09- Safina (Dhafer Youssef - Nguyen Le)\n10- Des Pres (Paolo Fresu - Nguyen Le)\n11- Thang Long (Nguyen Le)\n12- Neon (Paolo Fresu - Nguyen Le)\n13- Mangustao (Dominique Borker)\n14- Lacrima Christi (Paolo Fresu - Nguyen Le)\n15- Beyti (Dhafer Youssef - Nguyen Le)\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9a12dae6f610d994ea1d283c51d8f456d4b5fd6","amp;dn":"Nguyen+Le%2C+Paolo+Fresu%2C+Dhafer+Youssef+-+Homescape+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9a12dae6f610d994ea1d283c51d8f456d4b5fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,161,45,174,111,97,13,153,78,161,210,131,197,29,143,69,109,75,95,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
