Although Zeppelin was known as the king of heavy metal, their music was actually subtle and textured, which makes it perfect for these lush, grandiose orchestral arrangements. Weirdly enough, these symphonic arrangements emphasize the compositional skills of Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Robert Plant, and John Bonham, since these replicate the dense arrangements of Zep records, only with symphonic instruments. Certainly hard-line rock and classical fans will object to the very idea behind Kashmir: Symphonic Led Zeppelin, but it's a surprising, even rousing, success with very little camp value at all.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Dawn At The Great Pyramid\n02.Kashmir\n03.The Battle Of Evermore\n04.Stairway To Heaven\n05.When The Levee Breaks\n06.Going To California\n07.Friends\n08.All My Love\n09.Kulu Valley (Ambient Remix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e581083fd4553937051d1bada6af93e038d6f7a","amp;dn":"Kashmir%3A+The+Symphonic+Led+Zeppelin+%281997%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e581083fd4553937051d1bada6af93e038d6f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,88,16,131,253,69,83,147,112,81,209,186,218,106,249,62,3,141,111,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
