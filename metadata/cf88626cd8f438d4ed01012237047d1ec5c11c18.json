Described as 'far beyond high-school level', this book grew out of the idea that teaching should not aim for the merely routine, but challenge pupils and stretch their ability through creativity and thorough comprehension of ideas.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nLÃ¡szlÃ³ Holics is a physicist and physics teacher, and has been teaching in the Apaczai Secondary School since 1959. He has worked for the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and is now a popular teacher among his students and the winner of numerous awards, including the prestigious LÃ¡szlÃ³ RÃ¡tz Honorary Award for Teachers. He has written several renowned books on physics, is Head of the Committee of the National Physics Competition for Secondary School Students, and is the Honorary President of LorÃ¡nd EÃ¶tvÃ¶s Physical Societyâ€™s Education Committee.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nHow to Use This Book. . . . v\r\nPhysical Constants alld Other Data.. . . vi\r\nPart I.
