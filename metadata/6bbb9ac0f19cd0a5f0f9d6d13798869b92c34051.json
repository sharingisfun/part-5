This arrangement, and the presence of an alphabetical index, allows the book to be used in two ways: either as a key to the vocabulary of a subject, or as an alphabetical dictionary in which the reader is referred to the section, or sections, in which the word is illustrated. \n\nThis second edition has been revised and updated to reflect the most up-to-date changes in technology, science and medicine, industry, and commerce and to offer even wider coverage of all major fields of reference, including the arts and entertainment, recreation and sport, flora and fauna and typical situations in domestic and everyday life. Over 1500 new items of vocabulary have been added relating to such diverse fields as photography, typesetting, personal computers, telecommunications and transport. The objects are organized thematically enabling the user to grasp the entire vocabulary relevant to a given situation or context.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bbb9ac0f19cd0a5f0f9d6d13798869b92c34051","amp;dn":"The+Pictorial+English+Dictionary-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bbb9ac0f19cd0a5f0f9d6d13798869b92c34051","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,187,154,192,241,156,208,165,240,249,214,209,55,152,134,155,146,195,64,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
