While the sound quality is undoubtedly due, at least in part, to the 64-bit processing within each module, it's also a credit to the overall design, including the multiband processing and the analog modeling.&quot;\nFull Review: http://www.musicianstechcentral.com/ozon2rev.html\n\nDigiFreq\n&quot;At such a low price, you might be thinking that Ozone is more of a toy than a serious tool. Think again. Ozone can go head-to-head with any of the other higher-priced products on the market. Its sound quality is superb, and its features provide the flexibility needed to make a final mix sound magical...&quot;\nFull Review: http://www.digifreq.com/digifreq/reviewdetails.asp?ProdReviewID=13\n\nStreamworks Audio\n&quot;a remarkable piece of software that, for under Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£200 provides an exceptionally elegant and great sounding toolbox for all the mastering requirements that any one in a project studio could require. Highly recommended!&quot;\nFull Review: http://www.streamworksaudio.com/contents.php?id=20\n\nCreative Cow\n&quot;After having been an engineer for more than 25 years of my life, it's rare that a product comes along that just blows me away. The iZotope Ozone is just that; a mind-blowing product. Not only is it the sexiest app I've ever seen, it actually sounds incredible.&quot;\n\nSound on Sound\n&quot;A layer of Ozone might be just what you need to help put a little life into your mixes&quot;\nOzone 1 review: http://www.sospubs.co.uk/sos/apr02/articles/izotopeozone.asp\nOzone 2 review: http://www.sospubs.co.uk/sos/jan03/articles/plugin0103.asp (at the end of the page at this link)\n\nRadio and Production Magazine\n&quot;It can easily sound as good as the Waves C4, and with the other modules that are not included in that processor, Ozone can sound much better. Comparing it to something like T-Racks is close as it can be setup in a similar manner, but Ozone is smoother and cleaner...&quot;\n\nEQ magazine\n&quot;Hits a high mark for graphic beauty, sound quality and flexibility. It's definitely a best buy&quot;\n\nLast but certainly not least, quotes from people that use Ozone day in and day out.\n\n&quot;Your loudness maximizer sounds better than anything I've heard, especially in the guitars department...and whatever side of the analog/digital/hardware/software fence you sit on, you gotta say 'wow great EQ'&quot;\nAaron Carey, Pipeline Audio (Phoenix, AZ)\n\n&quot;Ozone really takes mastering to a whole new level of capability and quality. Sure it has a great interface but it's the sound quality that sets it apart, including the best sounding software EQ that I have ever heard.&quot;\nTony Rockliff, Cybertown (Los Angeles, CA)\n\n&quot;The fact that all your 64 bit calculations are integrated within Ozone's framework really makes a difference to your sound.&quot;\nDave Hallock, Flat Cedar Recording (Cedar Ridge, CA)\n\n&quot;I believe that you just built the new holy grail of mastering plug-ins. The sound quality is equal to products costing 5 times as much, and the visual meters and UI are unmatched&quot;\nRoger Hart, Embryo Studios (Livermore, CA)\n\n&quot;The Loudness Maximizer is very smooth, I love the sound of the Stereo Imaging, and the Harmonic Exciter is something I can really make use of. Very, very nice job.&quot;\nGeorge Ware, Mac Money Studio (El Paso, Texas)\n\n&quot;Got it and used it for the first time tonight...not sure it's because of your tool yet, but this is the first time I've created my own mix that I like both low and high volumes. Very cool tool indeed...&quot;\nDavid Abraham Fenton, DFMedia, Inc. (Delran, NJ)\n\n&quot;Ozone is VERY impressive! It's what I've been looking for a very long time to put that final touch on my recording projects.&quot;\nKevin Goelz (Rhome, TX)\n\n&quot;I?m going to be using this on my new CD. Very clean and sweet GUI layout&quot;.\nBilly Townes, Shade Records (El Paso, TX)\n\n&quot;Ozone blew my mind the first time I heard it. A must have for mastering&quot;\nRon Jones, Jones Music\n\n&quot;My mixes are big, rich and smooth with the quality you would expect from an expensive analog/digital mastering house&quot;\nHugh Ferguson, Guitarist/Producer featured in Guitar Player Magazine and former guitarist for Graham Nash (Orange, CA)\n\n&quot;What a great tool. Six on-the-fly arrangable Mastering Processors and a very compact and usable user interface. The sound is as good as the user-interface is compact. I especially like the Mastering Reverb. It adds dimension of space without smearing or muddying it up. Simplicity of use but extremely powerful.&quot;\nKeith Welchel, S58 Studio (Clemson, SC)\n\n&quot;For those looking for a really great mastering plug in, I definitely recommend taking a look at Ozone&quot;\nSimeon Amburgey, Sound Creations, Inc.
