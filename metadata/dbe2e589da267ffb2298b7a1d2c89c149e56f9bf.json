Told in big themes and bold colors with blistering sound, the film is carved from over 1,200 hours of rarely-seen and never-before seen footage spanning the band's career. Pearl Jam Twenty is the definitive portrait of Pearl Jam: part concert film, part intimate insider-hang, part testimonial to the power of music and uncompromising artists. -- (C) Official Site\n\n\nPearl Jam Band Members:\n\nEddie Vedder\nActive: 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present\nInstruments: lead vocals\nEddie Vedder was a member of the original band formed in 1990\n\nMike McCready\nActive: 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present\nInstruments: lead guitar\nMike McCready was a member of the original band formed in 1990. \n\nStone Gossard\nActive: 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present\nInstruments: rhythm guitar, lead guitar , bass\nStone Gossard was a member of the original band formed in 1990.[7]\n\nJeff Ament\nActive: 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present\nInstruments: bass\nJeff Ament was a member of the original band formed in 1990.[7]\n\nMatt Cameron\nActive: 1998ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present\nInstruments: drums\n\nDave Krusen\nActive: 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1991\nInstruments: drums\nRelease contributions: Ten (1991)\nDave Krusen was a member of the original band formed in 1990.
