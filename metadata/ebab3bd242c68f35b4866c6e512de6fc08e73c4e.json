The conflicts quickly escalated from a church problem to a diplomatic crisis that divided Europe. Secular leaders had to choose which claimant they would recognize. The split lasted about 40 years from 1378 to 1417. \n\n\nThere are 17 titles in this UL:\n\n1- Wikipedia - East vs. West Schism\n\n2- Fortescue - The Orthodox Eastern Church (1908)\n\n3- McGucken - The Orthodox Church (2008)\n\n4- Ffoulkes - Christendom's Division of the Christian Family in the East and West (1865)\n\n5- Tondini - The Pope of Rome and the Popes of the Oriental Orthodox Church (1875)\n\n6- Congar - After Nine Hundred Years (1959)\n\n7- Howard - The Schism between the Oriental and Western Churches (1892)\n\n8- Bradshaw - Aristotle East and West: Metaphysics and the Division of Christendom (2004)\n\n9- Guettee - The Papacy and its Historic Origins and Primitive Relations with Eastern Churches (1866)\n\n10- Wikipedia - The Western Schism\n\n11- Locke - Age of the Great Western Schism (1897)\n\n12- Jordan - The Inner History of the Great Schism of the West (1930)\n\n13- Salembier - The Great Schism of the West (1907)\n\n14- Isaacson - Story of the Later Popes (1906)\n\n15- Smith - The Great Schism of the West\n\n16- Perceval - The Roman Schism Illustrated from the Records of the Catholic Church (1836)\n\n17- Swanson - Universities, Academics and the Great Schism (1979)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebab3bd242c68f35b4866c6e512de6fc08e73c4e","amp;dn":"Schisms+in+Christianity+-+The+East-West+Schism%2C+The+Great+Wester","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebab3bd242c68f35b4866c6e512de6fc08e73c4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,171,59,210,66,198,143,53,180,134,108,110,81,45,230,252,8,231,60,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
