Each of the book's three sections--direct current, alternating current, and magnetism--begins with step-by-step instructions for setting up your lab for the experiments that follow. Using inexpensive, easy-to-find parts, the experiments progress from basic to more complex and will spark ideas and encourage inventiveness. Expect unexpected results when you experiment with: \n- Diode-based voltage reducer \n- Compass-based galvanometer \n- Photovoltaic illuminometer \n- Utility bulb saver \n- Ripple filter \n- Xener-diode voltage regulator \n- AC spectrum monitor \n- Ampere's law with wire loop \n- AC electromagnet \n- Handheld wind turbine \n- And dozens more projects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e1c55759b5037138079042ee41648ba31686d6","amp;dn":"Electricity+Experiments+You+Can+Do+At+Home+by+Stan+Gibilisco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e1c55759b5037138079042ee41648ba31686d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,225,197,87,89,181,3,113,56,7,144,66,238,65,100,139,163,22,134,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
