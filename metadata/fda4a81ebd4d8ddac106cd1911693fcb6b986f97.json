Winthrop (1864Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1943) was a lawyer and banker, but his true passion was collecting art. He had the resources, the intuition, and the talented advisers to help him create a collection that is distinct in its depth, breadth, and quality. The Winthrop Collection of French, British, and American art includes the best group of Delacroix and Ingres drawings outside of France, the most signiÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cant group of Pre-Raphaelite paintings outside of Britain, and a world-renowned collection of Sargent watercolors.\n\nSome seventy paintings and twice as many drawings and watercolors by more than Ã¯Â¬ï¿½fty French, British, and American artists are featured in this selection from the legendary Winthrop Collection, bequeathed to the Fogg Museum in 1943. Included are masterpieces by David, Ingres, GÃƒÂ©ricault, ChassÃƒÂ©riau, and Moreau; Blake, Rossetti, and Burne-Jones; and Homer, Sargent, and Whistler. They are discussed in the catalogue by more than sixty authors, all of whom are leading authorities in their various Ã¯Â¬ï¿½elds.\n\nThis book is the catalogue for an exhibition held at the MusÃƒÂ©e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon, France, March 15Ã¢â‚¬â€œ26, 2003; the National Gallery, London, June 25Ã¢â‚¬â€œSeptember 14, 2003; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 20, 2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œJanuary 25, 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fda4a81ebd4d8ddac106cd1911693fcb6b986f97","amp;dn":"A+Private+passion+-+19th+-+century+paintings+and+drawings+from+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fda4a81ebd4d8ddac106cd1911693fcb6b986f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,164,168,30,189,77,141,218,193,6,205,25,17,105,63,203,107,152,111,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
