This is the type of &quot;Little&quot; movie the British are so famous for (Waking Ned Devine, The Full Monty).\n  The story is simple -- materialistic Peter Reigert is sent to a small Scottish village to try to negotiate a land deal for his rich, eccentric boss (Burt Lancaster, who is outstanding). He arrives in Scotland as a guy who is only obsessed with business deals, his car, and his posessions back in Texas, but soon he learns there are more important things in life. The townsfolk are absolutely wonderful, all in their own unique, eclectic way. Denis Lawson particularly shines as &quot;jack of all trades&quot; who holds several positions in the community, including innkeeper. And let's not forget Burt Lancasters analyst who seems to enjoy his job just a little too much.\n\n  Starring: Burt Lancaster, Peter Riegert, Denis Lawson.\n\n  Directed by: Bill Forsyth.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 51min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 400","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:679e6a89fd3b0ced4d4000d2d1955256bc26189d","amp;dn":"Local+Hero+%281983%29+%28Burt+Lancaster%2C+Peter+Riegert%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"679e6a89fd3b0ced4d4000d2d1955256bc26189d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,158,106,137,253,59,12,237,77,64,0,210,209,149,82,86,188,38,24,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
