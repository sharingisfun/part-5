Memories of himself as a young man, tossed by fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Memories of a world filled with freaks and clowns, with wonder and pain and anger and passion; a world with its own narrow, irrational rules, its own way of life, and its ownway of death. The world of the circus: to Jacob it was both salvation and a living hell.\n\nJacob was there because his luck had run outÃ¢â‚¬â€orphaned and penniless, he had no direction until he landed on this locomotive &quot;ship of fools.&quot; It was the early part of the Great Depression, and everyone in this third-rate circus was lucky to have any job at all. Marlena, the star of the equestrian act, was there because she fell in love with the wrong man, a handsome circus boss with a wide mean streak. And Rosie the elephant was there because she was the great gray hope, the new act that was going to be the salvation of the circus; the only problem was, Rosie didn't have an actÃ¢â‚¬â€in fact, she couldn't even follow instructions. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.\n\nSurprising, poignant, and funny, Water for Elephants is that rare novel with a story so engrossing, one is reluctant to put it down; with characters so engaging, they continue to live long after the last page has been turned; with a world built of wonder, a world so real, one starts to breathe its air.\n\n\n \n                   Riding Lessons: A Novel, 2004\n\nAs a world-class equestrian and Olympic contender, Annemarie Zimmer lived for the thrill of flight atop a strong, graceful animal. Then, at eighteen, a tragic accident destroyed her riding career and Harry, the beautiful horse she cherished.\n\nNow, twenty years later, Annemarie is coming home to her dying father's New Hampshire horse farm. Jobless and abandoned, she is bringing her troubled teenage daughter to this place of pain and memory, where ghosts of an unresolved youth still haunt the fields and stablesÃ¢â‚¬â€and where hope lives in the eyes of the handsome, gentle veterinarian Annemarie loved as a girl . . . and in the seductive allure of a trainer with a magic touch.\n\nBut everything will change yet again with one glimpse of a white striped gelding startlingly similar to the one Annemarie lost in another lifetime. And an obsession is born that could shatter her fragile world.\n\n\n\n                    Flying Changes, 2005\n\nTwenty years after her competitive riding career died, Annemarie Zimmer worries that her relationship with the man she loves is off course, and fears that daughter Eva's own dreams of Olympic glory will carry her far from home ... and into harm's way.\n\nWhen the teenage Eva is invited to audition for a world-class trainer, Annemarie realizes that she must give Eva a chance to soar. But when Eva falls in love with a spectacular blue roan Nokota who hasn't let anyone ride him since his arrival at the barn, Annemarie's doubts come crashing back.\n\nIt is a time of change at Maple Brook, when fears must be saddled and broken. And one remarkable family must learn how to deal with Flying Changes.\n\n\n\n                    Ape House, 2010\n\nFrom the author of Water for Elephants comes the story of a family of bonobo apes that is violently torn from their laboratory by animal liberation activists and placed on a TV reality show. Like Gruen's phenomenal bestseller Water for Elephants, this novel explores humans' relationships with animals and shows that animals have much to teach people about what it means to be human.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99849fe9515ea13ccfedc1e18fd852f3be6bd239","amp;dn":"Sara+Gruen+%284+Novels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99849fe9515ea13ccfedc1e18fd852f3be6bd239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,132,159,233,81,94,161,60,207,237,193,225,143,216,82,243,190,107,210,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
