However, all features and functionality are always available by using a keyboard, mouse, or other standard or accessible input device. Note that new touch features are optimised for use with Windows 8.\n\nAdditional requirements and considerations\nSome functionality may vary, based on the system configuration. Some features may require additional or advanced hardware or server connectivity.\n\nNote: System requirements are rounded up to the nearest 0.5 GB, to be conservative. For example, if we measure an applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s required hard disk space to be 1.99 GB, we recommend 2.5 GB of disk space. Our hard disk system requirements are intentionally larger than the actual disk space usage of the software.\n\nA graphics processor helps increase the performance of certain features, such as drawing tables in Excel 2013 or transitions, animations, and video integration in PowerPoint 2013. Use of a graphics processor with Office 2013 requires a Microsoft DirectX 10-compliant graphics processor that has 64 MB of video memory. These processors were widely available in 2007. Most computers that are available today include a graphics processor that meets or exceeds this standard. However, if you or your users do not have a graphics processor, you can still run Office 2013.\n* An appropriate device, internet connection and supported browser is required.\n\nCompatible with Windows 8 or 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2012.
