Formed in September 1995, the group was founded by percussionist Shawn Crahan and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in their early days, the band consisted of nine members for the greater part of their tenure: Sid Wilson, Joey Jordison, Paul Gray, Chris Fehn, Jim Root, Craig Jones, Shawn Crahan, Mick Thomson, and Corey Taylor. However, the death of Paul Gray on May 24, 2010, and the departure of Joey Jordison on December 12, 2013, left the band with seven remaining members.\n\nSlipknot is well known for its attention-grabbing image, aggressive music style, and energetic and chaotic live shows.[7][8] The band enjoyed a somewhat meteoric rise to success following the release of their self-titled debut album in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album Iowa further increased the band's popularity. After breaking for their first hiatus, Slipknot returned in 2004 with Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) and once again in 2008 with their fourth album All Hope Is Gone, which debuted at the top spot on the Billboard 200. Slipknot released their fifth studio album and first","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cc890e92a8cb7318e9e31fee029df51655832fb","amp;dn":"Slipknot+Discography+1996+-2014+%28P.a.I.D.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cc890e92a8cb7318e9e31fee029df51655832fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,200,144,233,42,140,183,49,142,158,49,254,224,41,223,81,101,88,50,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
