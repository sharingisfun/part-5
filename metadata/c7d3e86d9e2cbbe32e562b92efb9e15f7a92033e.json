Especially those species known for eating the bugs that eat plants. Assassin bugs, damsel bugs, and predatory stink bugs are all carnivores that devour the bugs that dine on a garden.\n\nAttracting Beneficial Bugs to Your Garden is a book about bugs and plants, and how to create a garden that benÃ‚Â¬efits from both. In addition to information on companion planting and commercial options for purchasing bugs, there are 19 detailed bug profiles and 39 plant profiles. The bug profiles include a description, a photograph for identification, an explanation of what they do for the garden, and the methods gardeners can use to attract them. The plant profiles highlight the best plants for attracting beneficial bugs and offer detailed information on size, care requirements, zone information, and bloom time. Design plans show gardeners how to design a border specifically for the bugs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7d3e86d9e2cbbe32e562b92efb9e15f7a92033e","amp;dn":"Attracting+Beneficial+Bugs+to+Your+Garden%3A+A+Natural+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7d3e86d9e2cbbe32e562b92efb9e15f7a92033e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,211,232,109,158,44,187,227,46,86,43,146,239,185,225,95,122,146,3,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
