To become leader of the division, he ignites a power struggle which gains him more enemies than admirers. Eventually, even his gang turn their backs on him and Loughnan stabs him several times in a failed assassination attempt. Chopper voluntarily has his ears cut off by a fellow inmate in order to be transferred out of the H Division; this also gains him recognition in and out of the prison.\nHe is released in 1986, revisiting enemies and friends whom he cannot differentiate anymore. He reunites with his former girlfriend Tanya (Kate Beahan), but suspects that she is involved with one of his old victims, Neville Bartos (Vince Colosimo). He tracks Bartos down, shoots him and takes him to the hospital, unabashedly claiming that he has a &quot;green light&quot; courtesy of the Police &quot;to exterminate scum&quot;. When Chopper learns that he is now the target of a death-contract, he goes after his old friend Jimmy, only to find him worn out and poverty stricken by drugs with a daughter and a junkie fiancÃƒÂ©e who is months pregnant with another child on the way.\nHe kills a criminal known as Siam &quot;Sammy the Turk&quot; Ozerkam at a bar, but gets away with it by claiming it was self-defense. He eventually ends up back in prison where he writes a book about his experiences in the Melbourne underworld. The book becomes a best-seller and Chopper becomes a criminal legend.\nThe film ends with Chopper in his prison cell in 1992, watching himself being interviewed on television. He is proud of the interview among those watching with him, but when they leave he goes quiet and the film ends with him sitting in his cell alone. \n\nTHIS TORRENT FILE IS 100% Australian !!!\n\nSEE_ME_TORRENTS'N_SEED_ME_TORRENTS\n\n           (Thank You)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d400263ed89d8bcac2a46bfabca5b6697276714","amp;dn":"Chopper+2000.DVDRip.H.263.DivX+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d400263ed89d8bcac2a46bfabca5b6697276714","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,64,2,99,237,137,216,188,172,42,70,191,171,202,91,102,151,39,103,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
