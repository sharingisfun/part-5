From the perils of French dentistry to the eating habits of the Australian kookaburra, from the squat-style toilets of Beijing to the particular wilderness of a North Carolina Costco, we learn about the absurdity and delight of a curious traveler's experiences. Whether railing against the habits of litterers in the English countryside or marveling over a disembodied human arm in a taxidermist's shop, Sedaris takes us on side-splitting adventures that are not to be forgotten.\nGenre: Essays, Memoirs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4942dcce694f27684f157cc64027cf29e0e5771a","amp;dn":"Let%27s+Explore+Diabetes+with+Owls+-+David+Sedaris.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4942dcce694f27684f157cc64027cf29e0e5771a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,66,220,206,105,79,39,104,79,21,124,198,64,39,207,41,224,229,119,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
