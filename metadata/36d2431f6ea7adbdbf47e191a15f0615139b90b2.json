Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor. He personally conceived and completed public works costing 27 billion dollars--the greatest builder America (and probably the world) has ever known. Without ever having been elected to office, he dominated the men who were--even his most bitter enemy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could not control him--until he finally encountered, in Nelson Rockefeller, the only man whose power (and ruthlessness in wielding it) equalled his own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36d2431f6ea7adbdbf47e191a15f0615139b90b2","amp;dn":"Robert+A.+Caro+-+The+Power+Broker+-+Robert+Moses+and+the+Fall+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36d2431f6ea7adbdbf47e191a15f0615139b90b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,210,67,31,110,167,173,189,191,71,225,145,161,95,6,21,19,155,144,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
