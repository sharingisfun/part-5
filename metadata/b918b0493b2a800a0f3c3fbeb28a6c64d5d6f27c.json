Do you want every medical intervention known to science or do you want to go it alone, without the help of a doctor or midwife? And what about after birth? Perhaps you'll hang on to your baby's placenta and carry it around with your newborn until it dries and drops off naturally? Or maybe you'll decide to eat it by whizzing it up into a smoothie?\nThis film follows four pregnant women all making very different choices around their births, all determined to do it their way. 37-year-old Jo plans to deliver her baby completely alone on board her barge, without the assistance of any medical professional. By contrast, 34-year-old Anna is opting to sidestep the pains of labour and book in for a c-section at the Portland Hospital in London. Anna wants all the medication available and she doesn't want to feel a thing\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0544gy8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0544gy8&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;236b4a444b636f170d12&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 3031 Kbps \nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: AAC LC\nAudio English \nAudio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo 2\nRun-Time: 50mins\nFramerate:  25 fps\nNumber of Parts: 1\nContainer Mp4\nPart Size: 1.11 GB\nSource: HDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65 \n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b918b0493b2a800a0f3c3fbeb28a6c64d5d6f27c","amp;dn":"BBC.Childbirth.All.Or.Nothing.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b918b0493b2a800a0f3c3fbeb28a6c64d5d6f27c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,24,176,73,59,42,128,10,15,60,63,190,178,138,108,100,213,214,242,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
