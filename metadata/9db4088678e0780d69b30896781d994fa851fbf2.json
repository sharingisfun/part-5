Hinson and the NothingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, his first release on French label, Talitres, comprises a collection of songs written before a bad car accident, whilst touring Spain during the summer of 2011. Flown back to Texas, doctors were consulted and the future use of MicahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arms hung in the balance. With this in mind, he began listening to demos heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d made before the Spanish trip. The songs took on a new light and he began sending them off to people around the world including The Twilight Sad and his Texan side-kick, T. Nicholas Phelps. With their help Micah began to create a record without the use of his arms.\n\nMicah was subsequently invited to record in Santander, Spain, at Moon River Studio. For two weeks and two days, with the assisitance of enginer by Fernanda Ã¢â‚¬ËœMacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Macava, Micah realised what was to become Ã¢â‚¬ËœMicah P. Hinson and The NothingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, working with an astounding array of local musicians Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Aquattro String Quartet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9db4088678e0780d69b30896781d994fa851fbf2","amp;dn":"Micah+P.+Hinson+-+Micah+P.Hinson+and+the+Nothing+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9db4088678e0780d69b30896781d994fa851fbf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,180,8,134,120,224,120,13,105,179,8,150,120,29,153,79,168,81,251,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
