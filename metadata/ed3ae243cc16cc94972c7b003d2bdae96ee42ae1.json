And if you understand the word problem but have no idea where to begin with the math, again, you will not do well.\r\n\r\nThe Ultimate Physics 3 Tutor, Volume 1 is the first volume in the Electricity and Magnetism series and begins at the very beginning assuming the student has never been exposed to this material. \r\n\r\nThe course then proceeds to introduce new topics in an easy-to-understand fashion. The course is a 4 DVD series, 13 full hours in duration, and contains 13 chapters of material so you can be assured that all of the core topics are covered in detail. What sets this DVD apart from the rest is that the concepts are taught entirely through example problems. The easiest way to learn Physics is to work problems as you learn the material - and that is exactly what this 4 DVD series provides. You will immediately improve your problem-solving skills which will help on homework and exams, and you will have a reference for many of the commonly asked problems in Physics. If you have a problem with your homework, simply find a similar problem fully worked on the Ultimate Physics Tutor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics Covered;\r\n\r\nSection 1: Electric Charge and Coulomb's Law\r\nSection 2: Electric Field due to a Point Charge\r\nSection 3: Electric Field due to a dipole\r\nSection 4: Electric Field due to a Charged Ring\r\nSection 5: Gauss' Law, Part 1\r\nSection 6: Gauss' Law, Part 2\r\nSection 7: Gauss' Law, Cylindrical Symmetry\r\nSection 8: Gauss' Law, Planar Symmetry\r\nSection 9: Gauss' Law, Spherical Symmetry\r\nSection 10: Electric Potential, Part 1\r\nSection 11: Electric Potential, Part 2\r\nSection 12: Electric Potential of Point Charges\r\nSection 13: Electric Potential of a Dipole and Continuous Charge Distributions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed3ae243cc16cc94972c7b003d2bdae96ee42ae1","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Physics+Tutor+Course+3.1+-+Electricity+%26amp%3B+Magnetism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed3ae243cc16cc94972c7b003d2bdae96ee42ae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,58,226,67,204,22,204,148,151,44,123,0,61,43,218,233,110,228,42,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
