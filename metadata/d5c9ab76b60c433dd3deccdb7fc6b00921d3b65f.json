DNA evidence reveals that both came from the same body: the long dead Mongol king Genghis Khan.\n\nCommander Gray Pierce and Sigma Force set out to discover a truth tied to the fall of the Roman Empire, to a mystery going back to the birth of Christianity, and to a weapon hidden for centuries that holds the fate of humanity.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
