It might weigh less than 20 kilograms, but this intrepid member of the weasel family has been known to back down marauding bears and wolves in defense of its young or its food. Armed with fearsome claws and canines, a bite force stronger than any other carnivore on earth and a reputation for fearlessness, the wolverine, whose Latin name Gulo gulo literally means glutton, is not the kind of animal any other animal, humans included, really wants to mess with.\r\nBut nasty reputation aside, the reality is we really don't know much about the secretive world and life of the wolverine. Living in remote areas of the boreal forest, it is rarely ever seen. After two decades of filming most of the other major predators of the north, award-winning cinematographer Andrew Manske takes up the ultimate challenge of his career when he set out to make a film about this animal.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/73/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/58/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2e/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0c/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Wolverine-Ghost-of-the-Northern-Forest-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3157 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 994 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/wolverine-ghost-of-the-northern-forest\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Wolverine%3A%20Chasing%20the%20Phantom \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Wild%20Canada","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30445e134e0b05ae7f67bb2e3d55338481b20a8d","amp;dn":"The+Nature+Of+Things+Wolverine+Ghost+of+the+Northern+Forest+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30445e134e0b05ae7f67bb2e3d55338481b20a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,68,94,19,78,11,5,174,127,103,187,46,61,85,51,132,129,178,10,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
