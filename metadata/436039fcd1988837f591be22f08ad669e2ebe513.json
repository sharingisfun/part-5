It addresses the subject of female circumcision, a common practice in a number of African countries, especially nations immediately south of the Sahara desert. The film is set in a village in Burkina Faso, and was filmed in the remote village of Djerrisso, Burkina Faso. The film argues strongly against the practice, depicting a village woman, Colle, who uses moolaadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (magical protection) to protect a group of girls. She is opposed by the villagers who believe in the necessity of circumcision, which they call 'purification'.\n\nThe film is a co-production between companies from several Francophone nations: Senegal, France, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Morocco and Tunisia.\n\nThe film won the Prix Un Certain Regard and a special mention in the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 2004. Prominent American film critic Roger Ebert is a big supporter of the film, naming it one of his top ten of the year.\n\n---=Audio=-------------------------------------\t\n\t0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\n\t48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0) \n\tInterleave: 96 ms (2.4 v.frames), preload=96\n\t\t\n---=Video=-------------------------------------\t\n\t(CD1)\n\t672 x 368 @ 25.000 fps\n\t58:05.040, 87,126 frames\n\tQf 0.240/1486 kbps\n\t\n----(CD2)\n\t672 x 368 @ 25.000 fps\n\t1:01:35, 92,373 frames\n\tQf 0.225/1391 kbps\n\t\n---=Size=--------------------------------------\n\t734,005,248 (87,216 frames) (CD1)\n\t734,363,648 (92,373 frames) (CD2)\n\n---=Subtitles=---------------------------------\t\nSubtitles provided in English in SRT format.\n\n---=Notes=-------------------------------------\t\nThis is a different sort of upload.
