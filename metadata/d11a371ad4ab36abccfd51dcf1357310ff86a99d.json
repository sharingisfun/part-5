Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in\r\nthe Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100, and have s\r\nold 70 million records.\r\n\r\nWhile they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene, along with\r\nbands such as Spandau Ballet, when they first emerged, the band later shed this image.\r\nThe band worked with fashion designers to build a sharp and elegant image.\r\nThe band has won a number of awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards\r\nincluding the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards,\r\nand an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement.\r\nThey were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\r\n\r\nThe band's controversial videos, which included partial nudity and suggestions of sexuality,\r\nbecame popular in the early 1980s on the then-new music video channel, MTV.\r\nDuran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot by professional directors\r\nwith 35 mm film movie cameras, which gave their videos a much more polished look than\r\nwas standard at the time. In 1984, the band were early innovators with video technology\r\nin their live stadium shows.\r\n\r\nThe group was formed by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, with the later\r\naddition of drummer Roger Taylor, and after numerous personnel changes, guitarist\r\nAndy Taylor and lead singer Simon Le Bon. These five members featured in their most\r\ncommercially successful line-up. The group has never disbanded, but after separation\r\nof Andy Taylor in 1986, the line-up has changed to include former Missing Persons guitarist\r\nWarren Cuccurullo from 1989 to 2001 and drummer Sterling Campbell from 1989 to 1991.\r\nThe reunion of the original five members in the early 2000s created a stir among the band's\r\nfans and music media. Andy Taylor left the band once again in mid-2006, and guitarist\r\nDom Brown has since been working with the band as a session player and touring member.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio Information, Torrent File Contents And Specifications\r\n\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: Duran Duran\r\nGenre: Pop / Synth-pop / Electronic / Dance / Rock\r\nAlbums Release Years: 1981 To 2015\r\nNumber of CD's: 14\r\nNumber of Tracks: 171\r\nTotal Playing Time: 12 Hours, 15 Minutes and 42 Seconds (735 Minutes)\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526 and libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate (Average): 949 kbps\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Normal Stereo)\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio Files Source: Compact\r\nConverter / Encoder (From CD): EAC V1.0 beta 6 and V1.1 [64 bit]\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tag Format: VorbisComment\r\nTag Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nImage Files: Front and Back Album Covers (embedded artwork within audio files)\r\nAdditional Files: LOG, CUE, MD5, FFP, M3U, foo dr and Track Lists\r\nTotal File Size: 4.95 GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d11a371ad4ab36abccfd51dcf1357310ff86a99d","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+Studio+Albums+%5B1981+-+2015%5D+%5BFLAC+-+EAC%5D+BSW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d11a371ad4ab36abccfd51dcf1357310ff86a99d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,26,55,26,212,171,54,171,204,253,81,220,241,53,115,16,255,134,169,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
