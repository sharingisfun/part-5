Select all the RAR files together right click extract them (with Winrar or Winzip). If you don't have winrar or winzip google it, download it and install it.\n2. Folder you get us GVMAT3D6.0.SR2. Open it\n3. Open rhinoceros folder run Rhino4_Setup\n   Open the crack folder and run the keygen to generate a key for rhino setup\n4. Now open Rhinoceros SR5 and run Rhinoceros_v4-1.0_SR5_2009\n5. Then run RHINO 4 SR5_Crk\n6. Click patch it will patch saying patched sucessfully  or will tell you to locate the file click normally c:programme filesRhinoceros 4.0systemrhino4.exe\n7. Select this file click open  then u see mesage that its been patched sucessfuly or click patch.\n8. Run Matrix v60 install. install it\n9. Run matrix v60 update\n10. Unrar the crack matrix v60 update you will get folder crack matrix v60 update.\n11. In that folder open folder M or R ther is a file.\n12. there is a file m60run copy that file\n13. Now go to C:programme filesmatrix60\n14. Right click paste the copied file m60run into the folder\n15. double click the icon mtrix is ON. You can roll that joint now.\n16. This m60run icon you have to click to run.\n17. All the other Matrix6.0, matrix running files will not work including the one in the start menu.\n17. So make a shorcut of this Icon after pasting on the desktop to run matrix.\n\nCaution\t: Never Update or instally any service pack for matrix or Rhinoceros from internet the software will stop working then.\n\nImportant\t: When you will scan zip files with antivirus they will show trojan but it is not a virus it is just the crack file to run rhino and matrix. So you have to be careful when virus scanning. If you will scan with antivirus you will notice that file name &quot;GVSMAT3D.6.0.SR2.part14&quot; &amp; &quot;GVSMAT3D.6.0.SR2.part1&quot;  will show virus and will be deleted when scanned with anti virus. It is not virus it is the crack file. I have Mc afee anti virus and this is what happened to me. Solution is write these installation files on a DVD and keep them safe or Make an ISO image file with Nero or Magic ISO and save it.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tOnce your matrix is installed itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fully functional and will never have any problems.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tTo my best I tried to explain it in best possible manner \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIf you are not able to understand anything ask help from your friend or someone else who is a computer geek.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThese files work they just do.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIf you want to know more about Gemvision Matrix Software go to http://www.gemvision.com/html/products/matrix/matrix.html\n\n\n\nFew last things after downloading and installation please leave a comment \nplease leave a comment \nplease leave a comment\nplease leave a comment\nplease leave a comment\nplease leave a comment\nplease leave a comment\nPlease Please seed it for atleast few days after downloading.\nUse and Learn the software if you like it buy the Licenced version please.\n\n\nTrackers you can add manually:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nudp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce\n\n\nudp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://66.96.232.85/opentracker/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://66.96.232.85/opentracker/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:929bf985f05c948652fc3ebc49202368ab6d40a0","amp;dn":"Gemvision+Matrix+6.0+SR2+Rhino+4.0+SR5+%28FIXED+READ+PIRATEBAY+INS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"929bf985f05c948652fc3ebc49202368ab6d40a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,155,249,133,240,92,148,134,82,252,62,188,73,32,35,104,171,109,64,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
