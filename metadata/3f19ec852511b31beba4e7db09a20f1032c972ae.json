They were not nice boys; nice boys don't play rock &amp; roll. They were ugly, misogynistic, and violent; they were also funny, vulnerable, and occasionally sensitive, as their breakthrough hit, &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine,&quot; showed. While Slash and Izzy Stradlin ferociously spit out dueling guitar riffs worthy of Aerosmith or the Stones, Axl Rose screeched out his tales of sex, drugs, and apathy in the big city. Meanwhile, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler were a limber rhythm section who kept the music loose and powerful. Guns N' Roses' music was basic and gritty, with a solid hard, bluesy base; they were dark, sleazy, dirty, and honest -- everything that good hard rock and heavy metal should be. There was something refreshing about a band that could provoke everything from devotion to hatred, especially since both sides were equally right. There hadn't been a hard rock band this raw or talented in years, and they were given added weight by Rose's primal rage, the sound of confused, frustrated white trash vying for his piece of the pie. As the '80s became the '90s, there simply wasn't a more interesting band around, but owing to intra-band friction and the emergence of alternative rock, Rose's supporting cast gradually disintegrated, as he spent years in seclusion.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Welcome To The Jungle\n02.Sweet Child O' Mine\n03.Patience\n04.Paradise City\n05.Knockin' On Heaven's Door\n06.Civil War\n07.You Could Be Mine\n08.Don't Cry (Original)\n09.November Rain\n10.Live And Let Die\n11.Yesterdays\n12.Ain't It Fun\n13.Since I Don't Have You\n14.Sympathy For The Devil\n\n\nI know that there are several previous uploads of this CD, but this is a very clean &amp; crisp sounding Cd rip that I wanted to share.
