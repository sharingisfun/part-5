I wanted to show how exciting acoustic instruments can be, how dynamic and rich and heart-thumpingly raw they can sound at a time when acoustic music seems either too cute or too soppy. Obvious influences here are the amazing Martin Carthy, the late, great Davey Graham and the late, great John Martyn.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1402cbe1d057d22643d78c8a4f7abf340fc3feaf","amp;dn":"Graham+Coxon+-+The+Spinning+Top+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1402cbe1d057d22643d78c8a4f7abf340fc3feaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,2,203,225,208,87,210,38,67,215,140,138,79,122,191,52,15,195,254,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
