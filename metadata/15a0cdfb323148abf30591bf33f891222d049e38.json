Sarah is a lost 15-year-old, trapped in an unloving home, in a dreary small paper mill town. When she meets Spike, she envisions a new life for herself. Falling in love, Sarah and Spike go on a crime spree of small-time con jobs, both to support themselves and their drug habit. Spike has dreams of his own, and when he successfully auditions for a band, he can't help but feel that he and Sarah are starting on the road to escaping their ill-fated existence. But just as things are looking up, everything goes uncontrollably wrong, and Spike and Sarah have only their undying love for each other as a means of survival against all odds. Director/writer Nick Lyon's Punk Love is a modern-day fairy tale about two fallen angels searching for meaning in a world without pity. As Spike, Chad Lindberg gives an outstanding performance as a man-child whose love knows no bounds, even when such bounds are called for. Emma Bing, as Sarah, is achingly vulnerable as a teenager desperate to keep a glimmer of hope alive of the better life she dreams of. In the end, all Spike and Sarah have are each other, and their love for one another, a love that can't be torn apart. Unconditional love.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bef19a157a6.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bef19a157a6.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bef19a5b506.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bef19a5b506.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bef19a9848f.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bef19a9848f.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15a0cdfb323148abf30591bf33f891222d049e38","amp;dn":"Punk+Love+%282006%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15a0cdfb323148abf30591bf33f891222d049e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,160,205,251,50,49,72,171,243,5,145,191,51,248,145,34,45,4,158,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
