Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult is the eponymous debut album by the American hard rock band Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult, released in 16 January 1972. The album featured songs such as &quot;Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot;, and &quot;Then Came the Last Days of May&quot;, all of which the band still plays regularly during its concerts. Despite positive reviews, the album failed to chart for some time before finally cracking the Billboard 200 on May 20, 1972 and peaking at No. 172.[1] Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult toured with artists such as The Byrds, Alice Cooper and the Mahavishnu Orchestra to support the album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3070ecbffd8447c381218099063d34c0828f2b6a","amp;dn":"Blue+Oyster+Cult+%5B1972%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3070ecbffd8447c381218099063d34c0828f2b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,112,236,191,253,132,71,195,129,33,128,153,6,61,52,192,130,143,43,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
