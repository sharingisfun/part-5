Vir2 has meticulously recorded six different acoustic instruments: a steel-string guitar, twelve-string, nylon string, ukulele, mandolin, and guitalele, and presents them in astonishing detail. It features both plectrum and finger picking, and Blumlein stereo recordings alongside the piezo pickup perspective. Thousands of samples across more than a dozen articulations were recorded for each instrument, including sustains, mutes, releases, legatos, hammer-ons and pull-offs, slides, harmonics, and effects. Acou6tics also features virtual room control with adjustable mic distance and sympathetic resonance.\n\nAcou6tics is powered by the industry-leading Kontakt engine. It is compatible with VST, RTAS (Pro Tools 9 &amp; 10), and AAX (Pro Tools 10 &amp; 11) plug-in formats allowing it to work seamlessly within any major sequencer, in addition to standalone use. \n\n=======[ Instruction ]===============================================================\n\nFor Kontakt 5.3 (and above)\n\n--- [ METHOD I ] ---\n\n- Open Kontakt 5.3 (and above)\n- Go to File tab\n- Browse for the torrent folder\n- Drag n Drop the NKI files into the Right Panel to use.\n\n--- [ METHOD II ] ---\n\n- Go to Library tab\n- Click Add Library\n- Browse for the library folder's location\n- Click Ok/Yes\n- Accept or Yes when asked\n\n=======[ Extra ]=====================================================================\n\nI DO NOT OWN THIS PRODUCT - IF YOU ENJOY IT, PLEASE CONSIDER BUYING TO SUPPORT OWNER!\n\n=======[ Greets ]====================================================================\n\nGreeting to awesome uploaders:\n\n- deepstatus\n- NewSky006\n- imafaggot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97ac62f3aa9a9acfc6a7bdbf4362097b8bab3252","amp;dn":"Vir2+-+Acou6tics+%5BKONTAKT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97ac62f3aa9a9acfc6a7bdbf4362097b8bab3252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,172,98,243,170,154,154,207,198,167,189,191,67,98,9,123,139,171,50,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
