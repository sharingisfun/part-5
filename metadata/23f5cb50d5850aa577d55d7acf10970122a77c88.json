The handbook is based on observations collected in Iraq during July and August 2004 by an IO collection and analysis team (CAAT). The application of this tool is both for training and real-world events the Soldier may encounter in the Iraqi area of operations.\n\nBecause Soldiers are primarily warfighters, this handbook emphasizes those concepts key to operational planning for conflict. It provides a basis for Soldiers to understand the relevance of information operations and a planning framework for the implementation of information operations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f5cb50d5850aa577d55d7acf10970122a77c88","amp;dn":"Tactical+Commander%26rsquo%3Bs+Handbook+Information+Operations+Opera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f5cb50d5850aa577d55d7acf10970122a77c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,245,203,80,213,133,10,165,119,213,93,122,207,16,151,1,34,167,124,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
