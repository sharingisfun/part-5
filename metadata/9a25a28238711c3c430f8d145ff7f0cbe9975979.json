Simultaneously more focused and ambitious than any of his previous records, Purple Rain finds Prince consolidating his funk and R&amp;B roots while moving boldly into pop, rock, and heavy metal with nine superbly crafted songs. Even its best-known songs don't tread conventional territory: the bass-less &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; is an eerie, spare neo-psychedelic masterpiece; &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; is a furious blend of metallic guitars, Stonesy riffs, and a hard funk backbeat; the anthemic title track is a majestic ballad filled with brilliant guitar flourishes. Although Prince's songwriting is at a peak, the presence of the Revolution pulls the music into sharper focus, giving it a tougher, more aggressive edge. And, with the guidance of Wendy and Lisa, Prince pushed heavily into psychedelia, adding swirling strings to the dreamy &quot;Take Me With U&quot; and the hard rock of &quot;Baby I'm a Star.&quot; Even with all of his new, but uncompromising, forays into pop, Prince hasn't abandoned funk, and the robotic jam of &quot;Computer Blue&quot; and the menacing grind of &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; are among his finest songs. Taken together, all of the stylistic experiments add up to a stunning statement of purpose that remains one of the most exciting rock &amp; roll albums ever recorded.\n\n.: Locandina :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://31.media.tumblr.com/e1351e75d6f09cc59cc4ca7440802c67/tumblr_mk9996vgPH1qjrbfio1_500.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://31.media.tumblr.com/e1351e75d6f09cc59cc4ca7440802c67/tumblr_mk9996vgPH1qjrbfio1_500.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList:.\n\n1. &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; 4:39\n2. &quot;Take Me with U&quot; () 3:54\n3. &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; 5:13\n4. &quot;Computer Blue&quot; 3:59\n5. &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; 4:14\n6. &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; 5:54\n7. &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; 2:49\n8. &quot;Baby I'm a Star&quot; 4:24\n9. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; 8:41","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a25a28238711c3c430f8d145ff7f0cbe9975979","amp;dn":"Prince+-+Purple+Rain+%5BMp3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a25a28238711c3c430f8d145ff7f0cbe9975979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,37,162,130,56,113,28,60,67,15,141,20,95,247,240,203,233,151,89,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
