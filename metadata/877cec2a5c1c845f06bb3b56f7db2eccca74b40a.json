But what happens when ordinary people have the same tools at their fingertips? Advances in cybertechnology, biotechnology, and robotics mean that more people than ever before have access to potentially dangerous technologiesÃ¢â‚¬â€from drones to computer networks and biological agentsÃ¢â‚¬â€which could be used to attack states and private citizens alike.\n\n In The Future of Violence, law and security experts Benjamin Wittes and Gabriella Blum detail the myriad possibilities, challenges, and enormous risks present in the modern world, and argue that if our national governments can no longer adequately protect us from harm, they will lose their legitimacy. Consequently, governments, companies, and citizens must rethink their security efforts to protect lives and liberty. In this brave new world where many little brothers are as menacing as any Big Brother, safeguarding our liberty and privacy may require strong domestic and international surveillance and regulatory controls. Maintaining security in this world where anyone can attack anyone requires a global perspective, with more multinational forces and greater action to protect (and protect against) weaker states who do not yet have the capability to police their own people. Drawing on political thinkers from Thomas Hobbes to the Founders and beyond, Wittes and Blum show that, despite recent protestations to the contrary, security and liberty are mutually supportive, and that we must embrace one to ensure the other. \n\n The Future of Violence is at once an introduction to our emerging worldÃ¢â‚¬â€one in which students can print guns with 3-D printers and scientistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ manipulations of viruses can be recreated and unleashed by ordinary peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€and an authoritative blueprint for how government must adapt in order to survive and protect us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:877cec2a5c1c845f06bb3b56f7db2eccca74b40a","amp;dn":"The+Future+of+Violence%3A+Robots+and+Germs+%282015%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"877cec2a5c1c845f06bb3b56f7db2eccca74b40a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,124,236,42,92,28,132,95,6,187,59,86,247,219,46,204,202,116,180,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
