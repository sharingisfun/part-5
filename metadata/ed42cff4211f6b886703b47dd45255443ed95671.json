The plot concerns a previously domesticated dog named Buck, whose primordial instincts return after a series of events leads to his serving as a sled dog in the Yukon during the 19th-century Klondike Gold Rush, in which sled dogs were bought at generous prices.\n\nPublished in 1903, The Call of the Wild is London's most-read book, and it is generally considered his best, the masterpiece of his so-called &quot;early period&quot;. Because the protagonist is a dog, it is sometimes classified as a juvenile novel, suitable for children, but it is dark in tone and contains numerous scenes of cruelty and violence. The Yeehat, a group of Alaska Natives portrayed in Call of the Wild, were a figment of London's imagination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed42cff4211f6b886703b47dd45255443ed95671","amp;dn":"The+Call+of+the+Wild+by+Jack+London+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed42cff4211f6b886703b47dd45255443ed95671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,66,207,244,33,31,107,136,103,3,180,125,212,82,85,68,62,217,86,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
