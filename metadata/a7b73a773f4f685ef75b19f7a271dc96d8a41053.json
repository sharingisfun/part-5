Charlotte is a young middle-class married woman having an affair with an actor. She has promised her lover she&amp;#039;ll divorce her husband, but an unplanned pregnancy makes her question that decision. The film follows her as she attempts to decide between them.\n\nLike other Godard films that followed it (Masculin/Feminin, 2 or 3 Things, Made in USA) one of the primary themes here is the extent to which a modern individual&amp;#039;s life is manipulated by commercial culture, and how it influences the choices we \nmake. Perhaps because he had yet to fully mature as a filmmaker, this theme is much less subtle here than in those later films. Charlotte is barraged with nonsensical beauty ads and Cosmo-type articles about achieving the &quot;perfect breast size,&quot; and in one famous shot is literally dwarfed by a billboard of &quot;the perfect woman&quot; in a bra. The height of social control is reached in the form of an absurd device her lover gives her that hooks around her waist like a belt and sounds an alarm every time her posture slackens. The effect of this visual over-stimulation on her is pernicious. Like the magazine ads we&amp;#039;re shown, her thoughts (heard in voice-over) are fragmented and incoherent, indecisive and ultimately meaningless.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Une Femme Mariee.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 2047 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 11.5 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.1 (build 2439/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2439/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 1917 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.259\n      StreamSize : 1.27 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 122 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 82.8 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.96r\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0058701\n\nFrench audio, no subtitles (English, German, Portuguese and Spanish subtitles available at opensubtitles.org)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7b73a773f4f685ef75b19f7a271dc96d8a41053","amp;dn":"Une+Femme+Mariee%5BA+Married+Woman%5D%281964%29+Godard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7b73a773f4f685ef75b19f7a271dc96d8a41053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,183,58,119,63,79,104,94,247,91,25,247,162,113,220,150,216,164,16,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
