The series centers around a four-year-old Daniel Tiger, son of the original Daniel Striped Tiger. Other characters include Katerina Kittycat, O the Owl, and Prince Wednesday. Two 11-minute episodes are linked by a common socio-emotional theme, such as disappointment, sadness or anger. The theme also uses a Musical Motif phrase to reenforce the theme and help children remember. The series is co-produced by The Fred Rogers Company (formerly Family Communications) and Out of the Blue Enterprises, with animation produced in Canada by 9 Story Entertainment.\t\n\nThese episodes were encoded by me, from recordings off my local PBS station. This pack contains all of the episodes that aired between July-December 2013. They don't show new episodes very often, but every time a new episode is shown I record it, and then when I have collected several in a row I post a new pack of them here. \n\nIf you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment! And please continue to seed after your download completes, so that others can enjoy this great kids educational show. If people keep seeding I will continue to post more episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec6684e9c1481ca79a16a107326f8bb56f42374","amp;dn":"Daniel+Tiger%27s+Neighborhood+%28PBS+Kids%29+S1%2C+Eps+28-34+%5BNanto%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ec6684e9c1481ca79a16a107326f8bb56f42374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,198,104,78,156,20,129,202,121,161,106,16,115,38,248,187,86,244,35,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
