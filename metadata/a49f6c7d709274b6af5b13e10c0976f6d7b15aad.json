Turn by turn, the players create a landscape by placing tiles with roads, cities, fields, and cloisters. The players deploy their followers - knights, monks, thieves, or farmers - to earn points. The player with the most points after the final scoring wins the game. The ever-changing landscape makes each game a new experience. With the official expansion &quot;The River II&quot; and 12 challenges, it never gets old. You can play against clever AI opponents or with up to 4 other players in a local multiplayer match.\nFeatures:\n- Mobile version of the award-winning tile-based board game &quot;Carcassonne&quot;\n- Includes the official expansion &quot;The River II&quot;\n- Features 12 challenges\n- Clever AI opponents with individual strategies\n- Local multiplayer mode for up to 5 players\n- Tutorial and manual for beginners\n- Language Support: English, German, French, Spanish\n\nReviews:\nPocketGamer.co.uk - Silver Award: &quot;A great adaptation of a great board game&quot;\nPlayAndroid.com - 24/30: &quot;This really is one of those must-haves that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll keep returning to, time and time and again.&quot; - &quot;I had never played the game before, but now IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m hooked.&quot;\nMeAndMyDroid.com - 4.5/5: &quot;Graphically Carcassonne is excellent for a board game and its thematic audio certainly adds atmosphere.&quot; - &quot;4.5/5 stars for a well-crafted board game&quot;\nGamezebo.com - 4/5: &quot;Carcassonne for Android is a great adaptation of the popular board game&quot;\nDroidGamers.com: &quot;If you looking for a enjoyable, easy to play, well built, inexpensive strategy game, I recommend you download Carcassonne for Android in the Market.&quot;\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a49f6c7d709274b6af5b13e10c0976f6d7b15aad","amp;dn":"Carcassonne+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a49f6c7d709274b6af5b13e10c0976f6d7b15aad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,159,108,125,112,146,116,182,175,91,19,225,12,9,118,246,215,177,90,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
