The only person she can tell is her best friend, Robinson--who she also happens to be madly in love with.\n\n   When Axi impulsively invites Robinson to come with her on an unplanned cross-country road trip, she breaks the rules for the first time in her life. But the adventure quickly turns from carefree to out-of-control...\n\n   A remarkably moving tale with its origins in James Patterson's own past, First Love is testament to the power of first love--and how it can change the rest of your life.&quot;  \n\nProduct Details: \n\n    Series: First Love\n    Hardcover: 288 pages\n    Publisher: Little, Brown and Company (January 13, 2014)\n    Language: English\n    ISBN-10: 0316207047\n    ISBN-13: 978-0316207041 \n\n[I Must Add that I Cannot Take Full Credit for Finding This EPUB Copy All on My Own, But Was Given Help By a Very Kind, Friendly Member on Mobilism.
