Much of it draws heavily on dubstep, a genre that only emerged fully in the late 2000s; &quot;Euphoria,&quot; for example, is particularly dubsteppy (with a decided emphasis on &quot;dub&quot;), as is the dancehall-flavored &quot;Get Sorted,&quot; which takes the same general structure as the preceding (and inferior) &quot;Tears in the Rain&quot; and spices it up with sharper samples and a more compelling beat. A couple of other tracks -- notably the album's witty opening track and &quot;GTI&quot; -- incorporate explicitly jungle-derived rhythms, nicely complicating the album's general texture. What are more startling are the house tracks, which truly would have sounded quite at home in an early-'90s rave, though the house/jungle/hip-hop hybrid track &quot;Pillz&quot; (an initially exciting but ultimately just tiring number) would have left more than one raver scratching his head in puzzlement. Most interesting of all is the album's final selection, &quot;U Are My Fantasy (Street Fighter II Theme Remix),&quot; which alternates house and dubstep rhythms in an excitingly disconcerting way.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c9822d0e53d4564b1850427bc4b0c4dd05009a5","amp;dn":"Zomby+-+2008+-+Where+Were+U+in+%2792+%5BV0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c9822d0e53d4564b1850427bc4b0c4dd05009a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,152,34,208,229,61,69,100,177,133,4,39,188,75,12,77,208,80,9,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
