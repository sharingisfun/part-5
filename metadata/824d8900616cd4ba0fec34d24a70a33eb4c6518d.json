Yo-jin-bo (&quot;The Bodyguards&quot;) is set in feudal Japan where the Mochizuki clan is wracked by a war of succession, and the clan princess -- a tomboy notorious for her misbehavior -- is the first target for assassination. The central storyline of Yo-jin-bo involves the princess three eccentric bodyguards attempts to save her from the sinister machinations of her would-be assassins. In the game you play the character of Sayori, a more-or-less ordinary high school student who is spending her summer vacation helping at an archaeological excavation. One day in the ruins, you happen to notice something shining half-buried in the mud. When you look more closely, you realize it is a pendant, and you pick it up . . . And thus the story begins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824d8900616cd4ba0fec34d24a70a33eb4c6518d","amp;dn":"Yo+Jin+Bo+The+Bodyguards+%5BEnglish%5D+%5BPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824d8900616cd4ba0fec34d24a70a33eb4c6518d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,77,137,0,97,108,212,186,15,236,52,210,74,112,163,62,180,198,81,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
