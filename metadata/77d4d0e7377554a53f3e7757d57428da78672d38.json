While his cousins were learning how to create the things that commoners called fairies, ghosts, golems, trolls, werewolves, and other such miracles that were the heritage of the North family, Danny worried that he would never show a talent, never form an outself.\n\nHe grew up in the rambling old house, filled with dozens of cousins, and aunts and uncles, all ruled by his father.  Their home was isolated in the mountains of western Virginia, far from town, far from schools, far from other people.\n\nThere are many secrets in the House, and many rules that Danny must follow.   There is a secret library  with only a few dozen books, and none of them in English Ã¢â‚¬â€ but Danny and his cousins are expected to become fluent in the language of the books.  While DannyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousins are free to create magic whenever they like, they must never do it where outsiders might see.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some secrets kept from Danny  as well.  And that will lead to disaster for the North family. - Goodreads Summary of The Lost Gate\n\nNote: From the same author of the Ender's Game, a great book that has some readers amazed, while other are left dazed.
