He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles.[7] The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as &quot;one of rock and rollÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest songwriters and performers&quot;.[8] He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.[9]\n\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics[10][11][12] and signature falsetto/tenor singing voice.[13][14] Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic folk and country rock, or amplified hard rock in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse. Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the &quot;Godfather of Grunge&quot;.[15]\n\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.[16]\n\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School,[17] an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he retains Canadian citizenship, having no desire to relinquish it.[18] On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba,[6] and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecade 1977\n\n\nDecade is a triple album compilation by Neil Young, released in 1977, now available on two compact discs. It contains 35 of Young's songs recorded between 1966 and 1976, among them five tracks that had been unreleased up to that point. It peaked at #43 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart.\n\nCompiled by Young himself, with his hand-written notes about each track, Decade represents almost every album from his career and various affiliations through 1977 with the exception of Four Way Street and Time Fades Away. Of the previously unreleased songs, &quot;Down to the Wire&quot; features the New Orleans pianist Dr. John with Buffalo Springfield on an item from their shelved Stampede album; &quot;Love Is a Rose&quot; was a minor hit for Linda Ronstadt in 1975; &quot;Winterlong&quot; received a cover by Pixies on the Neil Young tribute album from 1989, The Bridge; and &quot;Campaigner&quot; is a Young song critical of Richard Nixon. The track &quot;Long May You Run&quot; is a different mix to that found on the album of the same name, featuring the harmonies of the full Crosby Stills &amp; Nash before David Crosby and Graham Nash left the recording sessions.\n\nFor many years, Decade was the only Neil Young compilation album available. A 1993 compilation called Lucky Thirteen was released, but it only covered Young's 1982ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1988 output. It was not until 2004 that Reprise Records released a single-disc retrospective of his best-known tracks, titled Greatest Hits. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, Young promised fans a follow-up to the original Decade collection, provisionally titled Decade II; eventually, this idea was scrapped in favor of a much more comprehensive anthology to be titled Archives, spanning his entire career and ranging in size from a box set to an entire series of audio and/or video releases. The first release of archival material since Decade and Lucky Thirteen would appear in 2006, Live at the Fillmore East, a recording from a 1970 concert featuring Crazy Horse with Danny Whitten. Several other archival live releases followed, and in 2009 the first of several planned multi-disc box sets, The Archives Vol. 1 1963ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1972, was issued.\n\nThe album has been lauded in many quarters as one of the best examples of a career retrospective for a rock artist, and as a template for the box set collections that would follow in the 1980s and beyond. However, in the original article on Young from the first edition of the Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll and a subsequent article in the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide, critic Dave Marsh used this album to accuse Young of deliberately manufacturing a self-mythology, arguing that while his highlights could be seen to place him on a level with other artists from his generation like Bob Dylan or The Beatles, the particulars of his catalogue did not bear this out. The magazine has since excised the article from subsequent editions of the Illustrated History book; a transcription of it can be found at the link below (despite his scathing view of Young's career, Marsh gave the album the highest possible rating).\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\nDown to the Wire\nBurned\nMr Soul\nBroken Arrow\nExpecting to Fly\nSugar Mountain\nI Am a Child\nThe Loner\nThe Old Laughing Lady\nCinnamon Girl\nDown by the River\nCowgirl in the Sand\nI Believe in You\nAfter the Gold Rush\nSouthern Man\nHelpless \n\n \n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\nOhio\nSoldier\nOld Man\nA Man Needs a Maid\nHarvest\nHeart of Gold\nStar of Bethlehem\nThe Needle &amp; the Damage Done\nTonights the Night\nTired Eyes\nWalk On/For the Turnstiles\nWinterlong\nDeep Forbidden Lake\nLike a Hurricane\nLove is a Rose\nCortez the Killer\nCampaigner\nLong May You Run\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:930689b164a0265b5cbe053950c4e77b9ab689b7","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+Decade+%282+CD+Greatest+Hits%29+1977+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"930689b164a0265b5cbe053950c4e77b9ab689b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,6,137,177,100,160,38,91,92,190,5,57,80,196,231,123,154,182,137,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
