Who sent it? And why? Impossible questions, but in them lie the key to humanityâ€™s survival.\r\nNow, millions of miles away from home, a micrometeoroid storm has left us with a severely damaged ship, two deceased crew, and the sneaking suspicion this trip was doomed from the start.\r\nTharsis is a turn-based space strategy game. With dice. And cannibalism. It puts you in control of humanityâ€™s first mission to Mars, just as itâ€™s struck by a micrometeoroid storm. You must guide your crew through disasters, food shortages, and the unforgiving nature of space â€” all while maintaining your sanity amidst cryptic signals and warnings from Mars.\r\nDefy the odds, make the difficult decisions, and embark on the most important mission in human history.\r\nCommand humanity's first mission to Mars in a unique turn-based strategy experience\r\nA dynamic events system that ensures no two games of Tharsis are alike\r\nA hard mode for those of you who want your trip to Mars to be a little more... death-filled\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: 7 / 8 / 10 x64 \r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 5xxx \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: DirectX 11 compatible graphics card (Intel HD 5000, NVIDIA GeForce 400 or Radeon HD 5000)\r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nStorage: 2 GB available space\r\nMouse, Keybaord\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: 7 / 8 / 10 x64 \r\nProcessor: Intel Core i7 5xxx \r\nMemory: 6 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 6xx or Radeon HD 7xxx \r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nStorage: 2 GB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4d2a4df08318d364e83c44f0f18a8e5f3c52e38","amp;dn":"Tharsis+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4d2a4df08318d364e83c44f0f18a8e5f3c52e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,210,164,223,8,49,141,54,78,131,196,79,15,24,168,229,243,197,46,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
