It consists of members Alex Wright (keys, piano), Andrew Stavas (keys, saxophone), Brandon Corn (drums, percussion), Derek Poulsen (bass, computers) and Robert Brinkerhoff (guitar, vocals). \n\nThey self-released their first EP titled &quot;Ain't No Scary Folks In On Around Here&quot; in 2010 which has been characterized as &quot;like having your ear work on a good puzzle&quot;. \n\nTheir first single &quot;Crooked Strings&quot; received airplay on KROQ's Locals Only show. A second EP was released in 2011 titled &quot;Be Gone Dull Cage &amp; Others&quot;. \n\nThe band was named &quot;Best Indie Band&quot; at the 2011 Orange County Music Awards and is known for &quot;its intricate, eclectic music and big live sound&quot;. \n\nLos Angeles blog Buzzbands.LA describes their sound as &quot;trippy and cerebral at the same time, occupying that sometimes-exhilarating, sometimes-discomfiting space between left and right brain&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ec23702400fee644e9ef2a4c8d00e9e7d27bca2","amp;dn":"Kiev+-+Discography+%282011+-+2013%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ec23702400fee644e9ef2a4c8d00e9e7d27bca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,194,55,2,64,15,238,100,78,158,242,164,200,208,14,158,125,39,188,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
