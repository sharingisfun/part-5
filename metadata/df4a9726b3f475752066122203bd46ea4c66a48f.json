Worms Clan Wars is designed to take full advantage\n of next gen PC hardware. It features beautiful high definition 3D  visuals\n (but still retains the classic 2D gameplay) with new lighting effects, new\n features to help users interact socially, exciting  additions  to  improve\n the single player experience, and more of everything  a  Worms  fan  could\n want.\n\n Form Clans, Take On The World:\n\n Join together with friends and other Worms Clan Wars  players  to  form  a\n fearsome team; name your clan,  design  your  own  emblem,  promote  other\n players to act as leaders and officers. Enter your clan  into  the  league\n and fight together to make your mark on the leaderboards. Nobody wants  an\n empty trophy cabinet!\n\n Keep in touch with friends and foes alike using WormNET,  the  games  own\n lobby and chat system. Each clan has its own chat channel, and a number of\n other channels cater for a variety of hardcore gaming tastes! Jump  online\n to hang out, chat, recruit new members or find games.\n\n Stay connected with the game when on the  road  with  a  mobile  companion\n application (web, iOS and Android). This is the  best  online  multiplayer\n Worms ever!\n\n Slick Single Player Gameplay Too:\n\n Story  Mode  adds  a  ton  of  variety  by  introducing   physics   based\n contraptions for the first time ever. A plethora of interesting  machinery\n spices  up  the  gameplay,  and  makes  solo  Worms  much  more  fun!  The\n single-player game isnt only about dealing death  and  destruction,  its\n also  about  negotiating  tricky  swinging  rope  bridges   and   rescuing\n friendlies from death defying traps! The  player  spends  much  more  time\n playing, and much less time waiting for their  A.I.  opponent  to  take  a\n shot.\n\n\n Features:\n =========\n\n * PC Exclusive!
