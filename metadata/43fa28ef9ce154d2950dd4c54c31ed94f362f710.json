Raghda is eventually released from prison, but the family is forced to flee the country following the arrest of Sean McAllister himself. In exile, Raghda battles between being a mother or a revolutionary.\r\nFilmed over five years, this is an intimate and deeply moving portrait of a family trying to survive in exile - adapting to their new home, but missing their homeland. For Raghda and Amer, it is a journey of hope, dreams and despair: for the revolution, their homeland and each other.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9c/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/A-Syrian-Love-Story-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 23 (~1327Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1024x576\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 75 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 793 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06f146k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43fa28ef9ce154d2950dd4c54c31ed94f362f710","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+2015+A+Syrian+Love+Story+576p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43fa28ef9ce154d2950dd4c54c31ed94f362f710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,250,40,239,156,225,84,210,149,13,212,197,76,49,237,148,243,98,247,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
