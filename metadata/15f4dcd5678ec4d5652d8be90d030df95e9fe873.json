When Jesse is invited to a reunion of his old Triple-A team at a hip New York city hotel, he is forced to grapple with his memories and regrets over what might have been.\n\nJesse left more behind him than unresolved feelings about the play that ended his baseball career. The darkly sensuous Kayla, his former girlfriend and current wife of an old teammate is there in New York, too. As is KaylaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend, Dee, an otherworldly beauty with secret regrets of her own. But JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time at the reunion is cut short when, in Paradise, a young woman is found murdered and her boyfriend, a son of one of the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most prominent families, is missing and presumed kidnapped.\n\nThough seemingly coincidental, there is a connection between the reunion and the crimes back in Paradise. As Jesse, Molly, and Suit hunt for the killer and for the missing son, it becomes clear that one of JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old teammates is intimately involved in the crimes. That there are deadly forces working below the surface and just beyond the edge of their vision. Sometimes, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where the danger comes from, and where real evil lurks. Not out in the lightÃ¢â‚¬â€but in your blind spot. \n\n- - -\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF\nASIN#: B00INIXG2U\nISBN#: 0399169458\nISBN13#: 9780399169458\nPublished: September 9th, 2014\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15f4dcd5678ec4d5652d8be90d030df95e9fe873","amp;dn":"Robert+B.+Parker%27s+Blind+Spot+%28Jesse+Stone+%2313%29+-+Reed+Farrel+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15f4dcd5678ec4d5652d8be90d030df95e9fe873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,244,220,213,103,142,196,213,101,45,139,233,13,3,13,249,94,159,232,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
