We cannot find\nwords to praise Him, AS He only sees fit how laudation should be addressed to\nHim. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils within ourselves and the evils of our\nbad deeds. Whosoever Allah guides will never be led astray, and whosoever He\nleads astray will never find guidance. We bear witness that there is no god but\nAllah, the One without any associate, and We bear witness that Muhammad is\nHis Messenger and bondman, peace and blessings be upon him, his kith and kin,\nhis Companions and all those who follow their guidance until the Day of\nJudgment.\n\nThe Title: Stories Of The Quran\nFormation : Imam Ibn Kathir\nTranslation : Ali As-Sayed Al-Halawani - Ali As-Sayyed Al-Hulwani\nLanguage: English\nFormat:   PDF\nPages:    110\nSize:     362 KB\n\nShort Description: Here we are with the book Stories of the Quran by AI-Hafiz Isma` il Ibn Katheer Ad- Dimashqi (May Allah rest his soul), taking a tour throughout the stories mentioned in the Glorious QurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ an pertaining to which Allah the Almighty says: {Indeed in their stories, there is a lesson for men of understanding}.
