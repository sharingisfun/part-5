The group formed in 2003 when punk rocker Dustin Bushnell (aka Duddy B) asked his friend, rapper Jared Watson (aka Dirty J) to collaborate on a project that would focus on positive vibes and infectious grooves. Watson added singing to his vocal skills, and with percussionist Jon Olazabal joining, an acoustic-trio-version of Dirty Heads began playing shows and building an audience. They soon hooked up with producer Rob Cavallo and headed into the studio to record their debut album for Warner Bros, but differences with the label had them looking for other opportunities. Still, the band was able to retain most of its work, including sessions with drummer Josh Freese, along with the late-Beatles collaborator Billy Preston in one of the keyboardistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last recordings. The finished album, Any Port in a Storm, would arrive in 2008 with a deluxe edition following in 2010. The deluxe version featured the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lay Me DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with special guest Rome Ramirez of Sublime with Rome. The song would top BillboardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alternative Songs chart just before the summer of 2010. \n\n\nGenre................: Alternative-Rock\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Audiochecker\n\n\n01.Sound Of Change\n02.My Sweet Summer\n03.Medusa (Feat.
