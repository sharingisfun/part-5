In the practice of Chi Self-Massage, internal energy, or Chi, is manipulated to strengthen and rejuvenate the sense organs--eyes, ears, nose, tongue, teeth, and skin--and the internal organs. The Taoist techniques in this practice are more than 5,000 years old and, until very recently, were closely guarded secrets passed down from master to student with each master often knowing only a small part of the complete method.\n\nIn Chi Self-Massage Master Mantak Chia pieces together the entire system of these techniques into a logical routine, revealing the methods used by Taoist masters to maintain their youthfulness. He explains the energetic theory behind Chi Self-Massage and how negative emotions affect the organs and nervous system. By practicing the exercises outlined and following the daily routine that requires only 5 to 10 minutes to complete, readers can strengthen their senses--most notably vision, hearing, and taste--detoxify their internal organs and glands, help control negative emotions, relieve stress and constipation, and improve their complexion, teeth and gums, and overall stamina.\n\nA student of several Taoist masters, MANTAK CHIA founded the Healing Tao System in 1979. He has taught tens of thousands of students from all over the world and tours the United States annually, giving workshops and lectures. He is the director of the Tao Garden Integrative Medicine Health Spa and Resort training center in northern Thailand and is the author of 25 books, including the bestselling The Multi-Orgasmic Man and Sexual Reflexology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fdcf5fcb67922c8a70ffc1cc88fe88cc46aa19b","amp;dn":"Mantak+Chia+-+Chi+Self-Massage+-+The+Taoist+Way+of+Rejuvenation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fdcf5fcb67922c8a70ffc1cc88fe88cc46aa19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,220,245,252,182,121,34,200,167,15,252,28,200,143,232,140,196,106,161,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
