In He Comes Next, Kerner covers every angle of male sexuality, illuminates the most common sex-life ruts, and offers practical, knowledgeable answers to women's most frequently asked questions. In his role as a sex therapist, Kerner has spoken with countless men not only about the best sex they ever had, but also perhaps more important about the best sex they never had -- experiences they always desired and fantasized about, but were afraid to share with their partners. In the spirit of &quot;full exposure,&quot; He Comes Next is the closest you'll ever come to waking up in a guy's skin and knowing what truly makes him sexually tick. \n\nSexual pleasure goes beyond tips and tactics, however. Our sexual identities -- and the expression, gratification, and growth of these identities -- is fundamental to the success of our intimate relationships. With step-by-step and -- yes -- blow-by-blow detail, Kerner provides a clear, concise, achievable vision of sexual pleasure, one in which each technique forwards the action and where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. \n\nWritten in the same witty, insightful, and utterly readable voice that has made She Comes First and Be Honest -- You're Not That Into Him Either so popular, He Comes Next is the thinking woman's guide to enjoying sex to the fullest and ensuring that he does the same. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cf05b3c53acb5497ab31f0a97ee7793ba4b70aa","amp;dn":"He+Comes+Next%3A+The+Thinking+Woman%27s+Guide+to+Pleasuring+a+Man+-M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cf05b3c53acb5497ab31f0a97ee7793ba4b70aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,240,91,60,83,172,181,73,122,179,31,10,151,238,119,147,186,75,112,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
