A true storyteller and a master of gripping storylines that keep the reader hooked from beginning to end, Pearse introduces you to characters that it is impossible not to care about or forget. There is no formula to her books or easily defined genre. Whether crime as in 'Till We Meet Again', historical adventure like 'Never Look Back', or the passionately emotive 'Trust Me', based on the true-life scandal of British child migrants sent to Australia in the post war period, she engages the reader completely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66f32a8f4a0657fe1286b00d65304928dc0f0c71","amp;dn":"Lesley+Pearse+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66f32a8f4a0657fe1286b00d65304928dc0f0c71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,243,42,143,74,6,87,254,18,134,176,13,101,48,73,40,220,15,12,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
