We meet eleven-year-old Isra'a, selling black-market cigarettes so that her extended family can pay smugglers to take them across the Mediterranean on a dinghy. But as they hear stories of more and more people drowning, her father Tarek is no longer sure if he can risk his children's lives...\r\n\r\n\t---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nExodus.Our.Journey.To.Europe.s01e02.Part.2.[MPup]\r\n\r\nAhmad's journey continues in this second episode. A Syrian Kurd, he has reached Athens, and rather than take the long and uncertain overland route through Europe, he negotiates with a smuggler for a fake passport that he can use to fly to France. With his wife and young daughters trapped in Syria, time is of the essence. In Calais, his first attempt to cross the Channel almost results in suffocation in a flour tanker. But he refuses to give up on Britain.\r\n\r\n\t---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nExodus.Our.Journey.To.Europe.s01e03.Part.3.[MPup]\r\n\r\n21-year-old Alaigie is preparing to leave Gambia to travel 'the back way' 6,000 kilometres to Italy to find work. Following his father's death, Alaigie's dreams of becoming an engineer were shattered, and he needs to earn money to support his family. He films the dangerous journey through Africa via a network of smugglers, at the mercy of thieves and violent border guards, across the Sahara in overloaded trucks to Tripoli. But instead of getting on a boat as he had expected, Alaigie is kidnapped and a ransom is demanded. His family in Gambia struggle to raise the money to pay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe01c87a86e11458047ad1f0805b42639d16125","amp;dn":"Exodus.Our.Journey.To.Europe.Complete.Series.EN.SUB.x264.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe01c87a86e11458047ad1f0805b42639d16125","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,224,28,135,168,110,17,69,128,71,173,31,8,5,180,38,57,209,97,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
