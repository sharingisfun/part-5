A limited number of European appearances have been announced by Blackmore for the summer of 2016. They were originally established with Ronnie James Dio's American rock band Elf, but after the first album, Blackmore fired the backing members and continued with Dio until 1979. \r\n\r\nThree British musicians joined in 1979, singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey, former Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;. Over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. Other lead singers Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White would follow, and the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band's early work primarily featured mystical lyrics with a neoclassical metal style, but went in a more streamlined, commercial direction following Dio's departure from the group.\r\n\r\nRainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band has sold over 28 million albums worldwide.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2014\r\n\r\nStyle:\tHard Rock\r\nCountry:\tUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\n\r\nSize:\t450.00 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t01/10/2016 \r\nFiles:\t40\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength: 03:15:26\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n  \r\nCD1:\r\n\r\n01.
