The two volumes combine to give you the most up-to-date and advanced synthesis available on the subject. If you are serious about ecological gardening, ecological horticulture, permaculture design, or forest gardeningÃ¢â‚¬â€whether you are an amateur, a professional, a student, a researcher, or just a hard-core eco-freakÃ¢â‚¬â€then the two-volume set is for you. \n\nThis comprehensive two-volume book constitutes an in-depth course in ecological garden design. Written in a passionate, clear, and engaging style, it integrates the vision and ecology of forest gardening with practical design, establishment, and management strategies. While Edible Forest Gardens was written as an integrated whole, each volume can stand alone as valuable learning tools and references. Volume One begins with an overview of the ecological and cultural context for forest gardening in modern North America. It also lays out a holistic vision that guides the study of forest ecology that follows. This ecological exploration forms the bulk of Volume One, and offers clear and specific direction for forest garden design and management. Three forest garden case studies ground the concepts discussed in the book and bring them life. Volume One concludes with colorful descriptions of forest gardening's &quot;Top 100&quot; species, and useful listings of information and organizational resources. Volume Two focuses all of its attention on effective design and practice. It organizes the ecological strategies from Volume One in a way that is accessible to gardeners and designers. It offers a unique 'pattern language' for forest garden design, and provides detailed advice for how to design, prepare the site for, plant, and maintain your forest garden. Volume Two also includes a unique Plant Species Matrix and several associated appendices which offer a wide-ranging catalog of the ecology, uses, and ecosystem functions of the best temperate-climate forest garden plants, and a few edible mushrooms, from around the world.\n\nPrimary author Dave Jacke has been a student of ecology and design since the 1970s\n\nCoauthor Eric Toensmeier has studied and practiced permaculture since 1990.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5c1985fc0d7fb2209dbaf9c3e214398f03534fc","amp;dn":"Edible+Forest+Gardens+Vols+1+%26amp%3B+2%2C+by+Dave+Jacke%2C+Eric+Toensm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5c1985fc0d7fb2209dbaf9c3e214398f03534fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,193,152,95,192,215,251,34,9,219,175,156,62,33,67,152,240,53,52,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
