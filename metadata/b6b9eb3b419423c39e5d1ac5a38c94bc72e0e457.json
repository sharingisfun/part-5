But when he takes his shiny new Mercedes out for a drive, he locks horns with some of the locals, including Jasper (Josh Hartnett). As Jasper's willful girlfriend Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) looks on, Kelley and Jasper engage in a dangerous car race that turns disastrous, leaving a popular diner owned by Samantha's mother in ruins. Kelley and Jasper are sentenced to a creatively ironic but fitting punishment: They must help rebuild the diner. Not only does this ruin Kelley's summer plans, he also must board at the home of his rival, Jasper. Kelley begins to fulfill his &quot;sentence,&quot; but refuses to have anything to do with Jasper and his parents. When Kelley again encounters Samantha, the attraction is immediate and strong. First love blossoms in the Berkshire woods (&quot;a little bit of heaven, here on earth,&quot; Samantha calls the pastoral setting), angering Jasper, who has known Samantha practically his entire life. These new feelings and the romantic triangle that develops are only the beginning of a new journey for Kelley, Samantha and Jasper, as they ultimately make life-changing discoveries about themselves and each other.\n\nCast:\n\nChris Klein...Kelley\nLeelee Sobieski...Samantha\nJosh Hartnett...Jasper\nMichael Rooker...Malcolm Arnold\nAnnie Corley...Betsy Arnold\nBruce Greenwood...Earl Cavanaugh\nAnnette O'Toole...Jo Cavanaugh\n\nScreens\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img263.imageshack.us/img263/223/hereonearth000.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img263.imageshack.us/img263/223/hereonearth000.png&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img693.imageshack.us/img693/7484/hereonearth001.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img693.imageshack.us/img693/7484/hereonearth001.png&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img301.imageshack.us/img301/9430/hereonearth002.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img301.imageshack.us/img301/9430/hereonearth002.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMovie Trailer\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi1453785369/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi1453785369/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to post any comments.
