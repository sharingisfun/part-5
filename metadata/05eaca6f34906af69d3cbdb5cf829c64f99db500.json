The album although initially called Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice Live was only issued in Japan and is also known as Live in Japan. \n\nThe album is generally considered rare due to the fact of being only released in limited numbers in Japan. Live in Japan was the last released album by Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice and their only live album. Within months of the album's release the band would dissolve after Jeff Beck suddenly decided to leave the band.\n\nOf course, it's not only Jeff Beck who rocked the audience during the the show in Japan. Tim Bogert also performed his tight and dynamic bass lines excellently while Carmine Appice not only providing beats for the rest musicians but he also played dynamically to create great grooves of the songs performed. Of course, the most legendary track is Stevie Wonder's &quot;Superstition&quot;.\n\nThe album also contains renditions of songs originally recorded by the Jeff Beck Group, &quot;Plynth&quot;, &quot;Going Down,&quot; and &quot;Morning Dew&quot; and one Yardbirds number &quot;Jeff's Boogie&quot;.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1:\n01.
