Obsessed with the troubled and shameful period of the Occupation -- during which his father had allegedly engaged in shady dealings -- Modiano returns to this theme in all of his novels, book after book building a remarkably homogeneous work.  He writes constantly about the city of Paris, describing the evolution of its streets, its habits and its people.\r\n\r\nHis work is representative of what the French call autofiction, the blend of autobiography and historical fiction.  His writing style was described by one critic as &quot;so spare and elliptical that the words seem only lightly attached to the page.&quot;  Throughout his body of work, the reader can readily sense the author's perception of the unknowability of other people and the ambiguity of events; it is dark writing with a light touch.  Though they are usually set in a specific time and place, so much so that wartime Paris is almost a character in his books, Modiano's works speak a universal truth about the human condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are all in ePUB/Mobi format (three are also in PDF as indicated):\r\n\r\n* After the Circus: A Novel (Yale UP, 2015).
