Unfortunately, once the novelty and scandal began to wear off, W.A.S.P. found it difficult to expand, or even maintain, their audience by relying only on their music. Leader Blackie Lawless (bass/vocals) was already a rock &amp; roll veteran when he relocated to the West Coast and founded W.A.S.P. with guitarists Chris Holmes and Randy Piper and drummer Tony Richards. The band soon established a reputation as a ferocious live act, thanks in large part to Lawless' habits of tying a semi-naked model to a torture rack and throwing raw meat into the audience. And with the release of their self-explanatory independent EP, Animal (F**k Like a Beast), W.A.S.P. became impossible to ignore. \r\n\r\n\r\nFormat:                         Mp3\r\nAudio Quality:\t\t        Very High (Lossy)\r\nEncoder Settings:\t\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\r\nContains:\t\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tags\r\nGenre:                 \t\tHard Rock\r\nRelease Notes:          \tConverted From FLAC Files With dBpoweramp\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\r\n02.Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)\r\n03.I Wanna Be Somebody\r\n04.L.O.V.E.
