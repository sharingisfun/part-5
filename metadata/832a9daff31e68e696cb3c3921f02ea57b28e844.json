Instead, it roars with an explosive storyline that blows the doors off the series and announces that the very best has been saved for last. A familiar evil lies in wait for Lisbeth Salander, but this time, she must do more than confront the miscreants of her past; she must destroy them. Much to her chagrin, survival requires her to place a great deal of faith in journalist Mikael Blomkvist and trust his judgment when the stakes are highest. To reveal more of the plot would be criminal, as Larsson's mastery of the unexpected is why millions have fallen hard for his work. But rest assured that the odds are again stacked, the challenges personal, and the action fraught with neck-snapping revelations in this snarling conclusion to a thrilling triad. This closing chapter to The Girl's pursuit of justice is guaranteed to leave readers both satisfied and saddened once the final page has been turned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:832a9daff31e68e696cb3c3921f02ea57b28e844","amp;dn":"Larsson%2C+Stieg+-+The+Girl+Who+Kicked+the+Hornet%5C%27s+Nest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"832a9daff31e68e696cb3c3921f02ea57b28e844","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,42,157,175,243,30,104,230,150,203,60,57,33,240,46,165,123,40,232,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
