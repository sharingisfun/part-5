[two versions]\n\nThere are so very many recordings of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons; so to which version should you lend your ears. These two versions, recorded twenty years apart, both won Rosettes from the Penguin Guide, and both are favourites of yours truly.\n\nSalvatore Accardo's version with I Solisti Delle Settimane Internazionali di Napolithe was recorded for Phillips in 1987. In each of the four concertos, Accardo plays a different Stradivari violin!\n\nJoshua Bell's version with the Academy of Saint Martin in the Fields (2008) is the most eminently satisfying and civilized version (bringing fire when it should) that has come out in recent years.\n\nBoth should make you happy.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ee0942a53b82551265e935efeb9ac93b3becfdc","amp;dn":"Vivaldi+-+The+Four+Seasons+%5Btwo+versions%5D+-+Accardo%2C+Bell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ee0942a53b82551265e935efeb9ac93b3becfdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,224,148,42,83,184,37,81,38,94,147,94,254,185,172,147,179,190,207,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
