With the help of witting and unwitting accomplices in and out of government, Islamism doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t merely fuel terrorism but spawns America-hating Islamic enclaves in our very midst, gradually foisting IslamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repressive law, sharia, on American life. The revolutionary doctrine has made common cause with an ascendant Left that also seeks radical transformation of our constitutional order. The prognosis for liberty could not be more dire.\n\nIn The Grand Jihad: How Islam and the Left Sabotage America, bestselling author Andrew C.
