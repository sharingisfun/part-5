Oftentimes artists will have to do this to increase sales. Look at how much New Age recluse Enya has popularized her once arcane, Celtic-spirited style. However, I think that Ms. MacLachlan has lost little if any of her iconic individuality with this release. It's not as if Delilah had slain Sappho, so to speak.\n\nOf course, we cannot keep Sugar Ray fans from singing along when &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; or &quot;Angel&quot; plays on the radio. But there is enough depth to her lyrics, as always, to keep the more emotionally/soulfully attuned listener satisfied. In songs like &quot;Adia,&quot; for example, MacLachlan makes the most of her gifted voice range and lyrical sensitivity. I feel that this is one of her best recordings to date, and I look forward to more music of this kind.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c1e38bbced22bdf029e8051c6f7b7c07c3dd76b","amp;dn":"Sarah+McLachlan+-+Surfacing+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1997+Adult+Alterna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c1e38bbced22bdf029e8051c6f7b7c07c3dd76b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,30,56,187,206,210,43,223,2,158,128,81,198,247,183,192,124,61,215,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
