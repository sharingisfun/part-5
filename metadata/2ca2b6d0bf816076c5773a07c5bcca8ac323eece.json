He may have changed his name to become Pope Francis, but it did not change their friendship.\r\n\r\nSince Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope Francis in 2013, countless books have been written to help the world understand this deeply complex yet simple servant of God. What sets Pope Francis: Life and Revolution apart from all other biographies of Pope Francis is the careful research and original investigation behind it, along with the fact that it is written by an internationally respected journalistâ€”Elisabetta PiquÃ©â€”who has remained close to the Pope since first meeting him back in 2001.\r\n\r\nOver 75 individuals were interviewed for Pope Francis: Life and Revolution, including lay people, priests, bishops, and cardinals who have known or worked with Francis at various times in his life. Insights from these people, as well as from friends and family members, allow us to see a profoundly personal side of the Pope. His humility and humanity, courage and conviction, and warmth and wisdom are revealed as PiquÃ© shares little-known episodes from Francisâ€™s life.\r\n\r\nWith a foreword by Cardinal SeÃ¡n Oâ€™Malley, O.F.M. Cap., Pope Francis: Life and Revolution is the definitive resource and narrative of a man personally known by few and revered and respected by many.\r\n\r\nPope Francis: Life and Revolution reveals a man consistent in his beliefs and actions. He is a spiritual leader unwavering in his love for God, whose inner joy and peace move himâ€”and can inspire usâ€”to serve the least, the last, and the lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease seed!\r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/catholicstuff/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ca2b6d0bf816076c5773a07c5bcca8ac323eece","amp;dn":"Pope+Francis%3A+Life+and+Revolution+A+Biography+of+Jorge+Bergoglio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ca2b6d0bf816076c5773a07c5bcca8ac323eece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,162,182,208,191,129,96,118,197,119,58,7,197,188,202,138,195,35,238,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
