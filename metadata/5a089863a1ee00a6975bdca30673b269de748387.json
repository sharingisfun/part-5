He worked for a while as a studio player and songwriter, and had his first hit in 1986 with the stirring and philosophical &quot;The Way It Is.&quot; After that, he continued to release albums that honored his own muse rather than the marketplace, and put together various backing bands to suit the mood and style of the genres he works in. Hornsby has also maintained a close musical relationship with the remaining members of the Grateful Dead, having toured as a temporary member in the early '90s and collaborated on offshoot recordings and live shows. \n\n\nGenre................: Pop\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: RCA/Legacy\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.The Way It Is\n02.The Valley Road\n03.Across The River\n04.Talk Of The Town (Edit)\n05.Rainbow's Cadillac\n06.White Wheeled Limousine\n07.Resting Place\n08.Preacher In The Ring (Part 1)\n09.Shadowland\n10.Try Anything Once\n11.Halcyon Days\n12.Song F\n13.The Dreaded Spoon\n14.A Night On The Town\n15.Camp Meeting\n16.The Black Rats Of London\n17.Song E (Hymn In EB)\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Mandolin Rain (Live) (Previously Unreleased)\n02.End Of The Innocence (Live) (Previously Unreleased)\n03.Lost Soul\n04.Jack Straw\n05.Country Doctor (Live)\n06.Spider Fingers (Live)\n07.Hop, Skip And Jump\n08.Fortunate Son/Comfortably Numb (Live)\n09.Gonna Be Some Changes Made (Edit)\n10.Levitate\n11.Darling Corey (Live)\n12.Cyclone\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a089863a1ee00a6975bdca30673b269de748387","amp;dn":"Bruce+Hornsby+-+The+Essential+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a089863a1ee00a6975bdca30673b269de748387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,8,152,99,161,238,0,166,151,91,220,163,6,115,178,105,222,116,131,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
