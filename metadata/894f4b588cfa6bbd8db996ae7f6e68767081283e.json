More songs that can be put on this single-disc set, unfortunately. While many of Seger's trademarks are here Ã¢â‚¬â€ &amp;quot;Turn the Page,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Old Time Rock N' Roll,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Night Moves&amp;quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ there is no &amp;quot;Rock and Roll Never Forgets,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Katmandu,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Shame on the Moon,&amp;quot; or any of his pulverizing early records, when he was as tough as fellow Michigan rockers the MC5 and the Stooges; this is one time when a double-disc set would have held enough quality material. Nevertheless, what is here is fine and contains enough first-rate material to satisfy most fans. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894f4b588cfa6bbd8db996ae7f6e68767081283e","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger+-+Greatest+Hits+%40256+and+covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894f4b588cfa6bbd8db996ae7f6e68767081283e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,79,75,88,140,250,107,189,141,185,150,174,127,110,104,118,112,129,40,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
