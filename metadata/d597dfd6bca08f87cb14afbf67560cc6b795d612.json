PC, Mac and Linux versions included.\n\nGame synopsis:\nThe Flower Shop is a dating and farming simulation game.\nSteve's life has just taken a downward turn. His grades from his first semester in college are dismal, his relationship with his girlfriend is rocky at best, and now his dad is shipping him off to some farm for the summer so that he can &quot;build character.&quot; What's a poor, lazy, college kid to do?\nTake control of Steve as he spends a summer in Fairbook, working on the farm, making new friends, and maintaining old relationships.\nYou can raise and sell your own crops, but you'll have to work hard to keep your land well watered and free of weeds and insects, or your crops will fail. Stop by the flower shop to buy more seeds, but choose wisely. Some plants take longer to mature, and some crops will get you a better return at the market.\n\nThere are four girls who you can spend time with. Maintain a good relationship with them by spending time with them and learning about their hopes and dreams. You can impress Raszz by improving your skills, but if you only focus on one thing, they won't be interested. Build a strong enough friendship, and it might even bloom into romance.\nYou can plan your weeks and who you spend time with using the weekly scheduler. Customize each week, spend time with who you like, or ignore everyone and work all day. Don't forget to take a break once in a while, or your health will suffer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d597dfd6bca08f87cb14afbf67560cc6b795d612","amp;dn":"The+Flower+Shop+%7C+PC+%7C+MAC+%7C+LINUX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d597dfd6bca08f87cb14afbf67560cc6b795d612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,151,223,214,188,160,143,135,203,20,175,191,103,86,12,198,183,149,214,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
