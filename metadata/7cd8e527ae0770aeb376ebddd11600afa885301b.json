Produced in collaboration with Mitchell Froom, Kiko exchanged the more straightforward approach of Los LobosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ previous sessions for a uniquely textured sound, with the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitars thrown into sharp relief against FroomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collection of vintage tape-loop keyboards, and the arrangements are often unusually spare, most powerfully in the ghostly spaciousness of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kiko and the Lavender MoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wake Up Delores.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Even the more full-bodied cuts, such as the rollicking Ã¢â‚¬Å“That Train DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Stop HereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nand the hard-rocking Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whiskey Trail,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ boast a different personality than in Los LobosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ previous work, with the guitars clean but cutting like a switchblade and the drums snapping hard, and the more contemplative selections drip with a mysterious, otherworldly ambience thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s matched by the impressionistic imagery of David Hidalgo and Louie PÃƒÂ©rezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superb songs. At its best, Kiko sounds like the musical equivalent of a Luis BuÃƒÂ±uel dream sequence, balancing beauty and menace with intelligence and a skill thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little short of dazzling; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a brilliant, singular achievement, and the most rewarding album in the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catalog.\n\nMastered from original master tapes, Mobile FidelityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hybrid SACD version of Kiko presents the record in previously unimaginable fidelity. In particular, FroomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exquisite production can now be experienced in full relief, with the vintage tape-loop keyboards and spare arrangements yielding an ethereal feel, otherworldly ambience, and colorful finish that complement the ace playing. The subtleties of the richly detailed backdrops-splashed with distortion, feedback, random sound effects, sonorous horns, ominous chants, delicately plucked harps Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are greatly enhanced, turning the multifaceted Kiko into the aural equivalent of a sensational IMAX presentation.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd8e527ae0770aeb376ebddd11600afa885301b","amp;dn":"Los+Lobos+-+Kiko+%282014%29+MFSL+SACD+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cd8e527ae0770aeb376ebddd11600afa885301b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,216,229,39,174,7,112,174,179,118,235,221,209,22,0,175,168,133,48,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
