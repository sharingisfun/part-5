Batman's duties have multiplied in recent weeks as a series of unusually gruesome attacks have left at least one mutilated body floating in the sewer and have kept Julie waiting impatiently for Bruce. And of course, loan shark and mob boss Sal Maroni continues to wreak havoc among his clients. In cooperation with Captain Jim Gordon at Gotham PD, Batman gets the evidence he needs to discover the source of the vicious attacks; genetically mutated monsters created by renegade Professor Hugo Strange, a man with a Napoleon complex and money on loan from Sal Maroni. When Julie's father becomes entangled with Maroni, Bruce's emotional investment rises, and Batman must do everything in his power to bring down Maroni.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND COMMENT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d832804ce2e794d2c757d31e8b8b84f6aa3eafc","amp;dn":"Batman+and+the+Monster+Men++1-+6+%28of+06%29+%282006%29+Complete-%3DSPIDAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d832804ce2e794d2c757d31e8b8b84f6aa3eafc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,131,40,4,206,46,121,77,44,117,125,49,232,184,184,79,106,163,234,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
