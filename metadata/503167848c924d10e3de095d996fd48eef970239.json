Polo eventually pushes bravely forth alone toward the fabled country where he is accepted as an envoy into Khan&amp;#039;s court. Marooned on the far side of the world, Polo, accompanied by his servant, Pedro (B.D. Wong, &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot;), advances as a Mongol grandee for 20 extraordinary years. What he eventually brings back with him to the West is a chronicle that changed history forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503167848c924d10e3de095d996fd48eef970239","amp;dn":"Marco.Polo.2007.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503167848c924d10e3de095d996fd48eef970239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,49,103,132,140,146,77,16,227,222,9,93,153,111,212,142,239,151,2,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
