I just read Noam Chomsky's book about September 11th (called &quot;9-11&quot;) and I was really interested in learning more. I saw this film on TV and I was amazed at the man's ability to recall facts and figures from articles, interviews, etc. He really is one of the smartest speakers in the world today. His wife, Carol actually steals the show as she explains what it's like to live with such a mind. Interesting tidbits from Carol was that Noam reads 6 newspapers a day and over 80 journals every year. The fact that he's really into his grandchildren and to meeting with students and talking about the issues made me see him more as a grandfather than a radical intellectual. The reflections and insights from others in the film are equally revealing. It becomes clear that Chomsky has influenced successive generations of people and still exerts enormous influence in the world today. There is so much interesting bits from Chomsky on so many issues I am hoping to either see it on TV again or in the theatres or on video so I can pay more attention to what he's talking about. Try and get it at your local video store that specializes in non-Hollywood blockbuster films and prepare to be challenged by Chomsky and his ideas. \n\n\nOther torrents by smartypants\n\nManufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the Media\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3357695\n\nDocumentary collection\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3356227\n\nSpaced - TV-Series\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3352439\n\nTool - Parabola\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3347750\n\nBaraka\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3347042\n\nSpellbound\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3347022\n\nBuffalo Soldiers\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3347018\n\nBest Regards\n-smartypants-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38f9ac58df379813e60fad67ad356141d1651ed9","amp;dn":"Noam.Chomsky.-.Rebel.Without.A.Pause.-.DVDrip.%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38f9ac58df379813e60fad67ad356141d1651ed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,249,172,88,223,55,152,19,230,15,173,103,173,53,97,65,209,101,30,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
