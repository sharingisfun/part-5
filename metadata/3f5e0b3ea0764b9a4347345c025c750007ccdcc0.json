Originally published in 1987, The Book of Questions, a New York Times bestseller, has been completely revised and updated to incorporate the myriad cultural shifts and hot-button issues of the past twenty-five years, making it current and even more appealing.\n\nThis is a book for personal growth, a tool for deepening relationships, a lively conversation starter for the family dinner table, a fun way to pass the time in the car. It poses over 300 questions that invite people to explore the most fascinating of subjects: themselves and how they really feel about the world.\n\nThe revised edition includes more than 100 all-new questions that delve into such topics as the disappearing border between man and machine--How would you react if you learned that a sad and beautiful poem that touched you deeply had been written by a computer? The challenges of being a parent--Would you completely rewrite your child's college-application essays if it would help him get into a better school? The never-endingly interesting topic of sex--Would you be willing to give up sex for a year if you knew it would give you a much deeper sense of peace than you now have? And of course the meaning of it all--If you were handed an envelope with the date of your death inside, and you knew you could do nothing to alter your fate, would you look?\n\nThe Book of Questions may be the only publication that challenges--and even changes--the way you view the world, without offering a single opinion of its own.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;The best questions are the ones you can't Google. Here is a whole book of them.&quot;\n--Austin Kleon, author of Steal Like an Artist\n\n&quot;In a good question is the thread of an answer. A good question is better than a brilliant answer. I personally focus on the word 'quest' in question, which is the essence of each interlocutory. Gregory Stock's book is a seductive and delightful journey about the essence of conversations which is the question.&quot;\n--Richard Saul Wurman, creator of TED\n\n&quot;Capturing both future and present dilemmas, this deceptively simple book packs a real punch.&quot;\n--Ray Kurzweil, author of How to Create a Mind and founder of Singularity University\n\n&quot;These questions can take you into critical examination of what you are doing in this life.&quot;\n--Robert Thurman, professor of Buddhist studies, Columbia University\n\n&quot;Interesting questions! Some of the most bizarre ones may be everyday issues in our near future.&quot;\n--Vernor Vinge, author of Marooned in Real Time\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author/s:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGregory Stock is a biophysicist, bestselling author, biotech entrepreneur, and the former director of the Program on Medicine, Technology, and Society at UCLA's School of Medicine.
