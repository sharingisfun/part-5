It was recorded on VHS tape at that time. As far as I know -- that is the only way to get the full length as it was released only two-hours. Yes, that means you are missing one hour (33%) when you purchase the released versions. Get this one and you'll not want to watch the released edited cut-up version again even if it is a better resolution. Too bad the released DVDs are reduced to only 2 hours. I am sure you will agree that the extra hour makes this a much better really great classic.\r\n\r\nRuntime: 3 hrs 4 min (184 minutes)\r\nFormat: mp4\r\nSize: 2.1 GB\r\nFrame Width: 720\r\nFrame Height: 540\r\nFrame Rate: 29\r\nData Rate 14499 kbps\r\nTotal bitrate: 1627 kbps\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nPogo1876","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ff7c181ef764dda4091f49ea642e34465766fad","amp;dn":"Needful+Things+1993+Steven+King+Original+3hrs+Full+Length+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ff7c181ef764dda4091f49ea642e34465766fad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,247,193,129,239,118,77,218,64,145,244,158,166,66,227,68,101,118,111,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
