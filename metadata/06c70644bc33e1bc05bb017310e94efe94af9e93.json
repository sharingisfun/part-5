This way you can achieve almost invisible compression for your most demanding mastering sessions, when you want to avoid coloration.\n\nIf you aim for colour you can choose between two saturation models.\nFrom opto style, peak compression, external sidechaining, RMS compression, Feedback, Feedforward compression (and everything inbetween) to negative ratios, zero latency brickwall limiting, from snappy transient treatment to smooth transient rounding - everything is possible.\n\n\n\nChangeLog\n\n\nFIX: overs in LIMITER mode under some circumstances.\nCHANGE: feedback signal is grabbed before the output control now: so increasing output gain doesn't lead to more gain reduction, when feedback is used for the detector (FB-MIX &gt; 0 and EASY modes).\nCHANGE: updated feedback path to avoid &quot;clickiness&quot; at very short attack times and and heavy gain reduction.\nCHANGE: when using the mix control the dry mix signal is the unprocessed signal without input and output gain and without saturation.\nCHANGE: negative release PROG DEP is now possible in SMASH mode too making release times down to 2ms possible on extreme settings and high GR.\nFIX/CHANGE: attack PROG DEP is working as expected now, it's been completely rewritten and detached from the release PROG DEP. So it's easier to use both attack and release PROG DEP at the same time.\nCHANGE: internal timings of oversampled and non-oversampled operation are aligned now.\n\n\n\n\n\nDC8C is available in the following formats:\n\nWindows: VST (32&amp;64Bit), VST3 (32&amp;64Bit), RTAS\n\nMac OSX: AU (32&amp;64Bit), VST (32&amp;64Bit), VST3 (32&amp;64Bit)\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  You need WinRar or other extractor of your choise to extract the rar file\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  For the VST the dirs of vst, vst3 RTAS\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
