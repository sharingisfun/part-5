Everything about these torrents is done for a reason, not without thought.  The RAR file naming convention is purposely to evade DMCA crawlers.\r\n\r\nThese torrents are an expression of appreciation to the NERDs for making all these wonderful ebooks available, providing missing and broken files as needed and giving me their blessing to redistribute them here.\r\n\r\nEither youâ€™re familiar with NERDs ebooks and delighted at the opportunity to back fill your collection, or youâ€™re lucky enough to discover them now while theyâ€™re still available, or you can whine and complain and miss the boat. Your choice.\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\nPS. Thanks to everyone for all the nice comments and feedback on earlier torrents and a special thanks to everyone that has contributed their bandwidth and resources to help seed.  Another special thanks to all the Nerds for all their hard work creating and releasing these daily RAR packs.\r\n\r\n          ------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTO COMBINE YOUR INDIVIDUAL MONTH TORRENTS INTO A FULL YEAR TORRENT:\r\n\r\n1 Download this yearly magnet or torrent and then stop it.\r\n2 Stop all of the monthly torrents for that year, complete and incomplete.\r\n3 In Windows explorer, move the JAN thru DEC RAR files from the monthly torrent folders into this ALL for year torrent folder, overwriting.\r\n4 Force a recheck of the new torrent, it should now be greater than 0%\r\n5 Queue it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99bef2a2db21d1ece7e73d2213ab1f3116382a02","amp;dn":"New+ebook+packs+for+ALL+of+2015+Part+2+%26amp%3B+Missing+Packs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99bef2a2db21d1ece7e73d2213ab1f3116382a02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,190,242,162,219,33,209,236,231,231,61,34,19,171,31,49,22,56,42,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
