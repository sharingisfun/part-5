The piano is prepared when &quot;preparations&quot; (consisting of nearly any conceivably applicable object or material) are inserted between the strings or onto the hammers of the instrument; a wider application of the term takes in all manner of additional modifications that expand the sonic and operative possibilities of the piano. Hauschka has successfully combined the chamber music aspect of prepared piano (see composers Henry Cowell, John Cage, Christian Wolff, Max Richter, Maurice Delage, and Arvo PÃƒÂ¤rt) with pop, rock, and electronic sensibilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2239fdfc19b68ba9e3e67311052356798bb0ed17","amp;dn":"Hauschka+-+Abandoned+City+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2239fdfc19b68ba9e3e67311052356798bb0ed17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,57,253,252,25,182,139,169,227,230,115,17,5,35,86,121,139,176,237,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
