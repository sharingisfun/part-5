RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can. WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives. It can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.\nWinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries\n\nFeatures of WinRAR:\n- Using WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression by consistently making smaller archives than the competition, saving disk space and transmission costs.\n- WinRAR provides complete support for RAR and ZIP archives and is able to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z archives.\n- WinRAR offers a graphic interactive interface utilizing mouse and menus as well as the command line interface.\n- WinRAR is easier to use than many other archivers with the inclusion of a special &quot;Wizard&quot; mode which allows instant access to the basic archiving functions through a simple question and answer procedure. This avoids confusion in the early stages of use.\n- WinRAR offers you the benefit of industry strength archive encryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key of 128 bits.\n- WinRAR supports files and archives up to 8,589 billion gigabytes in size. The number of archived files is, for all practical purposes, unlimited.\n- WinRAR offers the ability to create selfextracting and multivolume archives.\nRecovery record and recovery volumes allow to reconstruct even physically damaged archives.\n- WinRAR features are constantly being developed to keep WinRAR ahead of the pack.\n\nVersion 4.00 beta 1:\n1. RAR decompression speed is improved. Depending on data type,\ndecompression can be up to 30% faster than in previous versions.\n\nBoth the general RAR algorithm and most of special RAR multimedia\nmethods benefit from this improvement. The only module of RAR\nalgorithm, which is not affected, is &quot;Text compression&quot; method.\n\n2. Changes in ISO support:\n\na) UDF support is upgraded to UDF 2.50 revision. It makes possible\nto unpack most of Blue-ray ISO files;\n\nb) when browsing UDF ISO file, UDF revision number is displayed\nafter the &quot;UDF&quot; format name in WinRAR address bar\nand in archive information dialog;\n\nc) WinRAR sets the folder modification date when unpacking folders\nstored in UDF and ISO9660 files.\n\n3. Changes in password dialog:\n\na) WinRAR uses the same format of password dialog both when archiving\nand extracting, so &quot;Show password&quot; option is available also\nwhen extracting;\n\nb) &quot;Organize passwords...&quot; button in password dialog provides\naccess to password organizer interface, where you can specify\nyour frequently used passwords. You will be able to access these\nsaved passwords using the drop down list or autocomplete feature\nin password dialog.\n\nIt is important to know that saved passwords are not encrypted\nand anybody having access to your computer can view them.\nUse &quot;Organize passwords&quot; feature only if your computer is\nprotected from unauthorized access;\n\nc) &quot;Use for all archives&quot; option is available in password dialog\nwhen unpacking several archives at once. You can utilize it\nto apply an entered password to all archives.\n\nIf you use this option with an empty password, WinRAR will skip\nall encrypted archives.\n\n4. In Windows 7 WinRAR will display the total operation progress\nalso on WinRAR icon on Windows taskbar. You can disable it using\n&quot;Taskbar progress bar&quot; option on &quot;General&quot; page of WinRAR settings.\n\n5. Numerous Unicode support improvements allow to process non-English\nfile names more smoothly. These improvements include:\n\na) better Unicode handling in WinRAR in &quot;Rename&quot;, &quot;Convert&quot;,\n&quot;Find&quot; and other commands, in folder tree panel, in password\nrequest dialog and in many other parts of WinRAR interface;\n\nb) correctly displayed Unicode names in WinRAR items in Explorer\ncontext menus;\n\nc) Unicode support in .lng files, making WinRAR localization\npossible for Unicode only languages.\n\n6. Changes in -x switch syntax. Now you can specify a wildcard\nexclusion mask for folders. Such mask must have the trailing ''\ncharacter, like -x*tmp* or -x*temp\n\n7. New &quot;Extract relative paths&quot; option in &quot;Advanced&quot; part of extraction\ndialog. If you browse some archive subfolder in WinRAR shell\nand enable &quot;Extract relative paths&quot; option, the path part up to\nand including the current subfolder will be removed from extracted\nfile paths.\n\nFor example, if you are inside of &quot;BackupMyData&quot; archive folder\nand extract &quot;Images&quot; folder, it will be extracted as &quot;Images&quot;,\nnot as &quot;BackupMyDataImages&quot;.\n\nThis option is the new default extraction mode, but you can change\nthe default back to WinRAR 3.x style. Just select &quot;Extract full paths&quot;\nand then press &quot;Save settings&quot; in &quot;General&quot; part of extraction dialog.\n\n8. Windows 98, Windows Me and Windows NT are not supported by WinRAR\nand WinRAR self-extracting modules anymore. Minimum Windows version\nrequired for WinRAR 4.0 is Windows 2000.\n\nIf you need to run WinRAR on older Windows, you can download\nprevious WinRAR versions from ftp://ftp.rarlab.com/rar\n\n9. If TAR, TAR.GZ or TAR.BZ2 archive contains symbolic or hard links\nand if destination file system is NTFS, WinRAR will create these\nlinks when unpacking such archive. WinRAR will create symbolic links\nas symbolic and hard links as hard in Windows Vista and newer\nand it will create all links as hard in older Windows.\n\nIf destination file system is FAT32 or any other not supporting\nfile links, WinRAR will skip links when unpacking TAR, TAR.GZ\nand TAR.BZ2 archives.\n\n10. Recovery volume processing involves less disk seek operations\nresulting in higher performance.\n\n11. You can select Windows 7 library in tree panel in extraction dialog\nand WinRAR will use its default save location as the destination path.\n\n12. &quot;Report&quot; command allows to select HTML, Unicode text and usual text\nas output format for report file. Unlike previous WinRAR versions,\nnow WinRAR preservers Unicode characters in reports when using HTML\nor Unicode text format. So non-English characters in file names\nwill be displayed properly in such reports.\n\n13. Message list in GUI SFX archives displays only operation status\nand error messages. It does not contain names of all extracted files\nanymore. This change improves the speed and reduces memory requirements\nfor SFX archives containing a large number of files. Also it makes\neasier to locate error messages, because they are not hidden among\nextracted file names.\n\n14. GUI SFX archives display &quot;Extract&quot; button instead of &quot;Install&quot;\nif no &quot;Setup&quot; or &quot;Presetup&quot; commands are present in the archive\ncomment. If you prefer &quot;Install&quot; button, but do not need to\nexecute any setup programs, you can add &quot;Setup&quot; command\nwithout any parameters.\n\n15. WinRAR displays the current percent above the operation progress bar\nwhen repairing an archive containing the recovery record\nand when processing recovery volumes.\n\n16. WinRAR limits the maximum possible volume size to 4 GB minus 1 byte\nwhen creating RAR volumes on a disk with FAT or FAT32 file system\nin volume size autodetecting mode. These file systems do not support\n4 GB and larger files.\n\n17. If &quot;Wait if other WinRAR copies are active&quot; option is enabled\nand WinRAR waits for another copy, you can press &quot;Continue&quot; button\nin command progress window to force WinRAR to stop waiting.\nSo now &quot;Continue&quot; button allows to override the state of\n&quot;Wait if other WinRAR copies are active&quot; option for current operation.\n\n18. WinRAR displays one password request instead of two, when saving\nan encrypted file back to RAR or ZIP archive after modifying it\nin some external editor. Previous WinRAR versions usually requested\nthe password twice, both when extracting the original file\nand archiving its modified copy. Only RAR archives with encrypted\nfile names were processed with the single password prompt.\n\n19. New error code 10 (&quot;no files&quot;) is added to list of error codes\nreturned in command line mode by RAR and WinRAR. This new code\ncan be returned by archive, extract, delete and repair commands.\nIt means that RAR did not find any files matched the specified\nfile or archive mask.\n\n20. File name area in file overwrite dialog occupies several lines now.\nIt makes possible to display much longer names.\n\n21. Bugs fixed:\n\na) renaming a file in archive could also rename all other files\nwith the same name in other folders of the same archive;\n\nb) previous versions displayed the wrong total packed size\nin &quot;Info&quot; command for multivolume CAB archives;\n\nc) in ZIP archives 'U' (update) and 'F' (fresh) commands could\nerroneously update even files not specified in the command line.\nIt happened only for files in current folder which names matched\nfiles in ZIP archive. This bug was not present in usual 'A' (add)\narchiving mode.\n\nINSTALL NOTES:\n- Install the program do not start\n- Copy the file 'rarreg.key' to the main program directory\n- The default directory is C: / Program Files / WinRAR\n- Run program\n\n\nScreenshot:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/25000/24130.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/25000/24130.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392c82c01db9d5d1c3117b35bfbea5e40e611d1b","amp;dn":"WinRAR+4.00+Beta+1+32bit+%26amp%3B+64bit+%2B+rarreg.key+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392c82c01db9d5d1c3117b35bfbea5e40e611d1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,44,130,192,29,185,213,209,195,17,123,53,191,190,165,228,14,97,29,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
