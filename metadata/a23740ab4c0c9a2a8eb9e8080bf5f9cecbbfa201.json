The draw for devotees is four rare songs from a 2001 session, including\na hilarious fan letter to kindred indie-pop intellectuals the Go-Betweens\n(&quot;Shoot the Sexual Athlete&quot;) and a kind of hushed farewell sung by Isobel\nCampbell, who left the group soon after (&quot;Nothing in the Silence&quot;). Otherwise,\naside from a breezy glockenspiel revision of &quot;Lazy Line Painter Jane,&quot; these\nversions are pretty close to the studio originals. But the selection is so good,\nthe set doubles as a best-of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it&amp;#039;s a fine intro to the group&amp;#039;s tuneful world of\nlovelorn geekdom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a23740ab4c0c9a2a8eb9e8080bf5f9cecbbfa201","amp;dn":"Belle+And+Sebastian+-+The+BBC+Session+%282008%29+%5B2CD%5D+%5Bmp3%40164%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a23740ab4c0c9a2a8eb9e8080bf5f9cecbbfa201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,55,64,171,76,12,154,42,142,185,232,8,11,245,249,206,203,191,162,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
