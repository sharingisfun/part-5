In the winter of 1975-1976, when he cut No Reason to Cry at the Band's Shangri-La Studio in Malibu, California, he came as close as he ever would to realizing that desire. Clapton is a musical chameleon; though some of No Reason to Cry is identifiable as the kind of pop/rock Clapton had been making since the start of his solo career (the best of it being &quot;Hello Old Friend,&quot; which became his first Top 40 single in two years), the most memorable music on the album occurs when Clapton is collaborating with members of the Band and other guests. He duets with Band bassist Rick Danko on Danko's &quot;All Our Past Times,&quot; and with Bob Dylan on Dylan's &quot;Sign Language,&quot; as Robertson's distinctive lead guitar is heard rather than Clapton's.
