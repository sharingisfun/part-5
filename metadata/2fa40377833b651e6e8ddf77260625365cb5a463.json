Although\nthe comic outlived the animated series by a number of years, it\nwas the animated series that truly captured the hearts and minds\nof fans worldwide. In 1986, the series gave birth to a\nfeature-length animated film, The TransformersÃ‚Â«: The Movie, which\nfeatured the voices of Eric Idle, Leonard Nimoy and Orson Welles\namong others. The 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION CD of the original\nsoundtrack from The TransformersÃ‚Â«: The Movie features all of the\nmusic from the original soundtrack album plus bonus material\nprovided by the composer and producer of the filmÃƒâ€ s score, Vince\nDiCola.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fa40377833b651e6e8ddf77260625365cb5a463","amp;dn":"VA-The_Transformers-The_Movie-%2820th_Anniversary_Edition%29-OST-200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fa40377833b651e6e8ddf77260625365cb5a463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,164,3,119,131,59,101,30,110,141,223,119,38,6,37,54,92,181,164,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
