As the daughter of missionaries, Buck spent most of her life before 1934 in China. Her novel The Good Earth was the best-selling fiction book in the U.S. in 1931 and 1932 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. In 1938, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces.&quot;\n\nIn her speech to the Academy, she took as her topic &quot;The Chinese Novel.&quot; She explained: &quot;I am an American by birth and by ancestry,&quot; but went on to say &quot;My earliest knowledge of story, of how to tell and write stories, came to me in China.&quot; After an extensive discussion of classic Chinese novels, especially Romance of Three Kingdoms, All Men Are Brothers, and Dream of the Red Chamber, she concluded that in China, &quot;the novelist did not have the task of creating art but of speaking to the people.&quot; Her own ambition, she continued, had not been trained toward &quot;the beauty of letters or the grace of art.&quot; In China, the task of the novelist differed from the western artist: &quot;to farmers he must talk of their land, and to old men he must speak of peace, and to old women he must tell of their children, and to young men and women he must speak of each other.&quot; And like the Chinese novelist, she concluded, &quot;I have been taught to want to write for these people. If they are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\nNon-Fiction\n\n* A Bridge for Passing - Autobiography (1962) \n\n* The Child Who Never Grew - A Memoir (1950) \n\n* Nobel Lecture: The Chinese Novel (nepalifiction, 2014)\n\n\nFiction\n\n* Come, My Beloved (1953) \n\n* Death in the Castle (1965)\n\n* Dragon Seed (1942)\n\n* East Wind:West Wind (1930)\n\n* God's Men (1951)\n\n* Imperial Woman (1956)\n\n* Kinfolk (1950)\n\n* Letter from Peking (1957)\n\n* Peony (1948)\n\n* The Angry Wife (1947)\n\n* The Big Wave (1948)\n\n* The Eternal Wonder (2013)\n\n* The Goddess Abides (1972)\n\n* The House of Earth\n \n    -  The Good Earth (1931)\n\n    -  Sons (1933)\n\n    -  A House Divided (1935)\n\n* The Living Reed (1963)\n\n* The Mother (1933)\n\n* The Patriot (1939)\n\n* The Promise (1943)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_S._Buck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_S._Buck&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.visitbuckscounty.com/listings/Pearl-S-Buck-House-Historic-Site/1665/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.visitbuckscounty.com/listings/Pearl-S-Buck-House-Historic-Site/1665/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/business/media/a-pearl-buck-novel-new-after-4-decades.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/business/media/a-pearl-buck-novel-new-after-4-decades.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2256cb082f61211a0b545f489fae8266f27ded73","amp;dn":"Pearl+S.+Buck+-+Fiction+%26amp%3B+Non-Fiction+%2823+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2256cb082f61211a0b545f489fae8266f27ded73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,86,203,8,47,97,33,26,11,84,95,72,159,174,130,102,242,125,237,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
