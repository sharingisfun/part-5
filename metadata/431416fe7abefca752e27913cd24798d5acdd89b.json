Rupert Everett uncovers the real story of the sex industry, going behind the stereotypes to hear the unvarnished truth from sex workers and their clients.\n\n\n1)  Why People Sell Sex \nRupert explores the motivations of sex workers, from the Exeter housewife who claims she loves her work, to the Liverpool street-walker, and from the Mayfair escort who charges Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£700 an hour, to the young rent boy on the backstreets of Tel Aviv. Rupert offers a passionate defence of the dignity and rights of a group of people who he feels have been unjustly stigmatised for thousands of years. This is an unusually truthful and honest insight into the sex trade, and a funny and sometimes angry attack on the hypocrisy that surrounds the subject.\n\n2)  Why People Buy Sex \nTen percent of British men admit to having used a prostitute. What does that tell us about male desire? Rupert Everett explores the motivations of the men who use prostitutes, meeting self-confessed sex addicts, as well as a married man who enjoys sexual role-play with a dominatrix, and a divorced transgender father whose experiences with his 'straight' male clients cast a fascinating light on the sexuality of some British men. He also encounters a successful businessman who claims to have spent Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£150,000 on massage parlour prostitutes in two years, and a happily married man who says his prostitute use enhances rather than damages his marriage. Finally, he talks to comedian and actor Russell Brand, who talks frankly about his own experiences.\nThis is the conclusion to an unusually truthful and honest insight into the sex trade, and a funny and sometimes angry attack on the hypocrisy that surrounds the subject.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;94dcfdf3fcd4d8a0baa5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2969 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 2\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1,005 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.channel4.com/programmes/love-for-sale-with-rupert-everett\n\n2)  Related Documentaries \n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Call%20Girls%3A%20The%20Truth\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Prostitution%3A%20The%20Oldest%20Trade\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Sex%20Slaves\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:431416fe7abefca752e27913cd24798d5acdd89b","amp;dn":"Love.for.Sale.with.Rupert.Everett.1of2.Why.People.Sell.Sex.720p.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"431416fe7abefca752e27913cd24798d5acdd89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,20,22,254,122,190,252,167,82,226,121,19,205,36,121,141,90,205,216,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
