This collection contains all his big hits from the early part of his career.\nMany of the songs are upbeat, happy songs but I was drawn to his music originally by Here in the real world, a sad song that Alan delivers superbly, which was the title track of his debut album.\n\nThe album opens with Chattahoochie, a very upbeat song that should get those toes tapping. There are so many great songs here, including Gone country (an amusing song about failed pop and folk singers trying to sing country), Midnight in Montgomery (an ode to Hank Williams), I don't even know your name (which Alan wrote as a joke) and Someday (about always putting things off to be done some day).\n\nAlan writes or co-writes most of his own material, but has also demonstrated his brilliance with covers. On this collection, you will find covers of Tall tall trees (George Jones), Summertime blues (Eddie Cochran) and Mercury blues.\n\nThis collection covers the hits from the albums Here in the real world, Don't rock the jukebox, A lot about living and Who I am, together with two songs especially recorded for this collection - I'll try and the previously-mentioned Tall tall trees. As I write this, there is no volume two, but there is certainly enough material for such a volume. \n\nby ?????\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Chattahoochee (Extended Mix).wma                            \n02 - Gone Country.wma                                            \n03 - She's Got The Rhythm (And I Got The Blues).wma              \n04 - Midnight In Montgomery.wma                                  \n05 - Tall, Tall Trees.wma                                        \n06 - Chasin' That Neon Rainbow.wma                               \n07 - I'll Try.wma                                                \n08 - Don't Rock The Jukebox.wma                                  \n09 - Livin' On Love.wma                                          \n10 - Summertime Blues.wma                                        \n11 - Love's Got A Hold On You.wma                                \n12 - (Who Says) You Can't Have It All.wma                        \n13 - Home.wma                                                    \n14 - Wanted.wma                                                  \n15 - I Don't Even Know Your Name.wma                             \n16 - Dallas.wma                                                  \n17 - Here In The Real World.wma                                  \n18 - Someday.wma                                                 \n19 - Mercury Blues.wma                                           \n20 - I'd Love You All Over Again.wma  \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:108263ab519952824503cad5dc58c488d76ead4e","amp;dn":"Alan+Jackson+-+Greatest+Hits+Collection+%281995%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"108263ab519952824503cad5dc58c488d76ead4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,130,99,171,81,153,82,130,69,3,202,213,220,88,196,136,215,110,173,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
