The instrument contains 38 different core banks of hybrid scoring tools from hybrid rhythms to transforming metals, motion picture boom drones to sick, sick mega-horns, cinematic synths to impacts, phat downers to wild risers, crescendo and decrescendo FX, screaming distortions etc.\n\nThe library contains over 900 different musical sound designs in 38 core banks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ covering all the essential elements used in contemporary hybrid scoring. The library is using a highly advanced, yet ultra intuitive layout that essentially allows you to control most things from your keyboard. The bottom part of the keyboard controls the pitch of the sounds. The mid part of the keyboard controls the sounds themselves. The upper part of the keyboard gives you real-time control over all the effects, including distortion, phaser, flanger, lofi, convolution reverb, delay, lowpass, hipass and several other effects. In addition we also added a grain (bit-resolution) to the pitchbender and filter to the modwheel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ giving you an extreme amount of controls right at your finger tips.\n\nMeta-data is an integrated part of Hybrid Tools. The entire library comes in open 44.1/24 Bit Format and all meta-data comes ready-made for Soundminer etc.\n\n\n\nInstaLLation\n\n\nFull Retail version of Kontakt 4.2 or later required\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
