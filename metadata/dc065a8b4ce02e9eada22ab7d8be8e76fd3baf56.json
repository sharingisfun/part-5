Orphaned as a child and raised by a cold but regal aunt, Vivienne was taught to rely on her beauty and Texas tradition, and is expected to marry a wealthy and respectable man who will honor the Cally name. Friends with Houstonâ€™s most prominent families, sheâ€™s a beloved fixture at social events, and suffers no shortage of access to the cityâ€™s most eligible bachelors. Preston Duffin has known Vivienne and her set since childhood, though heâ€™s never shared their social aspirations or status. About to graduate from a prestigious architecture program, he is both fascinated and repelled by this group of friends he sits on the cusp of. Heâ€™s long admired Vivienneâ€™s beauty, but isnâ€™t sure he holds any place in so traditional a life. Intrigued by the extent to which Preston challenges the only way of life sheâ€™s ever known, Vivienne both courts his attention, and rebuffs his critiques of her antiquated values.\r\nInspired by Edith Whartonâ€™s The House of Mirth, A Wife of Noble Character shares the original novelâ€™s sharp social commentary at the same time that it illuminates the trappings and rewards of coming-of-age that are wholly unique to the twenty-first century. Part biting wit, part classic love story, it takes readers from Texas to Paris and Switzerland and back again, and will charm both fans of Wharton and anyone who has ever struggled to find their path in life.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc065a8b4ce02e9eada22ab7d8be8e76fd3baf56","amp;dn":"A+Wife+of+Noble+Character+-+Yvonne+Georgina+Puig+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc065a8b4ce02e9eada22ab7d8be8e76fd3baf56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,6,90,139,76,224,46,158,173,162,42,183,216,190,142,118,253,59,175,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
