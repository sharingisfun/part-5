CFD techniques are commonly used in the many areas of engineering where fluid behavior is an important factor. Traditional fields of application include aerospace and automotive design, and more recently, bioengineering and consumer and medical electronics. With Applied Computational Fluid Dynamics Techniques, 2nd edition, Rainald Lohner introduces the reader to the techniques required to achieve efficient CFD solvers, forming a bridge between basic theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the finite element method and its use in an industrial context where methods have to be both as simple but also as robust as possible.\nThis heavily revised second edition takes a practice-oriented approach with a strong emphasis on efficiency, and offers important new and updated material on;\nOverlapping and embedded grid methods\nTreatment of free surfaces\nGrid generation\nOptimal use of supercomputing hardware\nOptimal shape and process design\n\nApplied Computational Fluid Dynamics Techniques, 2nd edition is a vital resource for engineers, researchers and designers working on CFD, aero and hydrodynamics simulations and bioengineering. Its unique practical approach will also appeal to graduate students of fluid mechanics and aero and hydrodynamics as well as biofluidics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d3485cb5ea589057726a68bc43b57834770e09e","amp;dn":"Applied+Computational+Fluid+Dynamics+Techniques+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d3485cb5ea589057726a68bc43b57834770e09e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,52,133,203,94,165,137,5,119,38,166,139,196,59,87,131,71,112,224,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
