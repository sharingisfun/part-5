As the Immortal Ruler of the Nation, you'll take command of its heroes, forge marriages to strengthen your Bloodlines, and battle a mysterious enemy known as the Cadence in a war lasting hundreds of years.\n\nKey features:\n- Bloodline Genetics: Massive Chalice features an innovative Bloodline system that allows the player to marry heroes together to produce children. The Bloodline system uses a randomized genetic code for every hero. Their children can end up with the best (or worst!) gameplay-impacting traits of their parents.\n- Permadeath: The heroes in Massive Chalice age over the course of the timeline and eventually pass away. This forces the player to engage in the beauty of permadeath and always juggle an imperfect party of heroes with which to do battle!\n- Bloodline Relics: If a hero has fought valiantly enough when they inevitably pass away, their weapon has a chance to become a Bloodline Relic. This powerful Relic can be passed down to any character of the same house in order to carry on the legacy of the fallen hero!\n- Long View Strategy: Because the war lasts 300 years, players need to take a long view of their strategy. Decisions have to be made dozens of years in advance and long-term planning is incredibly important. That 3-year-old toddler is going to grow up to be your most reliable melee fighter sooner than you think!\n\nv0.86.1.1.755587 changelog:\nStrategic balance:\n- Hero Intuition - This value has been rebalanced from { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 } to { 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 }. This change brings Intuition numbers more in line with our other stats, allows Intuition to be buffed more reliably by percentage-based buffs, and makes it so that a level 10 Sagewright is only ~4x more productive than a level 1 Sagewright (instead of a 10x improvement)!\n- Intuition Research Time Reduction - Reduced the amount of research reduction from 0.05 per point to 0.01 per point. Nothing will feel different early on but higher level Sagewrights will not give the huge reductions that they were giving!\n- Building Time Multipliers - WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve changed many numbers for building out the map. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the breakdown!\n- Base Keep Building Time - Increased from 6 years to 8 years.\n- Keep Building Time Multipler - Increased from 1.4x per Keep to 1.6x per Keep.\n- Base SagewrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guild Time - Increased from 6 years to 12 years.\n- SagewrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guild Building Time Multipler - Increased from 1.75x per Guild to 2.25x per Guild.\n- Base Crucible Building Time - Increased from 6 years to 15 years.\n- Crucible Building Time Multipler - Increased from 1.75x per Crucible to 2.0x per Crucible.\n- Region Bonus: Building Time Reduction - Reduced from 100% build time reduction to 15% build time reduction. (this number was super broken!)\n- Region Bonus: SagewrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guild Intuition Buff - Reduced from 50% increase to 20% increase.\n- Cadence Attacks from years 250-300 are now ALWAYS triple attacks - This both removes some of the RNG feeling of the back half of the game and also makes the last 50 years of the game particularly brutal, potentially forcing you to lose some key structures and region bonuses!\nTactical balance:\n- Alchemist Skill Tree Rework!\n- Second Item Slot is now available at level 4.\n- Acid is now available at level 6.\n- Eagle Eye (now known as Spirit of the Dart Falcon) now increases the range and accuracy of thrown flasks by 2.\n- Alchemist: Relic Flasks - Flasks tossed by a Relic now get bonus damage that is in line with the relic damage bonus from other classes. This should keep your Alchemists doing competitive damage with the other classes into the late game!\n- Caberjack Skill Tree Rework!\n- Charge is now available at level 2!!!\n- Charge no longer applies a guaranteed stun but you can still stun an enemy if you knock them into something else!\n- Prime Target is now available at level 4. Prime Target is now targetless and taunts ALL enemies that the Caberjack has line-of-sight to.\n- Prime Target buffs the Armor and Resistance of the Caberjack by 4/4 for one turn.\n- Stun Slam (now known as Log Jam!) no longer stuns but deals damage to all enemies in an aoe around the Caberjack equal to 0.75x normal weapon damage.\n- Log Jam cooldown set to 4 turns.\n- Alchemist: Boom Slinger - Removed the additional flask toss range of this weapon. Rebalanced the accuracy graph to be more forgiving at close ranges but wilder at longer ranges. Also renamed this item to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boom SlingerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anarchy SlingerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in all instances.\n- Alchemist: Boom Slinger Damage - Adjusting the damage of Chaos Bombs from 10-10 to 5-25.\n- Alchemist: Pillar Pitcher Damage - Buffing the damage of Pillar Bombs from 3-5 up to 6-10.\n- Alchemist: Throw Items + Haste Hooch - The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Throw Haste HoochÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ skill now has 2 uses, up from 1, to match the standard number of Haste Hooches in your loadout.\n- Hunter: Shoot Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn Scoot - Removed the movement restriction on this skill. Previously it would restrict your movement to 3 tiles, now you get a free move equal to your normal movement range (usually 4, but could be more or less with buffs like Quick, Slow, or Haste Hooch!)\n- Random Events: Bloodthirsty trait - This buff now affects Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence.\nFeatures:\n- Relic Icon - Heroes in all views that have Relics now have an icon next to their banner to indicate this fact! This should make it easier to track your Relics!\n- END OF THE GAME Upcoming Event - At the beginning of the game a new event is added to the Upcoming Events area of the Strategic UI, letting you know how much longer you have to survive!\n- Pulsing Heart Icon for Marriages - In the Keep View, when a Partner has passed away and is missing, the Marry slot for the partner is now more clearly a button to be clicked and has a pulsing heart icon on it.\n- - Renamed Ã¢â‚¬Å“activeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tag to Ã¢â‚¬Å“vanguardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tag - Your deployable party is now referred to as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“vanguardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and your 5 current heroes are marked with this tag. This avoids confusion with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“activeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ category of your Hero Retinue in the Capital, which represents ALL heroes that are above age 15.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/246110/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/246110/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e1bf15bbcd036a686424631924311f14d31300c","amp;dn":"Massive+Chalice+v0.86.1.1.755587","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e1bf15bbcd036a686424631924311f14d31300c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,27,241,91,188,208,54,166,134,66,70,49,146,67,17,241,77,49,48,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
