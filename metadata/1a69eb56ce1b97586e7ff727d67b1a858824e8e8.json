We open with the Creation of the World and arrive at the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve (Michael Parks and Ulla Bergryd) and continue on to Cain (Richard Harris) and the murder of Abel (Franco Nero). Next, we visit Noah (John Huston) and his ark with its spectacular flood sequence. Then we come to the story of Nimrod, King of Babel (Stephen Boyd), the emergence of man's vanity and the heights to which it could aspire if unchecked. Finally we cover Abraham (George C. Scott), a mystic who spoke personally with God, a leader of men, a builder of nations, a pioneer and a warrior and Sarah (Ava Gardner). At the time she conceived her first child, the event being forecast by an Angel of the Lord. Three such Heavenly Messengers (all portrayed by Peter O'Toole) appeared in the course of events which befell Abraham and Sarah.\n\n\n\n--- File Information ---\n\nFile Name............
