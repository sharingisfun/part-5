His likeness appears in frescoes on the walls of catacombs that date from Roman times; he is featured in the stained glass windows of Gothic churches; and he can be found in various forms in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pop culture.The Biblical Saviour is not a static, immaterial deity: ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mortal birth, unusual life and dramatic death make him an accessible subject for religious and secular artists alike. Whether they show the spirituality of God Incarnate or the earthly characteristics of a flesh-and-blood man, artistic depictions of Christ are the most controversial, moving or inspirational examples of religious art.\n\nThis richly illustrated book explores the various ways that Christ is rendered in art, from CimabueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nativity scenes and Fra AngelicoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paintings of the Crucifixion to the provocative portraits of Salvador DalÃƒÂ­ and Andres Serrano. Author Joseph Lewis French guides the reader through the most iconic representations of Christ in art Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tender or graphic, classical or bizarre, these images of the Messiah reveal the diverse roles of the Son of God in the social milieus and personal lives of the artists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14974150a95c81decb0db14450d8ce7c39f8476b","amp;dn":"Christ+in+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14974150a95c81decb0db14450d8ce7c39f8476b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,151,65,80,169,92,129,222,203,13,177,68,80,216,206,124,57,248,71,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
