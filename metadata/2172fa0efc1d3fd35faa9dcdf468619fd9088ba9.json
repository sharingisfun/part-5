The band's line-up consists of vocalist Sonny Sandoval, drummer Wuv Bernardo, guitarist Marcos Curiel, and bassist Traa Daniels. They have released six major label studio albums along with two independent albums and have sold over 12 million records worldwide. Over the course of their career, the band has received three Grammy Award nominations, contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks and toured internationally. With their third studio album, The Fundamental Elements of Southtown, they achieved their initial mainstream success; the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA in 2000.Their following studio album, Satellite, continued the band's success with the singles, &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot;, pushing it to go triple platinum.\n\n\n\n\nStyle and influences\n\nThe band's name, Payable on Death (P.O.D.), derives itself from the banking term &quot;Payable on Death&quot;. The band chose this name to be a direct tie in with the Christian theology that explains that since Jesus died on the Cross, Christians' debts to God have been paid for; in other words all believers, in their acceptance that Jesus was sacrificed for them on God's behalf, have inherited eternal life with no strings attached. P.O.D.'s style has evolved over the years, from the rap metal sound on their early albums to the nu metal and reggae-infused alternative metal styles for which they're most well known.[citation needed] The band's seventh album, When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance, is a combination of alternative rock, reggae rock and Latin-influenced metal with almost none of the rap metal or nu metal sound of their older releases. P.O.D.'s influences include Santana, Bad Brains, Bob Marley, Metallica, U2, Pantera, Rage Against the Machine, Beastie Boys, Black Flag, Faith No More, The Police, Jane's Addiction, Living Colour, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sepultura and Suicidal Tendencies\n\n\n\n\nTrackList\n\n01.
