And, most of those little things add up to the fact that they think you are perfect, no matter how you perceive yourself.\n\nThe black-and-white video's concept is pretty simple Ã¢â‚¬â€ a 1D recording session. Each of the guys sits in the booth, laying down vocals for their part of the song. In between solo shots of the heartthrobs, the fivesome is also seen goofing off from time to time together and sitting around, playing the guitar, while they reminisce about their perfectly imperfect girlfriends. The quiet tone of the clip complements the ballad's sentimental lyrics.\n\nGenre : Pop\n\nVideo \nFormat : mp4 \nFrame size : 1920 x 1080\nBit rate : 3,404 kbps\nFrame rate : 25 frames/second\n\nAudio\nFormat : mp3\nBit rate : 230 kbps\nSample rate : 44.1 KHz\nTracks : 1\n\nTime : 3:37","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f439a6233f6d83ce25d1daecf7863d9861665c","amp;dn":"One+Direction+-+Little+Things+2012+Single+%28Video+mp4+-+Audio+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f439a6233f6d83ce25d1daecf7863d9861665c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,244,57,166,35,63,109,131,206,37,209,218,236,247,134,61,152,97,102,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
