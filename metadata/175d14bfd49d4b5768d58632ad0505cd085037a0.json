With the best of intentions, Emma plays matchmaker for her friends, most notably her friend Harriet (Toni Collette), who Emma links up with the Reverend Elton (Alan Cumming), and her governess, (Greta Scacchi), who she introduces to her future husband, Mr. Weston (James Cosmo). However, Emma is not nearly as good at playing Cupid as she likes to imagine, and she spends so much time trying to solve everyone else's romantic problems that it takes her quite some time to realize that she's fallen in love with Mr. Knightly (Jeremy Northam). \n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Emma.1996.480p.bluray.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 175 Kbps\nLength            : 1.83 GiB for 2h 0mn 43s 195ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 856 x 480 (1.783) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 320 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116191&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116191&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:175d14bfd49d4b5768d58632ad0505cd085037a0","amp;dn":"Emma.1996.480p.bluray.x264.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"175d14bfd49d4b5768d58632ad0505cd085037a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,93,20,191,212,157,75,87,104,213,134,50,173,5,5,205,8,80,55,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
