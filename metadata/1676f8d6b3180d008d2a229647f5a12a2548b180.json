When Moemi asks who Youta likes as a girlfriend, and then tells him she likes Takashi, Youta is crushed. He goes to a strange video rental store and rents &quot;Video Girl Ai&quot;.

But since the VCR was broken, Ai changes from the &quot;comforter&quot; she was designed to be into a tomboy. Her job is to get Youta and Moemi back together, and to help his confidence. But Ai falls in love with Youta&amp;#039;s bumbling ways. Moemi starts to date Takashi, but he thinks he&amp;#039;s second choice to Youta. And, since Ai isn&amp;#039;t doing her job with Youta and Moemi, Ai creator decides to &quot;recall&quot; her. Who will Youta choose, the &quot;real&quot; Moemi, or this strange girl?
