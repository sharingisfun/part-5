Since there are many faces to violence, the upload concentrates on the following issues: hegemony, culture of war, racism, and hate crimes.\n\nIt should be noted that since Christianity lies at the roots of the moral system of the West, all previous uploads that discuss violence in Christianity are relevant to our subject here. [see for example the uploads about: Christianity and Religious Persecution; History of the Inquisition; Christianity and Ethics of War;  History and Tales of the Crusades; Racism, Slavery and the Bible;.. etc.]\n\nThere are 48 titles in this UL distributed over the main directory and 2 subdirectories.
