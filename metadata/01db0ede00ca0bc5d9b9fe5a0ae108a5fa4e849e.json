Although FLAC is Lossless in some cases it compresses the db stream to save space! DB is volume! So make sure you normalize all your FLAC to -1db!  I recommend adobe audition....\n\nWhat is normalization?\n\nThe Normalize effect amplifies the entire file or selection equally. For example, if the original audio reaches a loud peak of 80% and a quiet low of 20%, normalizing to 100% amplifies the loud peak to 100% and the quiet low to 40%.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01db0ede00ca0bc5d9b9fe5a0ae108a5fa4e849e","amp;dn":"Smashing+Pumpkins+Mellon+Collie+And+The+Infinite+Sadness+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01db0ede00ca0bc5d9b9fe5a0ae108a5fa4e849e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,219,14,222,0,202,11,197,217,185,254,90,10,225,8,165,250,78,132,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
