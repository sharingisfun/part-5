MDT: Preventive Maintenance and Inspection provides the knowledge needed to identify potential problems during regular service, before they turn into major repair issues or a roadside breakdown. The book breaks down need-to-know content areas into chapters that make sense: from general shop safety and hand tools to truck/trailer reefer service and coupling systems and everything in between. Each chapter includes procedures for inspecting and maintaining that specific area. Using a generic preventive maintenance checklist as a guideline throughout, this go-to guide has everything the beginning technician needs to perform effective servicing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0512a043ccaadcff4b19ea916cf90feeeb06b8f","amp;dn":"Modern+Diesel+Technology%3A+Preventive+Maintenance+and+Inspection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0512a043ccaadcff4b19ea916cf90feeeb06b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,81,42,4,60,202,173,207,244,177,158,169,22,207,144,254,238,176,107,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
