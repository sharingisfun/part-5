When people arrive at the Element, they feel most themselves and most inspired and achieve at their highest levels. With a wry sense of humor, Ken Robinson looks at the conditions that enable us to find ourselves in the Element and those that stifle that possibility. Drawing on the stories of a wide range of people, including Paul McCartney, Matt Groening, Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington, and Bart Conner, he shows that age and occupation are no barrier and that this is the essential strategy for transforming education, business, and communities in the twenty-first century.\n\nA breakthrough book about talent, passion, and achievement from one of the world's leading thinkers on creativity and self-fulfillment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762e7f8130d13c1b65e58afb59663c5d15e8196d","amp;dn":"The+Element%3A+How+Finding+Your+Passion+Changes+Everything","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762e7f8130d13c1b65e58afb59663c5d15e8196d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,46,127,129,48,209,60,27,101,229,138,251,89,102,60,93,21,232,25,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
