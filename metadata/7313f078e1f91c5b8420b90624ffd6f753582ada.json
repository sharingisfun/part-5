Isbell had already displayed his songwriting prowess during his tenure with the Truckers, and he funneled those talents into Sirens of the Ditch, a bluesy, punk-infused lesson in guitar tones and Southern swagger that marked his solo debut in summer 2007. Backed by a band dubbed the 400 Unit, Isbell took his songs on the road and soon began penning another album, which he recorded with the 400 Unit in 2008. Released the following year, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit found the songwriter ruminating on issues of love, youth, and war. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tLightning Rod Records\t\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Alabama Pines\n02.Go It Alone\n03.We've Met\n04.Codeine\n05.Stopping By\n06.Daisy Mae\n07.The Ballad Of Nobeard\n08.Never Could Believe\n09.Heart On A String\n10.Save It For Sunday\n11.Tour Of Duty\n\n\n\n\n\n             ***Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7313f078e1f91c5b8420b90624ffd6f753582ada","amp;dn":"Jason+Isbell+And+The+400+Unit+-+Here+We+Rest+%282011%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7313f078e1f91c5b8420b90624ffd6f753582ada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,19,240,120,225,249,28,91,132,32,185,6,36,255,214,247,83,88,42,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
