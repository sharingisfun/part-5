He is considered one of the greatest singers in popular music and a major artist in soul and rhythm and blues.\n His singing style was powerfully influential among soul artists of 1960s and helped exemplify the Stax Sound.\nAfter appearing at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival Redding wrote and recorded the iconic &quot;(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; with \nSteve Cropper. The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts after his death\n in a plane crash. The Dock of the Bay became the first posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart.\nRedding received many posthumous accolades, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll\n Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He received the honorific &quot;King of Soul&quot;. In addition to &quot;(Sittin' On) \nThe Dock of the Bay,&quot; &quot;Respect&quot; and &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; are among his best known songs.\n\n==============================================\n\nTracklist\n\nDock Of The Bay \t2:43 \t\nThe Happy Song \t2:40 \t\nAmen \t3:20 \t\nI've Got Dream To Remember \t3:10 \t\nFa - Fa - Fa - Fa \t3:39 \t\nMy Girl \t2:54 \t\nTramp \t3:01 \t\nMr. Pittyful \t2:26 \t\nHard To Handle \t2:18 \t\nI Can't Turn You Loose \t2:36 \t\nTry A Little Tenderness \t3:41 \t\nDaytripper \t2:54 \n\n=============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 5697 MB\nAlbum                                    : The Best of Otis Redding\nTrack name/Total                         : 12\nPerformer                                : Otis Redding\nGenre                                    : Soul, pop\nRecorded date                            : 1980\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 725 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37294a8fcc8f1fcf3aac4cf5df867d2263cf32a6","amp;dn":"Otis+Redding+-+The+Best+Of+%281980%29+Flac%5B24+Bit+96KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37294a8fcc8f1fcf3aac4cf5df867d2263cf32a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,41,74,143,204,143,31,207,58,172,76,245,223,134,125,34,99,207,50,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
