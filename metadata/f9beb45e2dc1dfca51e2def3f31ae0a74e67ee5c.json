The author was born and raised into a Methodist family. Late in her life she was hit with cancer. \nWhile recuperating from her illness, she started reading the Bible seriously.\nTwo years later, she wrote this book, and announced here conversion to atheism. The book contains several Chapters that discuss ethics and morality of the Bible and of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nOne tidbit about Mrs. Green: she used to believe that the great majority of the Christian community were Bible illiterates, and the best way to spread atheism was to make more people read the Bible!\n\n\nWe have 27 titles here:\n\n-  Benedix - Subverting Scriptures; Critical Reflections on the Use of the Bible (2009)\n\n-  Besant - Freethinkers Textbook, Part II; Christianity, Its Evidence, Origin, Morality &amp; History (1889)\n\n-  Bonner - Christianity and Conduct (1919)\n\n-  Daly - When Slavery was Called Freedom; Evangelicalism, Proslavery, and the Causes of the Civil War (2002)\n\n-  Daschke &amp; Kille (eds.) - A Cry Instead of Justice; The Bible and Cultures of Violence in Psychological Perspective (2010)\n\n-  Dell - Ethical and Unethical in the Old Testament; God and Humans in Dialogue (2010)\n\n-  Engelke - A Problem of Presence; Beyond Scripture in an African Church (2007)\n\n-  Fiala - What would Jesus Really Do; The Power and Limits of Jesus' Moral Teachings (2007)\n\n-  Fox - The Ethics and Theology of the Old Testament (1918)\n\n-  Gill (ed.) - The Cambridge Companion to Christian Ethics (2001)\n\n-  Graham - The Contrast; The Bible and Abolitionism (1844)\n\n-  Green - The Born Again Skeptic's Guide to the Bible (1979)\n\n-  Hoose (ed.) - Christian Ethics; An Introduction (1998)\n\n-  Ingersoll - Some Mistakes of Moses, 10th ed.
