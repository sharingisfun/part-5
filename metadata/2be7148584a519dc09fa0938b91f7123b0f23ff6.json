You'll then learn about variables, functions, and how to perform basic calculations. \n\nNext, Jason will guide you in learning how to do Algebra, Trigonometry, and Calculus computations both numerically and symbolically.  The course wraps up with basic plotting in Matlab. Take the mystery out of Matlab and improve your productivity with the software immediately!\n\n\n\nDetailed Lesson Index:\n\n1.
