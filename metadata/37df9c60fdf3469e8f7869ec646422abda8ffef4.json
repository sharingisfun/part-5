The Muppets made Jim Henson a household name, but they were just part of his remarkable story.\n\nThis extraordinary biographyÃ¢â‚¬â€written with the generous cooperation of the Henson familyÃ¢â‚¬â€covers the full arc of HensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all-too-brief life: from his childhood in Leland, Mississippi, through the years of burgeoning fame in America, to the decade of international celebrity that preceded his untimely death at age fifty-three. Drawing on hundreds of hours of new interviews with Henson's family, friends, and closest collaborators, as well as unprecedented access to private family and company archives, Brian Jay Jones explores the creation of the Muppets, HensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contributions to Sesame Street and Saturday Night Live, and his nearly ten-year campaign to bring The Muppet Show to television. Jones provides the imaginative context for HensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s non-Muppet projects, including the richly imagined worlds of The Dark Crystal and LabyrinthÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as fascinating misfires like HensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream of opening an inflatable psychedelic nightclub.\n\nAn uncommonly intimate portrait, Jim Henson captures all the facets of this American original: the master craftsman who revolutionized the presentation of puppets on television, the savvy businessman whose dealmaking prowess won him a reputation as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the new Walt Disney,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the creative team leader whose collaborative ethos earned him the undying loyalty of everyone who worked for him. Here also is insight into HensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intensely private personal life: his Christian Science upbringing, his love of fast cars and expensive art, and his weakness for women. Though an optimist by nature, Henson was haunted by the notion that he would not have time to do all the things he wanted to do in lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€a fear that his heartbreaking final hours would prove all too well founded.\n\nAn up-close look at the charmed life of a legend, Jim Henson gives the full measure to a man whose joyful genius transcended age, language, geography, and cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€and continues to beguile audiences worldwide.
