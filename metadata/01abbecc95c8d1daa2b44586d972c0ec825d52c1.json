Born on April 4, 1952, in Belfast, Ireland, Moore became interested in guitar during the '60s, upon discovering such blues-rock masters as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and perhaps his biggest influence of all, Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green. After relocating to Dublin later in the decade, Moore joined a local rock group called Skid Row, which featured a young singer by the name of Phil Lynott, who would soon after leave the group to double up on bass and form Thin Lizzy. Skid Row persevered, however, eventually opening a show for Moore's heroes, Peter Green and Fleetwood Mac, and making such an impression on the veteran group that Green personally requested their manager help secure Skid Row a recording contract with CBS (in addition, Green sold Moore one of his most-used guitars, a maple 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard, which would become Moore's primary instrument).\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Walking By Myself\n02.Cold Day In Hell\n03.Still Got The Blues\n04.Parisienne Walkways (Live)\n05.Oh Pretty Woman\n06.If You Be My Baby\n07.Stormy Monday\n08.King Of The Blues\n09.Story Of The Blues\n10.You Upset Me Baby\n11.Walkin' Thru The Park\n12.Need Your Love So Bad\n13.Too Tired\n14.Enough Of The Blues\n15.Bad For You Baby\n16.That's Why I Play The Blues\n17.As The Years Go Passing By\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Texas Strut\n02.Since I Met You Baby (With B.B.
