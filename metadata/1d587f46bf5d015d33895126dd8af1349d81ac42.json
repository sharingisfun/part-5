I will only point out some of the new functionality that were not present in the last version of AutoRoute 2007.\n\nWhat's new in AutoRoute 2010\n\nImproved map coverage\n\n\n\nThe new Microsoft AutoRoute 2010 comes with street-level map data of 43 European countries versus the previous version of AutoRoute 2007 which contained detailed map coverage of only 36 countries.\n\nDetail road map data is included for the following European countries: Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Gibraltar, Germany, Greece, Guernsey, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Jersey, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Isle of Man, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Vatican City.\n\nHowever, I only see the following countries listed on the drop down menu of the find dialog box: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guernsey, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. So despite the fact that many more countries do have excellent street-level maps, still only the above 17 listed countries have the address find feature implemented.\n\nThe limitation of the address find feature would not prevent me from using Microsoft AutoRoute while vacation in any of the other countries. Users can set destination by searching POIs (points of interest), or simply by selecting the destination(s) by clicking on the particular spot(s) on the map.\n\nIn total, the new 2010 version contains 8.3 million kilometers or 5.1 million miles of routable roads. Version 2007 had 6.3 million km / 3.9 million miles.\n\nMicrosoft AutoRoute 2010 is for Europe.System Requiem:\n Microsoft Windows XP, Vista or 7\n Intel Pentium processor or compatible\n 512 MB RAM\n 2 GB free hard disk space\n\nInstall Note:\n Burn or mount the Image with your favorite Tool\n Start Setup and install\n Done","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d587f46bf5d015d33895126dd8af1349d81ac42","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Autoroute+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d587f46bf5d015d33895126dd8af1349d81ac42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,88,127,70,191,93,1,93,51,137,81,38,221,138,241,52,157,129,172,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
