With lives and millions of dollars at stake, the fixer plays a deadly cat-and-mouse game with a jury member (John Cusack) and a mysterious woman (Rachel Weisz) who offer to deliver the verdict to the highest bidder. Packed with danger, intrigue and pulse-pounding twists and turns, Runaway Jury is a hit!\n\n&quot;The plot to sell the jury to the highest-bidding party was the most ingenious device in the story because it avoided pitting the &quot;evil&quot; and the &quot;good&quot; protagonists directly against each other in a stereotypical manner while still plunging both of them into a moral abyss.&quot; - Roger Ebert\n\n&quot;From master storyteller John Grisham and the director of &quot;Don't Say A Word&quot; comes a taut suspense-thriller that grabs hold of you and never lets go.&quot; - Philadelphia Metro. \n\nThis movie ripped very very well to 700 mb and is burn tested!
