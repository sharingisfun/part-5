Five Children and It\r\nEdith Nesbit is probably best known these days for The Railway Children, but her earlier book Five Children and It was even more influential, its blend of magic and the everyday paving the way for the Narnia stories and Harry Potter. A classic fantasy story about a group of siblings who discover a creature that can grant wishes, Nesbit's warm, witty children's fable was shaped by her own troubled family life.\r\n\r\nIn this film, actress and Nesbit fan Samantha Bond discovers how a rootless childhood and terrible personal tragedy influenced Five Children and It, delving into the origins and legacy of a book that can be arguably said to have kick-started modern children's fiction.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 21 (~3247Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.47 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 29 min\r\nNumber Of Parts: 2\r\nTotal Size: 701 MB (average)\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed0095b6675a7c886a55eaadcdf88dc2e15b7301","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Life+of+Childrens+Books+1of2+1080p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed0095b6675a7c886a55eaadcdf88dc2e15b7301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,0,149,182,103,90,124,136,106,85,234,173,205,248,141,194,225,91,115,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
