Each of the four Vedas consists of the metrical Mantra or Samhita' part and the prose 'Brahmana' part giving discussions and directions for the detail of the ceremonies at which the Mantras were to be used and explanations of the legends connected with the Mantras and rituals. Both these portions are termed shruti (which tradition says to have been heard but not composed or written down by men).\n\nThe Rig Veda commentary by Jaydev Sharma was first published in 1930 in 7 volumes along with 2 volumes of Yajur Veda, one volume of Sama Veda &amp; 2 volumes of Atharva Veda. The author has taken care to make his commentary lucid and profound. His commentary is based on the commentaries of ancient sages like Sayana, Skandaswami, Venkatamadhava and also on the modern day sages like Swami Dayanand.\n\nFour Vedas - Sanskrit text with Hindi Commentary \nby Pandit Jaydev Sharma in 12 volumes\n\nHymns of the Atharva-Veda 1 + 2 \n\nRiGVED DARSHAN\n\nSamved Darshan\n\nYajurved Darshan\n\nAudio:\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nOverall bit rate mode : Constant\nOverall bit rate : 320 Kbps\nTrack name/Position : -1\nEncoded by : sum1_here\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nWriting library : LAMELAME_MAJOR_VERSI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb21aee368ecc118ddd8bd598ec3de02350425e3","amp;dn":"Four+Vedas+Hindi+PDF+%2B+Audio+Complete+Collection+-+sum1_here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb21aee368ecc118ddd8bd598ec3de02350425e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,33,174,227,104,236,193,24,221,216,189,89,142,195,222,2,53,4,37,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
