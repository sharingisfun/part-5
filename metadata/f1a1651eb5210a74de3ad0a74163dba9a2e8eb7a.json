And although there are plenty of large tomes that cover all the nooks and crannies of Eclipse, what you really need is a quick, handy guide to the features that are used over and over again in Java programming. You need answers to basic questions such as: Where was that menu? What does that command do again? And how can I set my classpath on a per-project basis?\n\nThis practical pocket guide gets you up to speed quickly with Eclipse. It covers basic concepts, including Views and editors, as well as features that are not commonly understood, such as Perspectives and Launch Configurations. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to write and debug your Java codeÃ¢â‚¬â€œand how to integrate that code with tools such as Ant and JUnit. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also get a toolbox full of tips and tricks to handle commonÃ¢â‚¬â€œand sometimes unexpectedÃ¢â‚¬â€œtasks that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll run across in your Java development cycle.\n\nAdditionally, the Eclipse IDE Pocket Guide has a thorough appendix detailing all of EclipseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important views, menus, and commands.\n\nThe Eclipse IDE Pocket Guide is just the resource you need for using Eclipse, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Put it in your back pocket, or just throw it in your backpack. With this guide in hand, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready to tackle the Eclipse programming environment.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
