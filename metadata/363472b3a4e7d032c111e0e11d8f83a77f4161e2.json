It opens in 1972, as the three are members of an East L.A. gang known as the &quot;Vatos Locos&quot;, and the story focuses on how a violent crime and the influence of narcotics alter their lives.  Miklo is incarcerated and sent to San Quentin, where he makes a &quot;home&quot; for himself.  Cruz becomes an exceptional artist, but a heroin addiction overcomes him with tragic results.  Paco becomes a cop and an enemy to his &quot;carnal&quot;, Miklo.\n\nIf you've never seen this film, you're missing out.  There aren't really all that many great films about gang life, and when you limit these kinds of films to those about Latino gang life, the number is less than a handful.  This film is one of those.  Great acting, great writing, and it's based on the true life experiences of Jimmy Santiago Baca.\n\nScreen Shots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/bbh5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Additional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
