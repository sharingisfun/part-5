This is duly noted in their name choice, a    \n section of lyrics from the Counting CrowsÃƒÂ¢?? song ÃƒÂ¢??Ghost Train,ÃƒÂ¢??    \n which proceeds as follows: ÃƒÂ¢??Took the cannonball down to the ocean,\n Across the desert from the sea to shining sea, I rode a ladder    \n that climbed across the nation, Fifty million feet of earth       \n between the buried and me.ÃƒÂ¢??                                       \n                                                                   \n The band was founded in early 2000 by vocalist Tommy Giles Rogers,\n Jr. and guitarist Paul Waggoner: whose prior project was a        \n metalcore/straight edge band Prayer for Cleansing. Since that     \n time, the band has undergone many lineup changes. Currently, the  \n band contains two members from fellow North Carolina band Glass   \n Casket, Dustie Waring on guitar and Blake Richardson on drums.    \n This has caused some question as to the future of Glass Casket,   \n although both deny claims that Glass Casket will break up anytime \n soon, as the bandÃƒÂ¢??s other members are currently busy with college \n and jobs.                                                         \n===================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1c3f705dd02d40dd09644be5d53c6355c12a4e7","amp;dn":"Between+the+Buried+and+Me+-+Alaska+%282005%29+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1c3f705dd02d40dd09644be5d53c6355c12a4e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,195,247,5,221,2,212,13,208,150,68,190,93,83,198,53,92,18,164,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
