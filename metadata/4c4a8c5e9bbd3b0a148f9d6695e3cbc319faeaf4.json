The HM Learning and Study Skills Program is geared for specific grade levels, allowing you to encourage the middle and junior high student's growing capacity for abstraction. At the same time, the activity-oriented structure keeps their attention. Students will learn to harness their particular &quot;learning style&quot; in a way that best suits their needs.\n\nEach student workbook teaches and reinforces the essential skills students need to be successful: skills for perceiving, organizing, making sense of, and using ideas and data. The workbook functions as a text for learning study skills and as a reference resource throughout the year. \n\nRemember, learning and study skills are not substitutes for hard work. But, by following the suggestions within this workbook, students should be able to use their time and energy more efficiently","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c4a8c5e9bbd3b0a148f9d6695e3cbc319faeaf4","amp;dn":"The+hm+Learning+and+Study+Skills+Program%2C+4E-+Student+%5BPDF%5D+%5BSto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c4a8c5e9bbd3b0a148f9d6695e3cbc319faeaf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,74,140,94,155,189,59,10,20,143,157,102,149,227,203,195,25,250,234,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
