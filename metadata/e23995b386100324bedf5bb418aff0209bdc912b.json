A cover of that bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tiger Mountain Peasant Song even helped launch the then-teenagers to YouTube fame back in 2008. But in 2014, styles have changed and so have the SÃƒÂ¶derbergs: First Aid KitÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs major-label debut, Stay Gold, moves well beyond the portentous prettiness of the pairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2012 breakthrough, The LionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Roar.\nThe music is lighter on its feet and less haunting, but the lyrics have picked up some additional heft along the way: Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather be broken than empty / IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather be shattered than hollow,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the SÃƒÂ¶derbergs sing in a particularly barren moment from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shattered &amp; Hollow.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Their vocals still ring out sweetly,Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nbut thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a welcome edge to their delivery throughout the record that digs deep. Even when a song like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The BellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ never accelerates beyond a lightly lilting amble, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potency to it.\n\nFirst Aid Kit could have easily gotten stuck in a sullen rut, opting for stately beauty over the versatility showcased here. But Stay Gold is a statement of staying power; a collection of bright, smart, substantial songs that stick around. By the time the SÃƒÂ¶derbergs rustle up a bit of countrified rowdiness in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Heaven KnowsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ a sure set-closer at the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerts for years to come Ã¢â‚¬â€ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve fully reset expectations. First Aid KitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music has always been charming, but the duo has found the capacity to thrill, too.\nFantastic Band...
