The authors focus on building students' intuition to help them understand why the techniques presented work in general, and why, in some situations, they fail. With a wealth of examples and exercises, the text demonstrates the relevance of numerical analysis to a variety of disciplines and provides ample practice for students. The applications chosen demonstrate concisely how numerical methods can be, and often must be, applied in real-life situations. In this edition, the presentation has been fine-tuned to make the book even more useful to the instructor and more interesting to the reader. Overall, students gain a theoretical understanding of, and a firm basis for future study of, numerical analysis and scientific computing. A more applied text with a different menu of topics is the authors' highly regarded NUMERICAL METHODS, Third Edition.\n\nAbout the Author\nRichard L. Burden is a Professor of Mathematics at Youngstown State University. His research interests include numerical linear algebra and numerical solution of partial differential equations.\n\nJ. Douglas Faires is a Professor of Mathematics at Youngstown State University. His research interests include analysis, numerical analysis, and mathematics history. Dr. Faires has won many awards, including Outstanding College-University Teacher of Mathematics, Ohio Section of MAA (1996) and Youngstown State University, Distinguished Professor for Teaching (1995-1996).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f361ef5e5e432b03975967cc437d837671c9b23","amp;dn":"Numerical+Analysis+7th+Edition+%287e%29+-+Burden+and+Faires","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f361ef5e5e432b03975967cc437d837671c9b23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,54,30,245,229,228,50,176,57,117,150,124,196,55,216,55,103,28,155,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
