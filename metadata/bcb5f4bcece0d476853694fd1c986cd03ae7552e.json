With an interstellar treaty signed by nearly every colony and enforced through a solid alliance between them, it seemed as if mankind has finally conquered war. This is what Sergeant R. Wilson Rogers experienced for ten years before he left the Meridan Patrol Fleet to become a smuggler.\r\n\r\nBut when a deal goes south, things quickly turn sour. Rogers is forced back into military service as an ensign and discovers a coup forming within the fleet. His backdoor and criminal experience is the best thing to stop this coup, and somehow, he finds himself working to do just that. \r\n\r\nRead by Joe Zieja\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: Variable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb5f4bcece0d476853694fd1c986cd03ae7552e","amp;dn":"Joe+Zieja+-+Mechanical+Failure+%28Epic+Failure+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb5f4bcece0d476853694fd1c986cd03ae7552e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,181,244,188,236,224,212,118,133,54,148,253,28,152,108,208,58,231,85,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
