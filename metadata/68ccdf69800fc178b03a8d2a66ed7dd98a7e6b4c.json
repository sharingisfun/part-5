He wants more from life than the glib, superficial truths and material things that are on offer to him. He reaches out to his family and friends and psychiatrist to provide him with the great answers in life. But his spiritual deliverance remains beyond his grasp until he reaches a bizarre arrangement with a fellow hippie.\n\nRobert Bresson is one of France's most distinguished and influential film makers. His works include 'Lancelot Du Lac' and 'L'Argent' and he has won major prizes and unrestrained critical acclaim. Many distinguished critics regard THE DEVIL PROBABLY as a masterpiece, and one of Bresson's greatest films.  Artificial Eye\n\nRegarded by many as a masterpiece, Bresson's film tells the story of a young man living in Paris who desires more from life than the glib, superficial truths and material things  that are on offer to him. He reaches out to his friends and psychiatrist to provide him with the great answers in life. But his spiritual deliverance remains beyond his grasp until he reaches a bizarre arrangement with a fellow drifter. Shot in his signature spare style, Bresson's penultimate work is as visionary, hyptonic and enduring as any of the  films in his truly remarkable career.
