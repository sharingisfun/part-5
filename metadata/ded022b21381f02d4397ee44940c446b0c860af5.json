They have, before the show, named an amount of money that they wish to get, and the rules stipulate that if they do not raise at least this amount from the dragons, they get nothing.\n\nThe dragons then probe the idea further, often revealing an embarrassing lack of preparation on the part of the contestants or uncovering troubling facts, and consequently rejecting the investment. It is common in a show to see five or six ideas and only one that attracts the dragons' money. In return, the contestant give the dragons a percentage of the company's stock, which is the chief point of negotiation.\n\n\nGood video/audio quality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ded022b21381f02d4397ee44940c446b0c860af5","amp;dn":"Dragons+Den+%28UK%29+Complete+Season+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ded022b21381f02d4397ee44940c446b0c860af5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,208,34,178,19,129,240,45,67,151,238,68,148,12,68,107,12,134,10,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
