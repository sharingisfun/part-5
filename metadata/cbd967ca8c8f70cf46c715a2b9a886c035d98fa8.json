The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.\n\n\nSupported operating systems:\n\n   Windows 7 Ultimate\n   Windows 7 Ultimate E\n   Windows 7 Professional\n   Windows 7 Professional E\n   Windows 7 Home Premium\n   Windows 7 Home Premium E\n   Windows 7 Home Basic\n   Windows 7 Starter\n   Windows 7 Starter E\n   Windows Vista Ultimate\n   Windows Vista Business\n   Windows Vista Business N\n   Windows Vista Home Premium\n   Windows Vista Home Basic\n   Windows Vista Home Basic N\n   Windows Vista Starter\n   Windows Server 2008 Enterprise\n   Windows Server 2008 Enterprise (Without Hyper-V)\n   Windows Server 2008 Foundation\n   Windows Server 2008 Standard\n   Windows Small Business Server 2008\n   Windows Storage Server 2008 Standard\n   Windows Storage Server 2008 R2 Essentials\n   Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise\n   Windows Server 2008 R2 Foundation\n   Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard\n   Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter\n   Windows Small Business Server 2011 Standard\n   Windows Small Business Server 2011 Essentials\n   Windows Home Server 2011\n   Windows Server 2012 Standard\n   Windows Server 2012 Essentials\n   Windows Server 2012 Foundation\n   Windows Server 2012 Datacenter\n   Windows Storage Server 2012 Standard\n   Windows Storage Server 2012 Workgroup\n   Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 Standard\n   Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 Premium\n\n\n\nNote: You must be running build 7600 or greater for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\nNote: I don't recommend using any of the Windows 7 E editions.\nNote: Windows 7 N editions will only be supported when OEM SLP serials leak.\n\n\nApplication integrity checking?\n\nHover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.\n\nNote: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\n\nVirus scanner results\n\nAll virus scanner detection's are a false-positive as long as the MD5 matches. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd967ca8c8f70cf46c715a2b9a886c035d98fa8","amp;dn":"Windows+Loader+v2+1+8+%5BDaz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd967ca8c8f70cf46c715a2b9a886c035d98fa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,217,103,202,140,143,112,207,70,199,21,162,185,168,134,192,53,217,143,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
