The quintet actually released only this record, recorded at a series of performances in 1973, but the sound caught on with Grateful Dead fans and the record actually built up the group&amp;#039;s legacy long after they disbanded. \n\nThe songs themselves, mostly penned by guitarist Peter Rowan and Grisman as well as a handful of traditional numbers and even a revamped version of the Rolling Stones&amp;#039; classic &quot;Wild Horses,&quot; are delivered with the sincere reverence of true bluegrass fanatics.\n\nSoaring multi-part harmonies; fiddle, guitar, banjo, bass, and mandolin lines that seamlessly intertwine with a good-time feel; and exceptionally solid musicianship round out the ten-track effort. \n\nFans of the Grateful Dead&amp;#039;s jolly throwback tunes should already have this in their collection, but even those put off by the member&amp;#039;s psychedelic resumÃƒÂ©s will find that Old &amp; in the Way is nothing of the sort. \n\nThis is the sound of purists re-creating the music they grew up with and it&amp;#039;s both enjoyable and inspiring to listen to. Like American Beauty and Workingman&amp;#039;s Dead, this record showcases Garcia going back to his roots, and it shows that he and his buddies have more than the chops required to live up to their legend. ?
