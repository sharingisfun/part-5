The events that followed changed her life forever. Twelve years later, the woman now known as Abigail Lowery lives alone on the outskirts of a small town in the Ozarks. A freelance programmer, she works at home designing sophisticated security systems. Her own security is supplemented by a fierce dog and an assortment of firearms. She keeps to herself, saying little, revealing nothing. Unfortunately, that seems to be the quickest way to get attention in a tiny southern town. The mystery of Abigail Lowery intrigues local police chief Brooks Gleason, on both a personal and a professional level. Her sharp, logical mind, her secretive nature, her unromantic viewpoints leave him fascinated but frustrated. He suspects that Abigail needs protection from something, even if he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what Ã¢â‚¬â€ and that her elaborate defenses hide a story that must be revealed. Accustomed to two-bit troublemakers, Gleason is about to walk into the sights of very powerful and dangerous men. And Abigail Lowery, who has built a life based on security and self-control, is at risk of losing both.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58c948a49c9a43768d8092d3c8cdba2eb5e65b6a","amp;dn":"Nora+Roberts+-+The+Witness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58c948a49c9a43768d8092d3c8cdba2eb5e65b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,201,72,164,156,154,67,118,141,128,146,211,200,205,186,46,181,230,91,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
