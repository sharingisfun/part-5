His second novel, Midnight's Children (1981), won the Booker Prize in 1981. Much of his fiction is set on the Indian subcontinent. He is said to combine magical realism with historical fiction; his work is concerned with the many connections, disruptions and migrations between East and West.\n\nHis fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988), was the centre of a major controversy, provoking protests from Muslims in several countries. Death threats were made against him, including a fatwÃ„ï¿½ issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, on 14 February 1989. Rushdie was appointed Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France in January 1999. In June 2007, Queen Elizabeth II knighted him for his services to literature. In 2008, The Times ranked him thirteenth on its list of the fifty greatest British writers since 1945.\n\nSince 2000, Rushdie has lived in the United States, where he has worked at Emory University and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2012, he published Joseph Anton: A Memoir, an account of his life in the wake of the controversy over The Satanic Verses.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n\n      Children's Book\n\n* Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990)\n\n* Luka and the Fire of Life (2010)\n\n\n      Collections\n\n* East, West (1994)\n\n\n      Essays and Non-fiction\n\n* Joseph Anton - A Memoir (2012)\n\n* Step Across This Line Collected - Nonfiction 1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2002 (2002)\n\n* The Jaguar Smile - A Nicaraguan Journey (1987)\n\n\n      Novels\n\n* Fury (2001)\n\n* Grimus (1975)\n\n* Midnight's Children (1981)\n\n* Shalimar the Clown (2005)\n\n* Shame (1983)\n\n* The Enchantress of Florence (2008)\n\n* The Ground Beneath Her Feet (1999)\n\n* The Moor's Last Sigh (1995)\n\n* The Satanic Verses (1988)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.salman-rushdie.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.salman-rushdie.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5531/the-art-of-fiction-no-186-salman-rushdie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5531/the-art-of-fiction-no-186-salman-rushdie&lt;/a&gt;\t\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/digital-life-salman-rushdie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/digital-life-salman-rushdie&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167f78951d04a7e53b54b1eaff74a1c27c6dead6","amp;dn":"Salman+Rushdie+-+Fiction+%26amp%3B+Non-Fiction+%2815+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167f78951d04a7e53b54b1eaff74a1c27c6dead6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,127,120,149,29,4,167,229,59,84,177,234,255,116,161,194,124,109,234,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
