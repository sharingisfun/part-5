Following a tried-and-tested concept, this guide has been developed over several years in training courses for biotech and chemical engineers in Europe and the U.S. The first part deals with the theory, introducing chromatography and its dynamics, as well as discussing mass transfer and dispersion effects. The second part then goes on to cover equipment and protocols, determining the retention factor and HETP from isocratic and elution experiments, as well as the mass transfer and intraparticle diffusivity from batch and shallow-bed adsorption experiments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a6d47a648baae90285cadb29c3bbdceba1d65b","amp;dn":"Protein+Chromatography+-+Process+Development+and+Scale-Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a6d47a648baae90285cadb29c3bbdceba1d65b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,166,212,122,100,139,170,233,2,133,202,219,41,195,187,220,235,161,214,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
