If you can imagine yourself in any of the following categories, this book is for you!\n\nSave on Your Rent Payment\n\nIn hard times, one of the best ways to cut expenses quickly and for as long as you need relief, is to stop paying rent. True, even an old truck or cargo trailer will cost something, but often these pay for themselves in less than a year. A bonus is that when you sell it, you may get the major part of your money back.\n\nLow-Cost Vacations\n\nThe cost of lodging, even on a three-week vacation, can easily run up to $2,000 or more. However, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a light-weight fiberglass or converted cargo trailerÃ¢â‚¬â€set up for cookingÃ¢â‚¬â€even a two or three month holiday may be affordable.\n\nPermanent living\n\nTens of thousands of Americans and Canadians live full time in a motorhome. There are prices for all budgets, from just over $2,000 to well over $1,000,000!\n\nHigh Adventure\n\nTravel up the Alaska HighwayÃ¢â‚¬â€a trip you will never forget!\n\nPersonal Privacy\n\nThe quickest way to assure yourself of total privacy is to travel in a van, trailer, truck or motorhome. This is called Travel on the QT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f03948bef25dc757331a6106662aafc9a2faf431","amp;dn":"Off.The.Grid.Live.in.a.Van.Trailer.Truck.or.Motorhome.J.J.Luna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f03948bef25dc757331a6106662aafc9a2faf431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,57,72,190,242,93,199,87,51,26,97,6,102,42,175,201,162,250,244,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
