Learn how to use this incredibly sophisticated 3D modeling and rendering program to visualize almost anything you can imagine.â€¨â€¨In this course, author Scott Onstott shows you how to build walls, doors, windows, stairs, railings, moldings, cloth, pottery, furniture, grass, trees, landscapes, and much more, using splines, modifiers, Booleans, and NURBS modeling. You'll also learn to texture-map objects, light them with both direct and indirect illumination, place virtual cameras, render, and animate scenes.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with files and objects from other programs\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating parametric AEC objects\r\n\tâ€¢\tTracing splines\r\n\tâ€¢\tLathing a 2D profile\r\n\tâ€¢\tDesigning spline-based walls and windows\r\n\tâ€¢\tDeforming objects with modifiers\r\n\tâ€¢\tAttaching, grouping, and compounding\r\n\tâ€¢\tSculpting and painting landscapes\r\n\tâ€¢\tSimulating fabric, grass, and foliage\r\n\tâ€¢\tNURBS modeling\r\n\tâ€¢\tTexture mapping and designing materials\r\n\tâ€¢\tPlacing virtual cameras\r\n\tâ€¢\tRendering images\r\n\tâ€¢\tAnimating a camera along a flight path\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48010c1b47161180540c0b2f4b0b58237aabb729","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+3ds+Max+for+Design+Visualization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48010c1b47161180540c0b2f4b0b58237aabb729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,1,12,27,71,22,17,128,84,12,11,47,75,11,88,35,122,171,183,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
