Then I realized I can't take highlights and notes so I was like wtf?\n\nI COULD access the books on the Kindle though, and ended up stripping the DRM off it and converting it to an EPUB that I can use with my iBooks. All so that I can use highlights and take notes. Lol\n\nThis is a pretty good EPUB version as good as an official one will be, since its converted from a Kindle version NOT a half assed OCR PDF, so enjoy. You can probably convert it to PDF using Calibre if that's your style.\n\nThere is a mobi format as well but I haven't tested it. It was created with Calibre fyi.\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfb2ffc92acc7d1fde3d32a56a2bfa8b1c12ea06","amp;dn":"The+Four+Steps+to+the+Epiphany+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfb2ffc92acc7d1fde3d32a56a2bfa8b1c12ea06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,178,255,201,42,204,125,31,222,61,50,165,106,43,250,139,28,18,234,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
