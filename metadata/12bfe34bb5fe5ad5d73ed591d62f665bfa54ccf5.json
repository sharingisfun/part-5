Includes:\n\n    * Two Steps From Hell: Volume 1 (2006)\n    * Shadows and Nightmares (2006)\n    * Dynasty (2007)\n    * All Drums Go To Hell (2007)\n    * Pathogen (2007)\n    * Nemesis (2007)\n    * Dreams &amp; Imaginations (2007)\n    * Legend (2008)\n    * Ashes (2008)\n    * The Devil Wears Nada (2009)\n    * Power of Darkness (2010)\n    * Invincible (2010)\n    * All Drones Go To Hell (2010)\n    * Illumina (2010)\n\n&quot;Two Steps From Hell is a production music company based in Santa Monica, California. Founded by Nick Phoenix and Thomas J. Bergersen, the company produces music for movie trailers.\n\nIn particular, the group's music has been used in trailers for such films as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Star Trek, The Dark Knight, 2012, X-Men: The Last Stand, Tron Legacy, Avatar, Prince of Persia, Stardust, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Inception and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader as well as video games such as Mass Effect 2 and the British television show Doctor Who.\n\nOf their albums, only Invincible has been released to the public. Illusions, formerly known as Nemesis II, will be released publicly under Bergersen's name.&quot;\n\nIn my opinion, this is the the best of all the production studios. Also popular and extremely talented are E.S. Posthumus, Immediate Music, Globus, and X-Ray Dog. \n\nIF YOU LIKE THEM, BUY SOME OF THEIR STUFF. THEY COULD DESPERATELY USE SOME SUPPORT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12bfe34bb5fe5ad5d73ed591d62f665bfa54ccf5","amp;dn":"Two+Steps+From+Hell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12bfe34bb5fe5ad5d73ed591d62f665bfa54ccf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,191,227,75,181,254,90,213,215,62,213,145,214,47,102,91,250,84,204,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
