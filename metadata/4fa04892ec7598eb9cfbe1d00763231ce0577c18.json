Richard Cooper is in the middle, with a good job in Manhattan, a house in the suburbs, and two cute children with Brenda, his intelligent, good-looking wife whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a teacher. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no sex in this seven-year marriage, so RichardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bored. Into the mix walks Nikki, a sexy, sassy, single friend heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not seen in years. Nikki has problems and finds a reason to stop at his office every day. He tries to help, they have some fun, and he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mention Nikki to Brenda. His work and reputation suffer. Is he about to scratch the seven year itch? What choices does Richard have?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770772/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770772/&lt;/a&gt;\nGenre: Comedy | Drama | Romance\niMDB Rating: 5,5/10 from 11 007 users\nDirector: Chris Rock\nStarring: Chris Rock, Kerry Washington, Gina Torres\n\n\nSource Used: I Think I Love My Wife 2007 720p WEB-DL DD5.1 H.264-CtrlHD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fa04892ec7598eb9cfbe1d00763231ce0577c18","amp;dn":"I+Think+I+Love+My+Wife+2007+720p+WEBRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fa04892ec7598eb9cfbe1d00763231ce0577c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,160,72,146,236,117,152,235,156,251,225,208,7,99,35,28,224,87,124,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
