A new chapter on the history of economics itself has been added, and the implications of that history examined. A new section on the special role of corporations in the economy has been added to the chapter on government and big business, among other additions throughout the book.\nBasic Economics, which has now been translated into six languages, has grown so much that a large amount of material in the back of the book in previous editions has now been put online instead, so the book itself and its price will not have to expand. The central idea of Basic Economics, however, remains the same: that the fundamental facts and principles of economics do not require jargon, graphs, or equations, and can be learned in a relaxed and even enjoyable way.\n\nHardcover: 786 pages \nPublisher: Basic Books; Fourth Edition edition (December 28, 2010) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04213bf5e4b665f0f4e327f1a4ef955a2d1e0165","amp;dn":"Basic+Economics+4th+ed+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04213bf5e4b665f0f4e327f1a4ef955a2d1e0165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,33,59,245,228,182,101,240,244,227,39,241,164,239,149,90,45,30,1,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
