A history of lives lived intensely at a time when the world was changing profoundly, the book takes readers on a journey that crosses cultures and boundaries from ancient Greece and ancient Egypt to the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nDrawing on his prodigious knowledge of the ancient world and his keen sense of the periodâ€™s military and political history, Goldsworthy creates a singular portrait of the iconic lovers. â€œAntony and Cleopatra were first and foremost political animals,â€ explains Goldsworthy, who places politics and ideology at the heart of their storied romance. Undertaking a close analysis of ancient sources and archaeological evidence, Goldsworthy bridges the gaps of current scholarship and dispels misconceptions that have entered the popular consciousness. He explains why Cleopatra was consistently portrayed by Hollywood as an Egyptian, even though she was really Greek, and argues that Antony had far less military experience than anyone would suspect from reading Shakespeare and other literature. Goldsworthy makes an important case for understanding Antony as a powerful Roman senator and political force in his own right","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c1785f8bf43fac8dbe618b50cb906eee44d9c52","amp;dn":"Antony+and+Cleopatra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c1785f8bf43fac8dbe618b50cb906eee44d9c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,23,133,248,191,67,250,200,219,230,24,181,12,185,6,238,228,77,156,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
