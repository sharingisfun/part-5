After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. \n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91fcf48bfb8d1f10efecf9cd9f2b2cd93e406919","amp;dn":"Oscar+Wilde+-+The+Importance+Of+Being+Earnest++%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91fcf48bfb8d1f10efecf9cd9f2b2cd93e406919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,252,244,139,251,141,31,16,239,236,249,205,159,43,44,217,62,64,105,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
