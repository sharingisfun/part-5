More similarities in past decades were found than had been thought; the thread throughout Rost's book is that leadership was conceived of as &quot;good management.&quot; He develops a new definition and paradigm for leadership in this volume that distinguishes leadership from management in fundamental ways. The ethics of leadership from a postindustrial perspective completes the paradigm. The book concludes with suggestions that can be immediately utilized in helping to transform our understanding of leadership.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c5dd4fa57100b60a8037f32639a3730f2ebe107","amp;dn":"Leadership+for+the+Twenty-First+Century","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c5dd4fa57100b60a8037f32639a3730f2ebe107","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,93,212,250,87,16,11,96,168,3,127,50,99,154,55,48,242,235,225,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
