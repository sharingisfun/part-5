It comes less than a year after &quot;Pull My Chain&quot;, but do not let the suddeness of it fool you: this CD is worth every penny you put into it, and more.\n\nKeith, as always, makes sure he covers a wide range of tempos and melodies. Love ballads--&quot;Losing My Touch&quot;, &quot;Rock You Baby&quot;, &quot;That's Not How It Is&quot;, &quot;Rodeo Moon&quot; (sort of)--are mixed in with easy-rollers like &quot;It's All Good&quot;, &quot;Huckleberry&quot;, and &quot;Ain't It Just Like You&quot;. Thrown into the mix are some rockers &quot;The Angry American&quot;, &quot;Who's Your Daddy?&quot;, &quot;Good To Go To Mexico&quot;, and &quot;Beer For My Horses&quot;.\n\nThe topics are equally diversified. &quot;The Angry American,&quot; as if you haven't heard it, is about the anger and hatred we felt on 9-11..captured by a man that felt the same way. &quot;Good To Go To Mexico&quot; is about that vacation we all need in our lives. &quot;Beer For My Horses&quot;, a duet with the one and only Willie Nelson, is about obtaining justice when justice is necessary. &quot;Huckleberry&quot; is a song about the beauty of puppy love, and &quot;Rodeo Moon&quot; (co-written by Chris LeDoux) covers the life of a traveling rodeo star and his wife. The album ends with an introduction of &quot;The Angry American&quot;, and an explanation of why Keith wrote it.\n\nToby Keith's songwriting skills abound here, as he wrote or co-wrote all twelve of the tunes (not counting the final track). All his wit, anger, love, fear, and anxieties are transfered to your ears through his music. Those headphones can carry a lot, can't they?\n\nAlright, alright, I'll end this. Here is the point: This is THE album of the summer of 2002!\n\n\n\nToby Keith - Unleashed\n\nArtist...............: Toby Keith\nAlbum................: Unleashed\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2002\n\nMP3 320cbr\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.
