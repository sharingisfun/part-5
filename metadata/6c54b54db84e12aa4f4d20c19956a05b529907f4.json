Fletcher L. Prouty - The Secret Team - The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World 2003\r\n\r\nThe Secret Team, L. Fletcher Proutyâ€™s exposeÂ´ of the CIAâ€™s brutal methods of maintaining national security during the Cold War, was first published in the 1970s. However, virtually all copies of the book disappeared upon distribution, having been purchased en masse by shady â€œprivate buyers.â€ Certainly, Proutyâ€™s allegationsâ€”such as how the U-2 Crisis of 1960 was fixed to sabotage Eisenhowerâ€“Khrushchev talkâ€”cannot have pleased the CIA. The Secret Team appears once more with a new introduction by Jesse Ventura","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c54b54db84e12aa4f4d20c19956a05b529907f4","amp;dn":"Col.+Fletcher+L.+Prouty+-+The+Secret+Team+-+The+CIA+and+Its+Alli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c54b54db84e12aa4f4d20c19956a05b529907f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,84,181,77,184,78,18,170,79,77,32,193,153,86,160,91,82,153,7,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
