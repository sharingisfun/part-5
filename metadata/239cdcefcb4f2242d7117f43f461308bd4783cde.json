Now he delivers a provocative novel of a man who stumbles upon the discovery of a lifetime-or many lifetimes.\n\nGrad-school dropout Matt Fuller is toiling as a lowly research assistant at MIT when, while measuring subtle quantum forces that relate to time changes in gravity and electromagnetic force, his calibrator turns into a time machine. With a dead-end job and a girlfriend who has left him for another man, Matt has nothing to lose taking a time machine trip himself-or so he thinks.\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:239cdcefcb4f2242d7117f43f461308bd4783cde","amp;dn":"Joe+Haldeman+-+The+Accidental+Time+Machine+%5BFIXED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"239cdcefcb4f2242d7117f43f461308bd4783cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,156,220,239,203,79,34,66,215,17,127,67,244,97,48,139,212,120,60,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
