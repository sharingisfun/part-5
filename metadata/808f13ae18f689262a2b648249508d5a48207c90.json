Clocking up six top ten\nsingles and three top ten albums, the nation was\nimmersed in ?Antmania? with every release and its\ndandy imagery.\n\nFormed in London in early 1977, the band staged a\nmuch darker and submissive act. Performing to a\nmainly purist punk (and cult following) audience\naround bars and clubs in the UK, as well as Europe,\nAdam Ant and his band had stapled their influence\nfrom early glam and the distant UK Punk scene.\nTowing a controversial and daring reputation and a\nstring of modest independent singles (Young\nParisians, Zerox, Cartrouble) the band recorded\ndebut album &amp;#039; Dirk Wears White Sox&amp;#039; (1979) to mixed\nreaction. Although the record had strong motives it\nstruggled to get mainstream attention resulting in\nthe groups break up and a creative refit.\n\nFronting new tribal warrior make over and a Burundi\nmeets Link Ray sound, the group reappeared in early\n1980 armed with a major record deal and single\n&amp;#039;Kings Of The Frontier&amp;#039;. The groups new mouldings\ngained them a new audience and with follow ups &amp;#039;Dog\nEat Dog&amp;#039; &amp; &amp;#039;Antmusic&amp;#039; breaking the top ten, Adam And\nThe Ants had ultimately arrived. The hits kept\ncoming in force and with soaring number one singles;\nStand &amp; Deliver, Prince Charming, albums; Kings Of\nThe Wild Frontier, Prince Charming and inspired\nvideos, the bands appeal crossed to international\nacclaim.\n\nSteering a gruelling year of promotion and touring\nthe band folded with Adam announcing a solo career.\nHitting a promising start with lead single &amp;#039;Goody\nTwo Shoes&amp;#039; reaching the number one spot, Adam&amp;#039;s\nsuccess shone well into the mid 80s with modest\nsingle and album releases and a supportive music and\nacting career.\n\nAdam And The Ants still remain an important and\ninfluential link to the present and this collection\nis a firm overspill of the bands major and minor\nglories. Essential.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:808f13ae18f689262a2b648249508d5a48207c90","amp;dn":"Adam+And+The+Ants+-+Stand+And+Deliver+The+Very+Best+Of+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"808f13ae18f689262a2b648249508d5a48207c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,143,19,174,24,246,137,38,42,43,100,130,73,80,141,90,72,32,124,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
