Electricity and energy donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to come off the public utility gridÃ¢â‚¬â€alternatives abound in solar, wind, and water generated power. Design decisions can drastically affect power consumption, and bio-diesel and alternative fuels can help break the oil habit. Dave Black describes alternatives for eco-pimping your home and lifestyle for independence, economy, and a more integrated way of life. Equally valuable for the urban dweller vaguely concerned about the size of his or her carbon footprint and the rural self-sufficiency enthusiast, Living Off the Grid can help anyone take control of his or her life and way of living. 50 black-and-white illustrations\n\n\nBy David Black\nPublished by Skyhorse Publishing in 2008\nEPUB, 288 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc30893fdc9a5b0af7802271b652d664cfd3133b","amp;dn":"Living+off+the+Grid+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc30893fdc9a5b0af7802271b652d664cfd3133b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,48,137,63,220,154,91,10,247,128,34,113,182,82,214,100,207,211,19,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
