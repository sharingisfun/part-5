Goes deeper into metaphysical aspects and connects ancient hidden myths and history with modern ways of society and political outcome. Explains shamanism, duality, and reality behind DNAs and modern false beliefs. Overall, Kymatica is another excellent movie which attempts to point out the fundamental misconception that humankind are facing today that has resulted in imbalance between planet, nature and species.\n\nTrailer ()\n\nI ripped this from YouTube and has the resolution for the \niPod/iPhone, but it's in .avi format\n\n***All credit goes to Ben Stewart the producer of this film\n\n\nP.S\n\nCheck out Zeitgeist &amp; Zeitgeist Addendum \nby Peter Joseph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8410f1ce13ac54b6e763645bdcd617a38f8dddba","amp;dn":"Kymatica+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8410f1ce13ac54b6e763645bdcd617a38f8dddba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,16,241,206,19,172,84,182,231,99,100,91,220,214,23,163,143,141,221,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
