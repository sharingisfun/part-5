LayOut in SketchUp Pro lets you add model views to pages, choose drawing scales, adjust line weights, and add dimensions, callouts, and graphics. Make a change to your SketchUp model, and find it reflected automatically in LayOut. And when itâ€™s time, export pages as PDFs, images and CAD files.\r\n\r\nFind a 3D model of anything\r\n\r\nWhy model everything from scratch? Whether itâ€™s a chair for the room youâ€™re designing or a rhino for your zoo, youâ€™ll find anything you need in 3D Warehouse, the worldâ€™s biggest library of free 3D models. And anyone can use 3D Warehouse to store and share models. Upload your best work and become a SketchUp legend.\r\n\r\nCustomize Your SketchUp\r\n\r\nExtensions are add-on tools built to solve the kind of modeling problems that might otherwise leave you scratching your head. And there are hundreds for you to explore.\r\nBrowse Extension Warehouse https://extensions.sketchup.com/\r\n\r\nSketchUp Hardware and software requirements\r\n\r\nLike many computer programs, SketchUp Pro require certain hardware and software specifications in order to install and run.\r\nThese are basic requirements, though, so you may want to use our recommended suggestions to improve performance.\r\nThe following list of requirements and recommendations apply to SketchUp Pro 2016, SketchUp Make and all previous versions of SketchUp:\r\n\r\nWindows 10, Windows 8+ and Windows 7+\r\n\r\nSoftware\r\n\r\n- MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer 9.0 or higher.\r\n- SketchUp Pro requires .NET Framework version 4.0.
