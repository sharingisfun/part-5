Smith&amp;#039;s black-and-white drawings are inspired by animated cartoons and comic strips, a notable influence being Walt Kelly&amp;#039;s Pogo. He stated in an interview &quot;I was also a big fan of Carl Barks and Pogo, so it was just natural for me to want to draw that kind of mixture of Walt Kelly and Mobius&quot;. However, the story contains both light-hearted comedy and dark, epic fantasy, drawing inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien and others. Different characters are drawn in widely different styles, reflecting Bone&amp;#039;s diversity of tone.\n\nBone has received numerous awards, among them ten Eisner Awards and eleven Harvey Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great comic.  Included are:\n*Scholastic Books 1-4 (compiling Bone 1-27)\n*Bone 28-55\n*Bone Holiday Special\n*Rose\n*Stupid Stupid Rat-Tails\n*Trilogy Tour &amp;#039;97 - Jeff Smith, Linda Medley &amp; Charles Vess\n\n\nAll that are missing are:\n*Thorn: Tales From the Lantern\n*Bone #13 1/2\n*Bone Sourcebook  \n*Bone #1 Tenth Anniversary Edition \nall of which are pretty darn rare.  If you have a copy of any of them (scanned or in print, i may be interested in buying), please let me know!\n\n\nEnjoy!
