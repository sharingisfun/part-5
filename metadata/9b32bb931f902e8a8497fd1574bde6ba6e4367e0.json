It is a guide for professionals and students wanting a deeper understanding of how to manage credit exposures. The Handbook provides a detailed roadmap for managing beyond the financial analysis of individual transactions and counterparties. Written in a straightforward and accessible style, the authors outline how to manage a portfolio of credit exposures--from origination and assessment of credit fundamentals to hedging and pricing. The Handbook is relevant for corporations, pension funds, endowments, asset managers, banks and insurance companies alike.\n\nCovers the four essential aspects of credit risk management: Origination, Credit Risk Assessment, Portfolio Management and Risk Transfer.\nProvides ample references to and examples of credit market services as a resource for those readers having credit risk responsibilities.\nDesigned for busy professionals as well as finance, risk management and MBA students.\nAs financial transactions grow more complex, proactive management of credit portfolios is no longer optional for an institution, but a matter of survival.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPreface xiii\n\nAcknowledgments xxi\n\nPart One Origination\n\nChapter 1 Fundamentals of Credit Risk 3\n\nWhat Is Credit Risk?
