Tracks 10 and 11 were originally released on the B side of the single Take Me To The Other Side \n\nThe Perfect Prescription is the second studio album by Spacemen 3. It is a concept album, &quot;a vision of a drug trip from inception to its blasted conclusion, highs and lows fully intact.&quot;\nThe music becomes progressively more orchestral and serene until the high of the trip, represented by &quot;Ecstasy Symphony&quot;/&quot;Transparent Radiation (Flashback),&quot; moving on to the moment of realisation\nwhere the high has faded and the comedown ensues, represented by the harsh opening guitar chords in &quot;Things'll Never Be the Same.&quot; Coming down is represented in the blues based &quot;Come Down Easy,&quot; whilst the potentially fatal \neffects of an overdose are portrayed in the final track &quot;Call the Doctor.&quot; The music was written by the band except &quot;Transparent Radiation&quot; which is a Red Krayola cover from their 1967 album Parable of Arable Land. The band\nalso borrow heavily from the gospel standard covered by Bob Dylan, &quot;In My Time of Dying,&quot; for &quot;Come Down Easy&quot; and pay homage to Lou Reed in &quot;Ode to Street Hassle.&quot;\n\n&quot;If there has ever been an untrumpeted classic, here it is&quot;: Unknown \n\nRipped from my personal copy, smoke a fat one and enjoy. Beolab. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e27eae426b1a2582636f9841a8908516922848","amp;dn":"Spacemen+3+-+The+Perfect+Prescription+%281989%29+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e27eae426b1a2582636f9841a8908516922848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,226,126,174,66,107,26,37,130,99,111,152,65,168,144,133,22,146,40,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
