It does so with a unique approach that combines fundamentals first with objects early. The book transitions smoothly through a carefully selected set of procedural programming fundamentals to object-oriented fundamentals. During this early transition and beyond, the book emphasizes problem solving. For example, Chapter 2 is devoted to algorithm development, Chapter 8 is devoted to program design, and problem-solving sections appear throughout the book. Problem-solving skills are fostered with the help of an interactive, iterative presentation style: Here's the problem. How can we solve it? How can we improve the solution?. \n\n\nMore information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Java-Problem-Approach/dp/0073047023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Java-Problem-Approach/dp/0073047023&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8156ee47a015843ada544a62fd47da8fdc764768","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Programming+in+Java+-+An+Interdisciplinary+Appro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8156ee47a015843ada544a62fd47da8fdc764768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,86,238,71,160,21,132,58,218,84,74,98,253,71,218,143,220,118,71,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
