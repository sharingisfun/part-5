In this course, photographer and author Ben Long explores the concepts of composition, from basics such as the rule of thirds to more advanced topics such as the way the eye travels through a photo.\nThe course addresses how the camera differs from the eye and introduces composition fundamentals, such as balance and point of view. Ben also examines the importance of geometry, light, and color in composition, and looks at how composition can be improved with a variety of post-production techniques. Interspersed throughout the course are workshop sessions that capture the creative energy of a group of photography students; shooting assignments and exercises; and analyses of the work of photographers Paul Taggart and Connie Imboden.\n\n[b]Topics include:[/b]\n* Looking versus seeing\n* Understanding when and why to use black and white\n* Analyzing lines\n* Arranging the elements into lines and shapes\n* Working with perspective and symmetry\n* Changing focal length, camera position, and depth\n* Dividing rectangular frames into thirds\n* Weighting the corners in square pictures\n* Composing photographs of people\n* Composing landscape photos\n* Working with light: direction, texture, and negative space\n* How to shoot color\n* Guiding the viewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye\n* Controlling depth\n* Improving composition in post-production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42bf2d453fe7e86fdf580d1d395121dcb7250250","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Foundations+of+Photography+%3A+Composition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42bf2d453fe7e86fdf580d1d395121dcb7250250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,191,45,69,63,231,232,111,223,88,13,29,57,81,33,220,183,37,2,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
