The thinnish plot finds inveterate film fan Jerry making a cross-country journey to Tinseltown for the purpose of meeting his favorite screen star, the buxom Anita Ekberg (the film's title, need it be added, has a double meaning). Dean goes along for the ride, hoping to expand his bankroll during a Las Vegas stopover. The boys are joined by a third traveller, an enormous Great Dane named Mr. Bascomb; along the way, the trio becomes a quartet when pretty Pat Crowley hitches a ride. The finale takes place in Hollywood, naturally, as Jerry wreaks havoc at a film studio which looks suspiciously like Paramount. All reports indicate that Hollywood and Bust was an unhappy shoot, with Jerry Lewis behaving so obstreperously that director Frank Tashlin ordered him off the set and told him to go home until he learned to behave himself; to this day, Lewis cannot bring himself to watch the film. Happily, the animosity between the two stars never comes across on screen, and as a result Hollywood or Bust is a most enjoyable diversion.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049322/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049322/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 325 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,05 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ac9ed3e95fb4082c71a78ed385ce6ff9f11016","amp;dn":"Hollywood+or+Bust+%281956%29+Dean+Martin%2C+Jerry+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ac9ed3e95fb4082c71a78ed385ce6ff9f11016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,172,158,211,233,95,180,8,44,113,167,142,211,133,206,111,249,241,16,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
