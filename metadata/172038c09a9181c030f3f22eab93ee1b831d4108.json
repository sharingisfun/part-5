Described as &quot;the father of history&quot; by Cicero, Herodotus was the first historian known to collect his materials systematically, test their accuracy to a certain extent, and arrange them in a well-constructed and vivid narrative.\n\nTHE HISTORIES is his masterpiece and the only work he is known to have produced.  It is a record of his &quot;inquiry&quot; into the origins of the Greco-Persian wars, compelled by his desire to &quot;prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time.&quot;  Much more than military history, the book provides the fullest portrait of the classical world of the 5th and 6th centuries.\n\n\nThe following three translations are in ePUB format:\n\n* THE HISTORIES (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics, 2004).  Translated by G. C. Macauley and revised throughout by Donald Lateiner; Introduction and Notes by Donald Lateiner.\n\n* THE HISTORIES (Oxford World's Classics, 1998).  Translated by Robin Waterfield, with an Introduction and Notes by Carolyn Dewald.\n\n* THE LANDMARK HERODOTUS: The Histories (Pantheon, 2007).  Translated by Andrea L. Purvis with Maps, Annotations, Appendices, and Encyclopedic Index; edited by Robert B. Strassler.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:172038c09a9181c030f3f22eab93ee1b831d4108","amp;dn":"Herodotus+-+The+Histories+%283+translations%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"172038c09a9181c030f3f22eab93ee1b831d4108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,32,56,192,154,145,129,192,48,243,242,46,171,147,238,27,131,29,65,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
