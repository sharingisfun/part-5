While not as challenging as traditional rhythm games, the game is pretty relaxing, and can be pretty hectic too depending on the songs. Has an editor for user created levels and songs, as well as an Auto-Gen feature which allows players to insert any mp3 into the game and the game automatically creates a level based on the music file, similar once again to the auto generator of Beat Hazard and Audiosurf.\n\nInstructions:\n1.)Extract archives\n2.)Run soundodgerplus.exe\n3.)Dodge those beats like your dancing on fire!
