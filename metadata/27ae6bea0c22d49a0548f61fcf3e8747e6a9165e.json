Many people don't have access to knowledge which might raise their level of life. \n\nThere are 2 OU courses I have uploaded so far:\n\n1. M255 - Object-Oriented Programming With Java - Units 1-14\n2. M257 - Putting JAVA to work - Units 1-12\n\nIf you have an access to other Java (and other IT) courses from the OU, like:\n\nSoftware engineering (TM354)\nMy digital life (TU100)\nAlgorithms, data structures and computability (M269)\nWeb technologies (TT284)\nCisco networking (CCNA) (T216)\nObject-oriented Java programming (M250)\nSoftware development with Java (M256)\nFundamentals of interaction design (M364)\nDeveloping concurrent distributed systems (M362)\nBuilding blocks of software (M263)\n\n\nPLEASE SHARE!!!\n\n\n\n===============================\n\n\n\nSince its introduction, Java has become one of the most widely used computer languages. Initially riding on the crest of the rapid expansion of the internet, Java has established itself as a tremendously versatile programming language which is able to run on a wide variety of computer platforms.\nJava can be used to build systems that power applications such as e-commerce, online games, downloadable music and online banking. Java runs on PCs, laptops and mobile devices (including phones, PDAs and tablets) and can be found in TV set-top boxes, in embedded devices (forming part of larger systems such as cars, robots or printers), in smart cards and even in wearable computers.\nThe module will show you how, through the concept of Java editions, Java can be used in all of the platforms mentioned above. Java editions cater for the different needs and resources of, say, large international e-commerce systems running on extensive networks with many servers, and games software running on mobile phones with very limited hardware resources. The module is mostly interested in the Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) but you will also be introduced to the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME), designed for use on smaller systems with limited resources (such as mobile phones).\nThe module will provide a broad coverage of the Java programming language from primitive data types and control structures, through graphical user interface (GUI) construction and event handling, to topics such as threaded programming and basic internet programming using sockets. Although the module will concentrate on producing stand-alone applications, it will also show you how the skills and knowledge that you develop are directly transferable to web-based systems through the use of applets and also to mobile phone systems through the use of MIDlets. The module will also touch on topics such as Java on servers (servlets) and even the idea of Java code roaming the internet through the use of aglets. \n\n\nAims\nThe module aims to:\nreinforce the fundamental aspects of object-oriented technology;\ndescribe how these concepts are implemented in Java;\nprovide the knowledge necessary to construct Java programs;\ndescribe a number of the advanced facilities of Java including exceptions and internet-based applications;\nshow the implications of implementing Java applications on a range of platforms;\nshow how Java can be used in developing non-trivial programs.\nLearning outcomes\nM257 provides opportunities for you to achieve the following general learning outcomes.\nKnowledge and understanding\n\nAfter studying the module, you will be able to demonstrate:\nan understanding of the design and programming processes;\nsome knowledge of the main constructs and mechanisms in Java;\nan appreciation of the implications of implementing Java applications on a range of platforms;\ntechniques used in developing a large Java program.\nCognitive skills\n\nAfter studying the module, you will be able to:\ndescribe and apply key concepts and techniques in software design and development;\nanalyse and abstract away from the details of a problem;\ndesign and formulate an appropriate solution to a problem and evaluate it.\nKey skills\n\nAfter studying the module, you will be able to:\nfind information from a range of sources to support a task;\nplan complex tasks;\nuse new Java libraries;\nuse appropriate numerical, mathematical and abstraction skills;\nprogress to more advanced-level studies.\nPractical and/or professional skills\n\nAfter studying the module, you will be able to:\nassemble, program, develop, test and evaluate software systems;\nuse software tools such as a Java IDE;\nuse appropriate programming skills;\ndevelop user interfaces appropriate for particular platforms.\n\n\n3.2 Summary of M257 units\nThere are twelve module units and they are as follows:\nUnit 1 Java everywhere\nUnit 2 Java in the small\nUnit 3 Java in the large\nUnit 4 Input, output and exceptions\nUnit 5 Packages and abstraction\nUnit 6 Graphical user interfaces\nUnit 7 Event-driven programming\nUnit 8 Threads\nUnit 9 Internet programming\nUnit 10 Ã¢â‚¬â„¢lets do Java\nUnit 11 Web-based case studies\nUnit 12 Web-based case study","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27ae6bea0c22d49a0548f61fcf3e8747e6a9165e","amp;dn":"m257+-+Putting+Java+to+Work+-+The+Open+University+-+s0ryt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27ae6bea0c22d49a0548f61fcf3e8747e6a9165e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,174,107,234,12,34,212,154,5,72,246,31,207,62,135,71,230,169,22,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
