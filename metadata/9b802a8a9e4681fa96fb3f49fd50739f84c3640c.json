Slip Slidin' Slim\n\nGuitar lovers will flip over this reissue's new bonus tracks: a conversation in which Stevie Ray Vaughan extols the virtues of Jimi Hendrix's playing and then essays them all in a medley of &amp;quot;Little Wing/Third Stone From the Sun.&amp;quot; There's also the brief slide-guitar instrumental &amp;quot;Slip Slidin' Slim.&amp;quot; What's breathtaking about these and the 10 remastered cuts that were the original 1985 album are the remarkably live amplifier tones. It sounds as though Vaughan's plugged directly into your stereo--especially at the climax of &amp;quot;Little Wing,&amp;quot; where his Stratocaster feeds back through a wall of spinning Leslie speakers in a fit of psychedelic bliss. Otherwise, this CD still seems like a creative holding pattern for Vaughan, despite the addition of keyboardist Reese Wynans to broaden his band's palette. Nonetheless, the prophetic &amp;quot;Change It,&amp;quot; which foreshadowed Vaughan's recovery from addiction by a year, and his in-concert staples &amp;quot;Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Life Without You&amp;quot; debut here.\n\nSRV!!!\n\nNext Relese: SRV - 1999 - In Step (1989)  [Remastered] [Bonus Tracks]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b802a8a9e4681fa96fb3f49fd50739f84c3640c","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan++-+1999+-+Soul+To+Soul+%281985%29+%5BRemastered%5D+%5BB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b802a8a9e4681fa96fb3f49fd50739f84c3640c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,128,42,138,158,70,129,250,150,251,63,73,253,80,115,159,132,195,100,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
