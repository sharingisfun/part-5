They set unmatched standards for close, two-part harmonies and infused early rock &amp; roll with some of the best elements of country and pop music. Their legacy was and is felt enormously in all rock acts that employ harmonies as prime features, from the Beatles, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and legions of country-rockers to modern-day roots rockers like Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe (who once recorded an EP of Everlys songs together).Don (born February 1, 1937) and Phil (born January 19, 1939) were professionals way before their teens, schooled by their accomplished guitarist father Ike, and singing with their family on radio broadcasts in Iowa. In the mid-'50s, they made a brief stab at conventional Nashville country with Columbia. When their single flopped, they were cast adrift for quite a while until they latched onto Cadence. Don invested their first single for the label, &quot;Bye Bye Love,&quot; with a Bo Diddley beat that helped lift the song to number two in 1957. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Bye Bye Love\n02.I Wonder If I Care As Much\n03.Wake Up Little Susie\n04.This Little Girl Of Mine\n05.Brand New Heartache\n06.Hey Doll Baby\n07.All I Have To Do Is Dream\n08.Claudette\n09.Bird Dog\n10.Devoted To You\n11.Problems\n12.Love Of My Life\n13.I'm Here To Get My Baby Out Of Jail\n14.Take A Message To Mary\n15.Poor Jenny\n16.('Til) I Kissed You\n17.Let It Be Me\n18.Since You Broke My Heart\n19.Like Strangers\n20.When Will I Be Loved?\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:924c861e43e6d3c4fa9bc897a7c67358cba3547c","amp;dn":"Everly+Brothers+-+20+Cadence+Greatest+Hits+%281990%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"924c861e43e6d3c4fa9bc897a7c67358cba3547c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,76,134,30,67,230,211,196,250,155,200,151,167,198,115,88,203,163,84,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
