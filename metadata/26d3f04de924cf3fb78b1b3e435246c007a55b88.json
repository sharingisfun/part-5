The term also refers to the associated dance styles and fashions that emanated from the Twisted Wheel club in Manchester and spread to other dancehalls and nightclubs, such as the Golden Torch (in Stoke-upon-Trent), the Highland Rooms at the Blackpool Mecca and the Wigan Casino. Northern soul dancing was usually athletic, resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, and backdrops, the northern soul dancing style was inspired by the stage performances of visiting American soul acts.\nUnquestionably the World\\\\\\&amp;#039;s most famous Soul Club, not only nationally, but internationally as well. The influential American music magazine \\\\\\&amp;#039;Billboard\\\\\\&amp;#039; officially voted it \\\\\\&amp;#039;The Best Disco in the World\\\\\\&amp;#039; ahead of New York\\\\\\&amp;#039;s \\\\\\&amp;#039;Studio 54\\\\\\&amp;#039; in 1978. Whist appreciating the honour bestowed upon it most of the Casino regulars hated the term \\\\\\&amp;#039;Disco\\\\\\&amp;#039;. \\\\\\&amp;#039;Disco\\\\\\&amp;#039; brings to mind expensive cocktails and sharp men in slick suits trying to \\\\\\&amp;#039;pull\\\\\\&amp;#039; elegant women. None of this at the Casino! It served no alcohol whatsoever, it was too hot and sweaty to wear a suit, although we did and changed into our dancing clothes ready to do the business, and for the most part men and women ignored each other, unless of course they were discussing the latest soul releases. Forgiving our American Friends their ignorance the Casino was never a Disco, it was a Soul Club.\nDespite not having the same financial baxkers as the Blackpool Mecca did the Casino was still remarkably successful in unearthing unknown soul obscurities. It also boasted a big turnaround of live American acts. This was not the main reason for its legendary reputation however as both the Torch and the Twisted Wheel brought them over on a more regular basis. It was much more to do with the venue itself which had begun life as a large post-Victorian theatre before turning into a Snooker hall. By the time it became a Soul Club it was more than a little dilapidated but was perfect for the soul lover\\\\\\&amp;#039;s tastes. It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s main room held a massive wooden dancefloor surrounded by a large balcony. There was plenty of seating downstairs where people could sit and replenish their bodily fluids purely on soft drinks. Just like the Mecca it also had a secondary room known as \\\\\\&amp;#039;Mr M\\\\\\&amp;#039;s\\\\\\&amp;#039; which opened a couple of hours after the doors had opened. This room was purely oldies and concentrated exclusively on sixties Soul. The Casino had a predominantly R&amp;B policy making it rare to hear anything with a funky influence, although a few did find their way to the turntables, nor did it concentrate exclusively on obscurities as normal issues were well integrated into the Casino playlists. This may well have been a significant factor in the Casino\\\\\\&amp;#039;s success as any new member would almost certainly hear something with which they were familiar.\nUnfortunately the Casino\\\\\\&amp;#039;s success may well have contributed to its demise because as its reputation grew so did its commercial viability. At one stage it could boast a membership of over 100,000 people. Record companies started exploiting Northern Soul favourites by pushing them into the pop charts. White Bands such as Soft Cell started making poor cover versions of the Casino\\\\\\&amp;#039;s discoveries in a bid for commercial success. Silly dancers appeared on Top Of The Pops calling themselves \\\\\\&amp;#039;Wigan\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Chosen Few\\\\\\&amp;#039; but the main reason was that DJ\\\\\\&amp;#039;s were seduced by the hype and promises of untold riches. The authentic Soul records of the sixties had SUPPOSEDLY all been \\\\\\&amp;#039;DISCOVERED\\\\\\&amp;#039; so in an attempt to find new sounds they started introducing soul influenced pop songs and tried to pass them off as the genuine article. The true Soul Fans moved on as the Casino became increasingly populated by curious trendies all wanting to jump on the Northern Soul bandwagon. As well as the introduction of crap music their was the newcommers who only came along to take speed and pretend to be a part of the scene.\nOn December 6th. 1981 its doors closed for the last time as the local Council shut it down due to the bad reputation the club was getting from the regular drug busts and the local thugs trying to fight the soulies at the local hot dog van apart from the criminal element surrounding the amphetemines.. A few months later in a freak accident the Casino caught fire and was razed to the ground. Despite its later loss of direction the Casino will forever remain a treasured memory for those who were fortunate enough to attend. With Russ Winstanley reaching into his record box after playing the \\\\\\&amp;#039;3 before 8\\\\\\&amp;#039; three times and pulling out Frank Wilson that was the last ever sound played at Wigan ( Who would of guessed its now the worlds most expensive record and last exchanged hands for ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£15,000! Supposedly ther has been 6 more coppies surface but only rumours )\nI have been on the Northern Soul scene for many years as Promoter, Dj and total freak. And thought it was about time to put a bit back into the scene that causes me to have so many memories and so many sleepless nights.\nThis torrent is compiled by me and ripped by myself and other friends on the scene ( Thanks alot guys ~ Keep the Faith ). Although it was bloody hard putting these together I cant begin to tell ya the fun I had and the memories it brought back playing some of these for the first time in a while. I was asked by many to make these torrents a smaller size and to put them into cattegories so this I have painstakingly done, and made several of the very best Northern Soul compilations money can buy ( If you can find them that is ).\nAll that is left for me to say is ENJOY and to please seed for a while as we need to get these rarities out there\n. \nunionjack ( Soul ~ As Deep As You Like and Some )\n\nLaine Hill\t    Time Marches On\t           2:30\nLarry Santos\t    You got Me where \t          2:49\nLarry Clinton\tShes wanted\t        2:46\nLarry Williams/Watson  Too late\t        2:25\nLaura Greene\tMoonlight,music and you 2:32\nLen Jewell\tBettin On Love\t        2:47\nLittle Jimmy Scott\tIt rained 40 days\t 2:02\nLittle Ritchie\tJust another heartache    2:44\nLorraine Chandler\tI cant change\t2:24\nLou Johnson\tUnsatisfied\t2:35\nLou Ragland\tI travel alone\t2:33\nLouis Lewis\tOoow wee let it be me     2:58\nLove Bandit\tKenya Collins\t2:42\nLove you baby\tEddie Parker\t2:50\nMadeleine Bell\tPicure me gone\t2:48\nMajor Lance \tYou dont want me no mo 2:14\nMarsha Gee\tBaby I need you\t2:30\nMartha Starr\tLove is the only solution\t2:46\nMarvin Smith\tHave More time\t2:14\nMary Sexton\tTake my heart\t2:04\nMasqueraders\tI got the power\t2:22\nMaurice Williams\tBeing without you\t2:29\nMel Britt\tShell come running back\t2:16\nMilton Wright\tI belong to you\t2:44\nModern Redcaps\tNever too young\t2:21\nMoments\tI got the need\t2:43\nMontclaires\tHung up on your love\t2:44\nMorris Chectnut\tToo darn soulful\t2:29\nMoses Dillard \tIll pay the price\t2:27\nMr creater\t\t2:39\nN.F.Porter\tKeep on keeping on\t2:52\nNancy Wilson\tThe end of our love\t2:22\nGloria Jones\tTainted Love\t2:13\nNosmo King\tGoodbye nothing to say\t2:49\nOllie Jackson\tThe day my heart stood   2:11\nParamounts\tThe girls with the big\t2:11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nPaul Anka\tI cant help lovin you\t2:37\nPointer Sisters\tSend him back\t2:38\nPookie Hudson\tThis gets to me\t2:02\nPrince Philip Mitchell\tIm so happy\t4:35\nR Dean Taylor\tTheres a ghost in my \t2:23\n\thouse\nRay Polard\tThe Drifter\t2:58\nReflections\tJust like romeo n juliet\t2:23\nReperata &amp;
