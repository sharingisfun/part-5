Grifter was his troubleshooter and Agent Wax was one of his first associates. The stories added a motley group to this proactive organisation including the power broker C.C. Rendozzo and her organization, Agent Orange, and Grifter's unlikely pupil Edwin Dolby, one of HALO's accountants. The series ended with a thunderous finale where Zealot destroyed the Coda chapter she created on Earth. The whole series was written by Joe Casey and most of it was illustrated by Dustin Nguyen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2a0c88ca4f1dbd311a9fcb2bba560d239b3634","amp;dn":"WILDCATS+VERSION+3.0+%282002-2004%29+01-24+Complete+%28DC+Wildstorm%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2a0c88ca4f1dbd311a9fcb2bba560d239b3634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,42,12,136,202,79,29,189,49,26,159,203,43,186,86,13,35,155,54,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
