Amid the celebrations, word spreads that Ragna the Bloodedge, an SS-class rebel with the highest ever bounty on his head, has appeared in the 13th Hierarchical City of Kagutsuchi. The apparent aim of Ragna or the &quot;Grim Reaper&quot; is the destruction of the system controlling the world. To collect the bounty, a motley array of unrivaled fighters converge on Kagutsuchi.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11bed1b2d827585fb56c7def06bf77bddc710bc2","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+BlazBlue+-+Alter+Memory+1-12+%5B720p%5D%5BMKV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11bed1b2d827585fb56c7def06bf77bddc710bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,190,209,178,216,39,88,95,181,108,125,239,6,191,119,189,220,113,11,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
