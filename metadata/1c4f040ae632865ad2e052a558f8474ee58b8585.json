This group included ex-Ellington clarinetist Barney Bigard, ex-Jimmie Lunceford swing-to-bop trombonist Trummy Young, bassist Mort Herbert, and drummer Danny Barcelona. A second session took place during the afternoon of the following day. \nThe music resulting from Thiele's inspired experiment is outstanding and utterly essential. That means everybody ought to hear this album at least once, and many will want to hear it again and again all the way through, for this is one of the most intriguing confluences in all of recorded jazz.\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4f040ae632865ad2e052a558f8474ee58b8585","amp;dn":"L.+Armstrong+%26amp%3B+D.+Ellington+-+The+Great+Summit%3A+The+Masters+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4f040ae632865ad2e052a558f8474ee58b8585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,79,4,10,230,50,134,90,210,224,82,165,88,248,71,78,229,139,133,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
