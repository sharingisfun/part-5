No Freedom (Benny Bennasi Remix)\n\n\n\nDido, one of the world's best-selling female recording artists of all time with over 29 million albums sold, returns with her strongest album yet entitled GIRL WHO GOT AWAY\n\nWorking once again with her brother Rollo Armstrong, who produced the majority of the album, Dido collaborated with a &quot;who's who&quot; of hit makers including Brian Eno, Jeff Bhasker, Rick Nowels and Greg Kurstin to create an album of finely, self-penned songs and soul-baring pop with electro, folk, hip hop, ambient and dance infusions.\n\nThe album GIRL WHO GOT AWAY is a captivating collection of well-crafted songs and stunning production: from the euphoric &quot;Go Dreaming&quot;, to the barbed wit of End of Night, the folky &quot;Sitting On The Roof Of The World&quot; to the dance-y-yet-dark &quot;Blackbir&quot; to the album's title track which Dido shares: &quot;It's one of my favorite songs on the record&quot;, she says. &quot;...but I guess it also sums up the last few years for me. Taking a step back from it all and going off to have the whole happy adventure of starting a family and making an album that I really am so proud of. And now I just can't wait for people to hear it&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dc868aed2df8522e9c60a0228484a898d87890f","amp;dn":"Dido+-+Girl+Who+Got+Away+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%282013%29+iTunes+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dc868aed2df8522e9c60a0228484a898d87890f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,200,104,174,210,223,133,34,233,198,10,2,40,72,74,137,141,135,137,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
