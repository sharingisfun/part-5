This group of Soul &amp; Latino brothers, made music just as good as any others. I still listen to them today. Here is my collection of Mandrill&amp;#039;s music. It took a while to find them all, but other than thier recenty Cd&amp;#039;s, this collection I&amp;#039;m proud to say is complete. If you&amp;#039;re into 70&amp;#039;s funk, then check out Mandrill. They are best know for &quot;Symphonic Revolution &amp; Central Park&quot; One of my favorite is &quot; I Refuse To Smile&quot; from Mandrill Is. Let me know if you dig.
