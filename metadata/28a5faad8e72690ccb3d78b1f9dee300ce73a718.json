He is also a published writer, a political activist and has written and directed a play. When he first came to prominence in 1986, he was viewed as a savior of country music (along with the likes of Randy Travis and Dwight Yoakam) and hailed by some as the &quot;new Bruce Springsteen&quot;[citation needed]. In the later part of his career, after troubles with the law, drug addiction and his uncompromising viewpoints, he has become known as &quot;the hardcore troubadour&quot;.\n\n\nIn 1975, Earle moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he met and worked with Guy Clark and his wife Susanna. Clark was active in Earle being employed as a songwriter by the Sunbury Dunbar publishing division of RCA. Earle did backing vocals on &quot;Desperados Waiting for a Train&quot; (together with Emmylou Harris) on Clark's first album Old No. 1.\n\nDespite his early success as a songwriter, it was not until 1981 that Earle achieved a top-ten cut with &quot;When You Fall in Love&quot;, which was recorded by Johnny Lee.\n\nEarle's early work as a recorded performer was in the rockabilly style, and can be heard on the Early Years album. He had to wait until 1986, though, before his first proper album, Guitar Town, was released. It was a critical success and was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The follow-up albums Exit 0 and the certified-gold Copperhead Road built on this success.\n\nEarle had been a drug user since an early age and was addicted to heroin for many years. By the time of his 1990 album The Hard Way, it started to become clear that the drugs were seriously affecting him. In 1993, his drug problems resulted in him effectively stopping performing and recording for two years, a period he refers to as his &quot;vacation in the ghetto&quot;. He eventually ended up in jail on drug and firearms charges. Kicking the drug habit while in jail, Earle came out a new man and released two albums within 18 months of his release in late 1994. His comeback album, the bluegrass Train A Comin', was nominated for the Best Contemporary Folk Album Grammy Award in 1996.\n\nEarle's &quot;second, post-jail musical career&quot; has been noticeably more musically diverse than his early work. Since setting up his own record label, he has been able to follow his own artistic direction, rather than being constrained by the Nashville country pop-rock sound. This has led to experimentation with a range of styles from country and bluegrass music to folk and hard rock music. He has maintained a strict work ethic. Several albums have been released since, as well as a book of haiku and a collection of short stories called Doghouse Roses. He also wrote and directed a play about the death penalty. Earle also tours often, playing over 200 shows per year. His concerts tend to be either solo acoustic shows or ensemble affairs with one of his two backing bands, the Dukes or the Bluegrass Dukes.\n\nEarle is the subject of a documentary film entitled Just an American Boy, directed by Amos Poe, which explores his political views as well as his music. In 2005, he caused consternation among his fans by allowing the song &quot;The Revolution Starts Now&quot; to be used by General Motors in a TV advertisement for pick-up trucks.[1]\n\nEarle is also the subject of the biography, Steve Earle: Fearless Heart, Outlaw Poet, by the noted New York-based music writer David McGee.\n\nIn September 2007, Earle released his twelfth studio album, Washington Square Serenade[2], on New West Records. Earle recorded the album after relocating to New York City, and it was his first attempt at using digital audio workstation ProTools, as opposed to traditional analog recording techniques.[3] The disc features wife Allison Moorer on &quot;Days Aren't Long Enough&quot;.\n\nIn 2008, Earle produced Joan Baez's album Day After Tomorrow.[4] In the winter, he toured Europe and North America in support of Washington Square Serenade, performing half the set solo and the other half with a DJ.[3]\n\nOn May 12, 2009, Earle released a tribute album, Townes, on New West Records. The album contains 15 songs written by his late friend and musical mentor Townes Van Zandt. Guest artists appearing on the album include Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, Earle's wife Allison Moorer, and his son Justin Townes Earle.\n\nEarle portrayed a recovered drug addict named Walon in several episodes of the HBO television series The Wire.[6] He appears first in season one where he addresses a 12-step-type meeting with an account of how he lost everything to addiction: &quot;I pawned my bike, my pickup truck, a National Steel guitar, a stamp collection that my grandpa left me; lost a good wife, a bad girlfriend, and the respect of anyone who ever lent me money&quot;. His story affects Bubbles and appears to spur him towards recovery. After season one, Walon does not return until Bubbles hits rock-bottom hard in the season four finale. Picking up the thread, he then appears throughout season five as sponsor, as Bubbles attempts to overcome his heroin addiction and its consequences.\n\nEarle's song &quot;I Feel Alright&quot; is used in a montage to close out season two. He also performs the opening theme of the fifth season, performing &quot;Way Down in the Hole&quot;, a song written by Tom Waits.\n\nEarle's radio show on Air America began in August 2004 and last aired on June 10, 2007, and that was a rebroadcast of a past episode.[7] Shortly thereafter, he started DJing on a show on Sirius Satellite Radio called Hardcore Troubadour on their Outlaw Country channel.\n\nSince early in his career, Earle has been involved in a number of political causes. In his first public performances, Earle was unable to play in bars due to his age and took to playing in coffeehouses alongside anti-Vietnam War campaigners. These experiences had a strong effect on him, prompting his opposition to the war in Iraq.\n\nEarle's mother took part in anti-death penalty vigils, a cause that has been taken up by Earle. He has worked to abolish the death penalty and has recorded several songs about this cause, including &quot;Billy Austin&quot;, &quot;Over Yonder (Jonathan's Song)&quot; and &quot;Ellis Unit One&quot; for the 1995 film Dead Man Walking. Ellis Unit, located in Huntsville, Texas, previously housed the Texas male death row convicts, until it was moved to Polunsky Unit near Livingston, Texas. He is also a regular participant in the &quot;Concerts for a Landmine Free World&quot;, benefiting the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation.\n\nIn recent years his music has been increasingly political. His 2002 album, Jerusalem, was largely inspired by the U.S.-led War on Terrorism. This album featured &quot;John Walker's Blues&quot;, which was about the captured American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh. The song provoked widespread outrage; many accused Earle of sympathizing with terrorists since the song was written from Lindh's perspective. Earle responded that he was simply empathizing with Lindh and in no way set out to glorify terrorism. The controversy raised Earle's profile in the media, but did not seem to damage his record sales.[citation needed]\n\nHis 2004 album, The Revolution Starts Now, which features several songs relating to the war in Iraq, was deliberately released to coincide with the run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, with the aim of encouraging votes for John Kerry[citation needed]. The song &quot;The Revolution Starts Now&quot; was used in the promotion of Michael Moore's anti-war documentary film Fahrenheit 9/11 and appears on the album Songs and Artists That Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11, the songs for which were selected by Moore. The song also opened Earle's weekly Sunday-night show on Air America Radio. He appears in the 2008 political documentary Slacker Uprising.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTUDIO ALBUMS \n\n\n\n\n\nGuitar Town 1986\n\n\nGuitar Town is the debut album of country singer Steve Earle, released in 1986. In 2003, the album was ranked number 489 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2006, it ranked 27th on CMT's 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Guitar Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33\n2.\t&quot;Goodbye's All We've Got Left&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n3.\t&quot;Hillbilly Highway&quot; (Earle, Jimbeau Hinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n4.\t&quot;Good Ol' Boy (Gettin' Tough)&quot; (Richard Bennett, Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n5.\t&quot;My Old Friend the Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n6.\t&quot;Someday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n7.\t&quot;Think It Over&quot; (Bennett, Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:13\n8.\t&quot;Fearless Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n9.\t&quot;Little Rock &amp; Roller&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n10.\t&quot;Down the Road&quot; (Tony Brown, Earle, Hinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit 0 1987\n\n\nExit 0 is the second album of country singer Steve Earle, credited to Steve Earle &amp; The Dukes, his backing band of the time. The album is stylistically similar to his debut album Guitar Town and contains some of his best liked songs such as 'I Ain't Ever Satisfied'.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Nowhere Road&quot; (Earle, Reno Kling) - 2:27\n2.\t&quot;Sweet Little '66&quot; - 2:38\n3.\t&quot;No. 29&quot; - 3:30\n4.\t&quot;Angry Young Man&quot; (Earle, John Porter McMeans) - 4:24\n5.\t&quot;San Antonio Girl&quot; - 3:06\n6.\t&quot;The Rain Came Down&quot; (Earle, Michael Woody) - 4:11\n7.\t&quot;I Ain't Ever Satisfied&quot; - 4:00\n8.\t&quot;The Week of Living Dangerously&quot; - 4:26\n9.\t&quot;I Love You Too Much&quot; - 3:37\n10.\t&quot;It's All up to You&quot; (Earle, Harry Stinson) - 5:42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopperhead Road 1988\n\n\nCopperhead Road is an American country music/country rock album released in 1988 by Steve Earle. Often referred to as Earle's &quot;rock record&quot;, Earle himself calls it the world's first blend of heavy metal and bluegrass, while in their January 26, 1989 review of the album Rolling Stone suggested the style be known as &quot;power twang&quot;\n\n\nThe title song &quot;Copperhead Road&quot; tells of a Vietnam War veteran, scion of a rural moonshine bootlegging clan, who returns home to Johnson County, Tennessee (Copperhead road is an actual road near Mountain City, TN). The song also inspired a popular line dance timed to the beat of the song.\n\nThe songs on side one of the album reflect Earle's politics: the title track attacks the War on Drugs, and the song &quot;Snake Oil&quot; compares then president Ronald Reagan to a traveling con man and draws attention to his &quot;legacy of creative deceit&quot;[1]. &quot;Johnny Come Lately&quot; (performed with The Pogues[1]) compares the experience of US servicemen fighting in World War II with those in the Vietnam War, and contrasts the differing receptions they received on returning home. &quot;Back to the Wall&quot; is about poverty.\n\nUnlike some issues-oriented musicians, however, Earle does not limit himself to political material. The second side of the album consists of apolitical works: love songs (&quot;Even When I'm Blue&quot; for example) and a holiday offering (&quot;Nothing but a Child&quot;, performed here with Maria McKee])\n\nThe song &quot;Copperhead Road&quot; contains subtle references to &quot;The Ballad of Thunder Road&quot;, another song about moonshine running. The second verse talks about the sheriff informing the boy's mother of his dad's (implied) death while &quot;headin' down to Knoxville with the weekly load&quot; (in &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, the bootlegger ran off Kingston Pike outside Bearden, a community in Knoxville).\n\n\nIn declaring Copperhead Road Rock Album of the Week on October 21, 1988, The New York Times described it as &quot;...exactly half of a brilliant album, with five smart, ornery, memorable story-songs.&quot;[2]. With references to Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp and The Rolling Stones the paper applauded Earle for introducing country music's storytelling and three-chord structures to rockabilly and contemporary rock music. Side two, however, the Times dismissed as &quot;strictly average&quot; love songs and a &quot;hokey&quot; Christmas song.[2] Time Magazine, including it in the September 19, 1988 Critics' Choices, described it as a &quot;rock- inflected, country-based album&quot; that &quot;takes long chances with big themes... and does them proud&quot;[3].\n\nIt was a month into the new year before Rolling Stone finally published their review of Copperhead Road, but for Earle it must have been worth the wait. On January 26, 1989, Rob Tannenbaum wrote that the album &quot;begins murderously and ends sentimentally... split into two song cycles&quot;, and described the album's first side as being &quot;as powerful as any music made this year&quot;. Of side two he admits disappointment at conventional love songs, saying Earle &quot;has already examined this terrain and done a better job of it.&quot; Nonetheless, a review that compares Earle to Randy Newman, Bruce Springsteen, and Waylon Jennings among others concludes with Rolling Stone's designating Earle an &quot;important artist&quot; and finding Copperhead Road worthy of four stars [1].\n\nAirplay on rock radio stations drove the title track into Billboard Magazine's Album Rock Top Ten chart, and that in turn helped Copperhead Road on Billboard's Album Chart, where it peaked at number 56 and gave Earle his highest charting album to date.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Copperhead Road&quot; - 4:30\n2.\t&quot;Snake Oil&quot; - 3:31\n3.\t&quot;Back to the Wall&quot; - 5:29\n4.\t&quot;The Devil's Right Hand&quot; - 3:04\n5.\t&quot;Johnny Come Lately&quot; - 4:11\n6.\t&quot;Even When I'm Blue&quot; - 4:14\n7.\t&quot;You Belong to Me&quot; - 4:25\n8.\t&quot;Waiting on You&quot; (Earle, Richard Bennett) - 5:10\n9.\t&quot;Once You Love&quot; (Earle, Larry Crane) - 4:39\n10.\t&quot;Nothing but a Child&quot; - 4:26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hard Way 1990\n\n\nThe Hard Way is a studio album by Steve Earle and The Dukes.

Down The Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether at the Bluebird CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© 2001\n\n\nTogether at the Bluebird CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is a live recording of an &quot;in-the-round&quot; concert by three critically acclaimed Texas-born singer-songwriters, Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt, and Guy Clark. Each of the three songwriters alternate between solo performances. The album is unique for the camaraderie between the three artists whose personal lives and musical careers are very much intertwined.\n\nThe event was organized by Susanna Clark (Guy Clark's wife) as a benefit for the Interfaith Dental Clinic, an organization that works to &quot;restore, protect, and improve the oral health of uninsured, low-income, working people and their children in the greater Nashville area.&quot;[11] In the liner notes Clark indicates, &quot;When I asked Guy, Townes, and Steve to help me raise money for the Interfaith Dental Clinic, I had no idea what a stir it would cause.&quot;[12] The clinic is mentioned the program by Townes Van Zandt who apparently had been a recipient of their services. Van Zandt tells a story of an incident in which he lost a gold tooth while shooting dice.\n\nThe recording took place on September 3, 1995 at Nashville's nationally renown venue for songwriters, The Bluebird CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. Owner and manager, Amy Kurland, described the show as &quot;one of the best&quot; in 19 years.[12][13]\n\nThe concert took place just 15 months before Townes Van Zandt's death. As was true 22 years earlier in his Live at the Old Quarter, Van Zandt's humor, wedged between some very sad songs is a prominent feature. The stripped down versions of Earle's songs are also unique. Earle's own live performances and albums rarely offer the listener so many chances to hear his music without the backing of a full band. Guy Clark spends the least time talking between songs, allowing his songs to tell their own stories. Occasionally the artists interact, like when Clark joins Earle on the &quot;Mercenary Song&quot;.\n\nA female vocalist not credited in the liner notes, but apparently Emmylou Harris adds a harmony vocal to Guy Clark's &quot;Immigrant Eyes&quot; and on Steve Earle's &quot;Copperhead Road&quot;.[2] Earle names Mark Stuart as the additional guitarist on &quot;Copperhead Road&quot;.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Baby Took a Limo to Memphis&quot; (Guy Clark) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n2.\t&quot;My Old Friend the Blues&quot; (Steve Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03\n3.\tTownes: Introduction to &quot;Katie Belle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:44\n4.\t&quot;Katie Belle&quot; (Townes Van Zandt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n5.\t&quot;The Cape&quot; (Guy Clark,Susanna Clark, Jim Jonosky) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n6.\tSteve: Introduction to &quot;Valentine's Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:03\n7.\t&quot;Valentine's Day&quot; (Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n8.\t&quot;Ain't Leavin' Your Love&quot; (Van Zandt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n9.\t&quot;Randall Knife&quot; (Clark) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46 (a reference to Randall Made Knives)\n10.\t&quot;Tom Ames' Prayer&quot; (Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n11.\tTownes: The Interfaith Dental Clinic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n12.\t&quot;A Song For&quot; (Van Zandt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n13.\t&quot;Dublin Blues&quot; (Clark) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n14.\t&quot;I Ain't Ever Satisfied&quot; (Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n15.\t&quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot; (Van Zandt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22\n16.\t&quot;Immigrant Eyes&quot; (Clark, Roger Murrah) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n17.\tSteve: Sirocco's Pizza ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:42\n18.\t&quot;Mercenary Song&quot; (Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n19.\t&quot;Tecumseh Valley&quot; (Van Zandt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n20.\t&quot;Copperhead Road&quot; (Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust an American Boy 2003\n\n\nJust An American Boy is a live album by Steve Earle.
