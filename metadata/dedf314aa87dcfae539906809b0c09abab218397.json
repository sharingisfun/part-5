And what does he have to do with the judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister. Job status? Former attorney. Current residence? The Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland.\n\nOn paper, MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s situation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking too good these days, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an ace up his sleeve. He knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and he knows why. The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body was found in his remote lakeside cabin. There was no forced entry, no struggle, just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied.\n\nWhat was in the safe? The FBI would love to know. And Malcolm Bannister would love to tell them. But everything has a priceÃ¢â‚¬â€especially information as explosive as the sequence of events that led to Judge FawcettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. And the Racketeer wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t born yesterday . . .\n\nNothing is as it seems and everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair game in this wickedly clever new novel from John Grisham, the undisputed master of the legal thriller.\n\nThe New York Times\nIn its early stages [The Racketeer] does follow the familiar Grisham template, in which a lawyer finds himself unexpectedly in legal trouble. But then it breaks out into the exhilarating tale of how Mal, a disbarred attorney, now a savvy, self-taught legal scholar, leads his pursuers on a long, winding chaseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦this is not a story about a triumph or a miscarriage of courtroom justice. It's the more devious, surprising story of a smart man who gets even smarter once he spends five years honing his skills as a jailhouse lawyerÃ¢â‚¬â€and then expertly concocts an ingenious revenge schemeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Mr. Grisham writes with rekindled vigor here. Perhaps that's because he hasn't mired this book in excessive researchÃ¢â‚¬Â¦He has simplyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦gone back to what he does best, storytelling rather than crusading.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Janet Maslin\n\nProduct Details\nISBN-13: 9780385535144\nPublisher: Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group\nPublication date: 10/23/2012\nPages: 352","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dedf314aa87dcfae539906809b0c09abab218397","amp;dn":"John+Grisham+-+The+Racketeer+%5B64%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dedf314aa87dcfae539906809b0c09abab218397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,223,49,74,168,125,207,174,83,153,6,128,155,12,9,171,171,33,131,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
