Why the Dragons of Bel'kwinith made the Road--or who they are--no one knows. But the Road has always been there and for those who know how to find it, it always will be!\n\nThis is one of my favorites. If you can find the book buy it.\n\nGeorgia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01071f01ce75e9b12b98d4c9dd51a1e74749d2bc","amp;dn":"Roger+Zelazny+-+Roadmarks+1979+%5BMobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01071f01ce75e9b12b98d4c9dd51a1e74749d2bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,7,31,1,206,117,233,177,43,152,212,201,221,81,161,231,71,73,210,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
