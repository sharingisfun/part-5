The key purpose of this book is to provide undergraduate and graduate students with a sound conceptual understanding of the role that management science plays in the decision-making process. AN INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENT SCIENCE is applications-oriented and continues to use the problem-scenario approach that is a hallmark of every edition of the text, in which a problem is described in conjunction with the management science model that's introduced. The model is then solved to generate a solution and recommendation to management.Kindle textbooks are functionally equivalent to the print textbook.\n\nAbout the Author\nDavid R.
