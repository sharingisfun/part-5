Long before it is a country song, or a sad song, anything she sings is an Emmylou Harris song.\nYet at the same time, curiously, the Alabama native is a singer whose best moments come in partnership. And on Old Yellow Moon, in that hokiest of country traditions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the boy/girl duet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an old alliance triumphs with charm.\nAs HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ second-most famous singing partner, Rodney Crowell has sometimes suffered by unfair comparison with the man who came before him: Gram Parsons.\nParsons reframed country music through the lens of the 60s counter-culture Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and his legacy is most effectively realised on a wonderful tribute album, Return of the Grievous Angel, which may be HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (as co-producer) own finest achievement.\nBut Crowell is a different thing, a songwriting craftsman with a naturally emotive tenor that beautifully complements that famous soprano.\nNearly 40 years after he joined forces with Emmylou in her 1970s Hot Band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and supported by impeccable contributions from other distinguished veterans of that era, like James Burton, Bill Payne and Hank DeVito Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Crowell drives the partnership through a handful of songs that are as sassy and spry as the best of their early years.\nAnd if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no getting away from the roots pairing that has outstripped the rest in the 21st century, it should be said that the stomping Harris/Crowell take on Kris KristoffersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chase the Feeling bears comparison with anything from Robert Plant and Alison Krauss.\nStill, much of Old Yellow Moon is unashamedly sentimental. Its eighth track, CrowellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bluebird Wine, was the song that introduced the pairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first collaboration in 1975 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and producer Brian Ahern was there on the day, too.\nPerhaps someone less familiar at the helm might have muttered a stern word when these old friends began to get maudlin on weepies like Matraca BergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Back When We Were Beautiful. But you know what nostalgic reunions are like.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ae32698fcac503f0d20339e5197a39e578e599e","amp;dn":"Emmylou+Harris+and+Rodney+Crowell+-+Old+Yellow+Moon+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Cl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ae32698fcac503f0d20339e5197a39e578e599e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,227,38,152,252,172,80,63,13,32,51,158,81,151,163,158,87,142,89,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
