Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker and Ethan Becker\nEnglish | 12-06-2001 | ISBN-10: 074321501X | PDF | 132 Pages | 49,2 Mb\n\nSixty years after Irma Rombauer advised new cooks to &quot;Stand facing the stove,&quot; America's love affair with Joy of Cooking continues unabated. And why not? Joy in hand, tens of millions of people -- from novices to professionals -- have learned to do everything from make a meat loaf to clean a squid to frost a wedding cake. For decades, Joy of Cooking has taught America how to cook, serving as the standard against which all other cookbooks are judged.\n\nAll About Salads &amp; Dressings upholds that standard. While keeping the conversational and instructional manner of the flagship book, All About Salads &amp; Dressings is organized by salad type including green; vegetable and savory fruit; bean and grain; fish and shellfish; meat and poultry -- with such delicious classics and exciting innovations as Caesar Salad; Thai Beef Salad; Grilled Swordfish, Tangerine, and J?cama Salad; Tomato and Mozzarella Salad; Hot Apple Slaw; and Three-Bean Salad. And don't forget the dressings: everything from Basic Vinaigrette to creamy Green Goddess Dressing is covered. With a full primer on varieties of lettuce and suggestions for garnishing, All About Salads &amp; Dressings illustrates how much more there is to salad than just lettuce.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a11d9e3cf452f33b9df9d0d879a0198e8b0ba09","amp;dn":"Joy+of+Cooking+-+All+About+Salads+%26amp%3B+Dressings.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a11d9e3cf452f33b9df9d0d879a0198e8b0ba09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,17,217,227,207,69,47,51,185,223,157,13,135,154,1,152,232,176,186,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
