He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 for his work with the Temptations. Fellow Motown recording artist Marvin Gaye once said admiringly of Ruffin that, &quot;I heard in [his voice] a strength my own voice lacked.&quot;\n \nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e4a481d6ca58bfb6dfd1ab4449cffd58e233b8","amp;dn":"David+Ruffin-9+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e4a481d6ca58bfb6dfd1ab4449cffd58e233b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,228,164,129,214,202,88,191,182,223,209,171,68,73,207,253,88,226,51,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
