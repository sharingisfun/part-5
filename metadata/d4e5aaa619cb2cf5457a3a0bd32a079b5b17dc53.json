Medea sees Jason and swoons, then enlists her brother's aid to take the fleece. She then murders her brother and becomes Jason's lover. Back in Greece, the king keeps the throne, the fleece has no power, and Medea lives an exile's life, respected but feared, abandoned by Jason. When she learns he's to marry the king's daughter, Medea tames her emotions and sends gifts via her sons; then, loss overwhelms her and she unleashes a fire storm on the king, the bride, and Jason.\n(by Imdb)\n\nLang: It / Eng subs\n\nOne of the great movies by the italian maestro Pier Paolo Pasolini with Maria Callas starring!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e5aaa619cb2cf5457a3a0bd32a079b5b17dc53","amp;dn":"Medea+%28Pasolini+1969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e5aaa619cb2cf5457a3a0bd32a079b5b17dc53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,229,170,166,25,203,44,245,69,122,58,11,211,42,7,155,91,23,220,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
