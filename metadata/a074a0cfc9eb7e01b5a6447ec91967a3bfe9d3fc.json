Whereas that album featured one lengthy, continuous composition (split on two sides of vinyl, of course), A Passion Play featured separate songs, though the original LP did not identify them. Part I occupied Side One of the LP, with Part II on Side Two. The same line-up as Thick as a Brick played on its follow-up Ian AndersonÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\non flute, acoustic guitar and saxophone, Martin Barre on guitar, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond on bass, Barriemore Barlow on drums and John Evans on keyboards.\n\nThe quintet began work at ChÃƒÂ¢teau dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢HÃƒÂ©rouville. The studio, located near Paris, was the Honky ChÃƒÂ¢teau of Elton John fame, and was also utilized by artists from Cat Stevens to Pink Floyd. Yet the band found that it was not the ideal setting to bring their new album to life. Despite recording roughly an hour of music, the band was dissatisfied with both the studioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technology and its living accommodations. The group returned home to the U.K. where work began on an all-new set of songs and recordings.\n\nRecorded in a whirlwind of activity before the band was set to begin a new tour, A Passion Play was composed (primarily by Ian Anderson) to explore the notion that choices might still be faced in the afterlife. Taking the form of a four-act play, it began with the character of Ronnie PilgrimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death and funeral (which he attended in spectral form) and followed him through the afterlife, to Heaven, Hell and beyond. Par for the Tull course, it combined poetry and rock, and melded rock, jazz, and folk sensibilities into an intricate whole. Though it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t meet with critical acclaim at the time, the prog-rock opus followed Thick as a Brick to the top of the U.S. charts upon its release in July 1973.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a074a0cfc9eb7e01b5a6447ec91967a3bfe9d3fc","amp;dn":"Jethro+Tull+-+A+Passion+Play+An+Extended+Performance+%5B40th+Anniv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a074a0cfc9eb7e01b5a6447ec91967a3bfe9d3fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,116,160,207,201,235,126,1,181,166,68,126,201,25,103,163,191,233,211,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
