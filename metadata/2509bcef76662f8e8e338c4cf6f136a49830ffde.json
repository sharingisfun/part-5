The reader is guided through controversies with an accessible, yet sophisticated approach by the author team of four international lawyers, with experience both of teaching the subject, and as negotiators at the foundation of the International Criminal Court and the Rome conference. It is an invaluable introduction for all students of international criminal law and international relations, and now covers developments in the ICC, victims' rights, and alternatives to international criminal justice, as well as including extended coverage of terrorism. Short, well chosen excerpts allow students to familiarise themselves with primary material from a wide range of sources. An extensive package of online resources is also available.\n\nPaperback: 685 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (June 28, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521135818\nISBN-13: 978-0521135818\nfiletype: pdf \n\n\n\n\nTags: international, law, system, order, political science, politics, power, machtpolitik, power politics, hedging, game theory, leverage, multipolar, world, international relations, security studies, westphalian, conflict studies, state, nation, country, human rights, weber, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2509bcef76662f8e8e338c4cf6f136a49830ffde","amp;dn":"An+introduction+to+international+criminal+law+and+procedure+%5Bbla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2509bcef76662f8e8e338c4cf6f136a49830ffde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,9,188,239,118,102,47,142,142,51,140,76,246,241,54,164,152,48,255,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
