Start creating manufacturing-ready parts and assemblies, as well as detailed drawings and bills of materials. In this course, author Gabriel Corbett shows how to create 2D sketches that will become the basis for your 3D models. You'll use the Extrude and Revolve tools to turn 2D sketches into 3D parts, then create more complex geometry with sweep and lofts. Then learn how to use the cut features to remove material and shape parts, and use mirroring, patterning, and scaling to modify parts. Next, you'll combine parts into movable assemblies and subassemblies. Finally, you'll create accurately annotated drawings, complete with itemized bills of materials that relate the final parts and assemblies to a manufacturer.\nTopics include:\n\n    Creating your first part\n    Starting a new sketch\n    Adding and removing relationships and dimensions\n    Sketching polygons\n    Creating offset geometry\n    Moving, copying, and rotating elements\n    Working with planes, axes, and the coordinate system\n    Using Revolve and Loft to create 3D objects\n    Trimming with the Revolve, Loft, and Sweep cuts\n    Creating smooth and angled corners with fillets and chamfers\n    Designing with sketch blocks\n    Working with subassemblies\n    Creating threaded parts\n    Integrating Excel to manage design tables\n    Adding dimension notations to a drawing\n    Rendering an image of a part or assembly\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f196d99780894aa82f0150b6616486004a909ba0","amp;dn":"Lynda-+SolidWorks+2014+Essential+Training+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f196d99780894aa82f0150b6616486004a909ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,150,217,151,128,137,74,168,47,1,80,182,97,100,134,0,74,144,155,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
