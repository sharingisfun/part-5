Beagle writes a shimmering prose-poetry, the voice of fairy tales and childhood:\n\n    The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea.\n\nThe unicorn discovers that she is the last unicorn in the world, and sets off to find the others. She meets Schmendrick the Magician--whose magic seldom works, and never as he intended--when he rescues her from Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, where only some of the mythical beasts displayed are illusions. They are joined by Molly Grue, who believes in legends despite her experiences with a Robin Hood wannabe and his unmerry men. Ahead wait King Haggard and his Red Bull, who banished unicorns from the land.\n\nThis is a book no fantasy reader should miss; Beagle argues brilliantly the need for magic in our lives and the folly of forgetting to dream. --Nona Vero","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a3afe459f09f7376e8b6ec6d273b7a1447243ab","amp;dn":"The+Last+Unicorn+by+Peter+S.+Beagle+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a3afe459f09f7376e8b6ec6d273b7a1447243ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,58,254,69,159,9,247,55,110,139,110,198,210,115,183,161,68,114,67,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
