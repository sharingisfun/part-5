In this cookbook, Chef Yoshio, a Tokyo native and trained French/Japanese fusion chef, introduces today's modern home cook to Okonomiyaki, one of the most popular comfort foods in Japan.

It uses a wide range of ingredients, including meat, seafood, vegetables, pasta, and more. When Chef Yoshio walks into an Okonomiyaki restaurant, he always gets the sense that his mother is there, helping to create the wonderful smells. For him, the taste of Okonomiyaki is the taste of home. Gathering his favorite recipes, Chef Yoshio shares his tips for three major regional styles of this comfort food in this cookbook-Hiroshima, Osaka, and Tokyo styles.
