Recognised for his precise, cold, forensic prose style, Nabokovian inventiveness, and for the dark humour of his generally arch narrators, Banville is considered one of the most imaginative literary novelists writing in the English language today.  Banville's stated ambition is to give his prose &quot;the kind of denseness and thickness that poetry has.&quot;\n\nBanville has received numerous awards in his career.  THE BOOK OF EVIDENCE was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the Guinness Peat Aviation award in 1989.  His fourteenth novel, THE SEA, won the Booker Prize in 2005.  In 2011, Banville was awarded the Franz Kafka Prize, while 2013 brought both the Irish PEN Award and the Austrian State Prize for European Literature.  He is considered a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2014, he has published 8 crime novels as Benjamin Black, six featuring an Irish pathologist based in Dublin.  The most recent (THE BLACK-EYED BLONDE) was published in March 2014.\n\n\nAll the following books are in ePUB format:\n\n\n     == by John Banville ==\n\n* ANCIENT LIGHT (Knopf, 2012)\n\n* ATHENA (Knopf, 1995)\n\n* BIRCHWOOD (Knopf, 1973)\n\n* THE BOOK OF EVIDENCE (Knopf, 1989)\n\n* DOCTOR COPERNICUS [Revolutions Trilogy I] (Picador, 1999)\n\n* ECLIPSE (Knopf, 2000)\n\n* GHOSTS (Knopf, 1993)\n\n* THE INFINITIES (Knopf, 2009)\n\n* KEPLER [Revolutions Trilogy II] (Vintage, 1993)\n\n* LONG LANKIN (Vintage, 1984)\n\n* MEFISTO (Picador, 1986)\n\n* THE NEWTON LETTER [Revolutions Trilogy III] (Picador, 1999)\n\n* NIGHTSPAWN (Gallery, 1993)\n\n* PRAGUE PICTURES: PORTRAIT OF A CITY (Bloomsbury, 2003)\n\n* THE SEA (Knopf, 2005)\n\n* SHROUD (Knopf, 2002)\n\n* THE UNTOUCHABLE (Knopf, 1997)\n\n\n     == Writing as &quot;Benjamin Black&quot; ==\n\n* THE BLACK-EYED BLONDE (Holt, 2014)\n\n* CHRISTINE FALLS (Holt, 2006)\n\n* A DEATH IN SUMMER (Holt, 2011)\n\n* ELEGY FOR APRIL (Holt, 2010)\n\n* HOLY ORDERS (Holt, 2013)\n\n* THE LEMUR (Holt, 2008)\n\n* THE SILVER SWAN (Holt, 2007)\n\n* VENGEANCE (Holt, 2012)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
