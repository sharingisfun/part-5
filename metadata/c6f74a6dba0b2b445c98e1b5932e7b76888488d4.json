With Beck's blistering blues riffs and Stewarts\ngravelly hobo voice, this is where the SuperGroups first started. Originally issued as two\nseperate albums, Truth and Beckola are brought together here on one CD, and this is a must\nfor any serious rock music fan. Admittedly, the sound lacks the dynamism and performance\nof, say Led Zepplin, but easily makes up for this in the musicianship, vocals and, not least,\nthe songs. The first album to be released, Truth, features some classic blues rock songs such\nas I ain't Superstitious and Rock My Plimsoul, whilst at the same time effortlessly slipping into\nthe more soulful Greensleeves and Ol' Man River. Sound dymanics and contrast are an\nimportant and oft overlooked ingrediant in the best of heavy rock. The arrangements, here,\nhowever, are full of light and dark corners and shade. This is a classic album which redefined\nrock music in the mid/late sixties. Beckola, on the other hand, goes one step further and\noffers something genuinely innovative and as such can be viewed as a landmark album from\n1969. Nicky Hopkins joined the group on keyboards and Rod Stewart was at his zenith as a\nblues singer and Jeff Beck was rapidly developing into a serious heavy blues guitarist.\nWhatever music Beck had made before was only leading up to this beathtaking album. The\naccent, as the sleeve notes explain, is on heavy music. And it doesn't come any heavier than\nthis. Plynth, Hangman's Knee and Rice Pudding are all intelligently arranged songs, avoiding\nthe crash bang wallop school of heavy rock, prefering instead an air of control and suspense.\nHistorically important as these two albums are, they are still as exciting and fresh as the day\nthey were released\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
