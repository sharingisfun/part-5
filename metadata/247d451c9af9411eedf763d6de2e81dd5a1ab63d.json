This is Krall's first full-length album of Christmas songs (not counting 1998's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas EP), and her first studio album with a big band. It is her ninth album overall. Billboard ranked album at number 14 on the magazine's Top Jazz Albums of the Decade.\n\nOn 2005's Christmas Songs, Diana Krall applies her sultry vocals and nuanced piano lines to a strong set of holiday classics. In addition to turning in a stirring performance of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; that would make Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole proud, Krall eases into a swaying version of &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; and a lush rendition of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.&quot; With its dynamic arrangements and pitch-perfect mix of pop and jazz, this album stands alongside other timeless Yuletide outings.\n\n\n\nReview by Jim Harrington:\nDiana Krall swings like nobody's business on what will likely be the best holiday jazz record of the season. What makes this album truly special is the fact that it holds up as both a Christmas album and as a jazz record. It's perfect for chestnut-roasting weather, but I could also see spinning it in mid-July just for kicks. It's not mere hyperbole to say that this record sounds like an instant classic.\n\nBacked by the sensational Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra for most of the album, the Canadian-born vocalist scats like Satchmo on a ringing version of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and then channels Ella with &quot;Let It Snow.&quot; It's hard to remember a cooler version of &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; or a jazzier rendition of &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town.&quot;\n\nWhen the singer isn't filling up-tempo songs with holiday cheer, she's absolutely melting her way through snowy-weather classics like &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; and &quot;White Christmas.&quot; Her version of &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; is achingly beautiful. The album's finest moment, however, is the bluesy take on &quot;The Christmas Song,&quot; which sounds so intimate that you might swear the sexy singer is crooning exclusively for you at of midnight on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\n\nToss that brickwalled CD in the trash. This is the version to have with no apparent compression. This is how music was meant to sound !\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; (James Pierpont) 3:26\n2. &quot;Let It Snow&quot; (Jule Styne, Sammy Cahn) 4:02\n3. &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (Mel TormÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, Robert Wells) 4:24\n4. &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; (Felix Bernard, Richard B.
