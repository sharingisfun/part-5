There have been two manifestations of the group, with Tim Hauser being the only person to be part of both. The group's name comes from John Dos Passos' 1925 novel Manhattan Transfer and refers to their New York origins.\nThe first manifestation of the group was established during 1969 in New York City by Tim Hauser, Erin Dickins, Marty Nelson, and Pat Rosalia. Gene Pistilli, a good friend, soon became an integral component, and composed for and recorded with the group. They contracted with Capitol Records, recorded several tracks, and during 1971 issued their first album, Jukin'. The album was later reissued in the UK by EMI's Music for Pleasure under the title The Manhattan Transfer and Gene Pistilli. Pistilli had been best known for his performing and songwriting collaborations with Terry Cashman and Tommy West. This team endured until 1973. According to Hauser, &quot;Gene and I were in two different places. He was more into R&amp;B, and the Memphis sound, and by then I'd become more interested in jazz and swing...&quot;\n\n.:The Manhattan Transfer:.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/4406/manhattantransf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/4406/manhattantransf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe albums\nMp3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ CBR 320 kbps\n\n1971 Jukin' @320\n1975 The Manhattan Transfer @320\n1976 Coming Out @320\n1978 Live @320\n1978 Pastiche @320\n1979 Extensions @320\n1981 Mecca For Modern @320\n1981 The Best Of The Manhattan Transfer @320\n1983 Bodies And Souls @320\n1984 Bop Doo-Wopp @320\n1985 Vocalese @320\n1987 Brasil @320\n1987 Live (At Nakano Sun Plaza Hall Tokyo) @320\n1990 Bop Doo Wopp @320\n1991 The Offbeat Of Avenues @320\n1992 Anthology - Down In Birdland (2 CD) @320\n1992 The Christmas Album @320\n1994 The Very Best Of Manhattan Transfer @320\n1994 Tonin' @320\n1997 Swing @320\n2000 The Spirit Of St. Louis @320\n2003 Couldn't Be Hotter (Live In Tokyo, 2000) @320\n2004 An Acapella Christmas @320\n2004 Vibrate @320\n2006 Feat.
