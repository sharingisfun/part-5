There was a torrent that was of the DVD files, but this is a small AVI that clocks in at about 700 MB for a faster download.  Plus, this one has a working source.\n\n\nSee http://winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html for the story behind this version of the film and several screenshots.  This is one of the funniest sources of unintentional humor I&amp;#039;ve seen in a while.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e790f191a25d763b418bc1cbca55a24737b08090","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+3%3A+Backstroke+of+The+West+%28ROTS+mistranslation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e790f191a25d763b418bc1cbca55a24737b08090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,144,241,145,162,93,118,59,65,139,193,203,202,85,162,71,55,176,128,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
