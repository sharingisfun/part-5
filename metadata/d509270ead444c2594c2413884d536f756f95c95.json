ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still plenty of time to make cards and this issue is packed with ideas. From the cuteness of the new Lili of the Valley stamps (page 18) to the nostalgia of The Snowman (page 24), if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characters youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re after, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got it covered! For a more contemporary feel, give the makes using the new Fancy Pants range (page 58) or StampinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ UpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s star stamps (page 50) a try.\nOne of my favourite projects so far this season is the poinsettia garland in our Home Style pages, the effect will transform your mantelpiece and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so simple to make! Turn to page 36 for our step-by-step guide. The most important thing about Christmas is to enjoy the season and spend time with loved ones.
