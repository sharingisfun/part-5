Without peer as a popularizer of mathematics, he is equally adept at explaining all areas. This book, another updated collection of his Scientific American columns, is a twenty member set of polished pearls. Although somewhat mundane as a descriptive adjective, the word readable fits his writing like a custom made body stocking.\nAlways interesting and entertaining, reading his essays is somewhat like eating tiny chocolate bars. You can't get enough, each seems too small, and there are no negative side effects.\nPublished in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b581e870216bda1f840627e30b52ea4ea1ecfb9e","amp;dn":"New+Mathematical+Diversions%3A+More+Puzzles%2C+Problems%2C+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b581e870216bda1f840627e30b52ea4ea1ecfb9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,129,232,112,33,107,218,31,132,6,39,227,11,82,234,78,161,236,251,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
