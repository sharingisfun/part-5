They formed in 1984 as Lucifer's Heritage by KÃƒÂ¼rsch (then also bass guitarist), Olbrich, other guitarist Markus DÃƒÂ¶rk and drummer Thomas Stauch. DÃƒÂ¶rk and Stauch both left the following year, and were replaced by Christof TheiÃƒÅ¸en and Hans-Peter Frey respectively, who left as well before the end of the year. In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band's history), the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, Battalions of Fear, in 1988.\n\nOver the releases, Blind Guardian established themselves as a notable successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement. In 1996, KÃƒÂ¼rsch stopped acting as the band's bass guitarist to focus on vocals. Various session members replaced him, mainly Oliver Holzwarth. However in 2005, Stauch left the band, disapproving of Blind Guardian's transition into a more complex progressive sound with a heavy use of backing vocals, and was replaced by Ehmke.\n\nMost of Blind Guardian's albums were well received by fans and critics alike: Somewhere Far Beyond (1992), Imaginations from the Other Side (1995), and Nightfall in Middle-Earth (1998), are especially seen as influential works. The music is mostly composed by KÃƒÂ¼rsch and Olbrich together, and the lyrics, written by KÃƒÂ¼rsch, are mostly inspired by the fiction of fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, Robert Jordan, Stephen King and George R. R. Martin as well as traditional legends and epics.[4] Over the years a theme has developed which personifies the band members as travelling storytellers, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as &quot;The Bards&quot;.\n\n\nBlind Guardian At MySpace\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Twilight Of The Gods (Single)\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

Gaps between albums seemed to stretch further and further, with the pit between &quot;At the Edge of Time&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Beyond the Red Mirror&quot; being their longest to date (almost five years of anticipatory readiness). And thus, when we couldn't really wait any longer, they present us with a sample to placate us for the storm to be unleashed not too longer afterward...\n\nAs far as the song itself goes, there's plenty to take in and enjoy. The entirety of the work rushes on by like a malevolent gust, carried by that wave of energy that overtook the group during the &quot;Edge...&quot; writing/recording sessions. That the band sounds this focused and sharp shows serious promise that the full recorded work could be nothing short of fantastic, or at least a good listen. The prerequisites of all things Blind are still here, still in potent doses, yet with a few parts getting more than expected; the rhythmic work is surprisingly thrashy and intense, the choruses still devastating and Hansi's lead vocal work as crisp and powerful as ever, so those hoping that the machine still has enough fuel and steam within it 30 years hence will walk away with quite the sore neck and a smile on the face. This is easily one of the faster and unforgiving tracks the Guardian's written in a while yet not forsaking the level of melodic progression that they've gotten so honed to a sword point, quite a bit of which is done by way of the guitars as well as the choruses, thereby expanding on the material's creative horizons and ensuring a lush, almost chaotic feel.\n\nAnd yet, things could have been better. All that said, it's a bit disappointing that, after all these years, the first glance at the next album to come sounds a little too similar to what we'd been blasting since 2010. It wouldn't be all that unrealistic to compare this to &quot;A Voice in the Dark&quot;, a track that contains a lot of the same dynamic leaps and bounds as this, so the creative mold had yet to be broken in that regard. This is still a beast truly unto itself, yet it is still clad in musical garb some may find more homologous than it needs to be. But if that's really the worst that can happen it's a relatively minor complaint given how much one can enjoy within the constructs of the song itself.\n\nThe live song additions are quite good as well, though not really as impactful as the title track due to that sense of familiarity (we already know these songs almost inside and out, so...). Blind Guardian still puts the &quot;power&quot; in their respective genre in a live setting with, quite obviously, &quot;Time Stands Still&quot; being more large and in charge than &quot;The Bard's Song&quot; just on differing intensity alone, yet neither of the tracks are without their own bouts of enjoyment as they are. So...take them for what you will.\n\nAll in all &quot;Twilight...&quot; satisfies and whets the appetite, yet with a readily familiar flavor. It's still too soon to wonder if &quot;Red Mirror...&quot; will maintain that same level of potency track by track, but if this is any indication on the direction it will head into it will, at its absolute worst, still be quite good.\n\n\nGenre:\tPower\nSubgenre:\tSpeed / Power Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t31.63 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n3 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:addbe6f8c733d4b88f82091766f9e57e9beb8c37","amp;dn":"+Blind+Guardian+-+Twilight+Of+The+Gods+%28Single%29+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"addbe6f8c733d4b88f82091766f9e57e9beb8c37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,219,230,248,199,51,212,184,143,130,9,23,102,249,229,126,155,235,140,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
