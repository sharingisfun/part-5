It was then extended in 1856 and 1859 to include Cologne Central Station. \n\nKoblenz is an important interchange in the south for services along the Mosel Valley to France and south to Mainz whilst Cologne is an important local, national and international train hub with more than 280,000 daily travellers frequenting the station. At the midpoint of the route, the former West German capital of Bonn accommodates regular ICE trains that serve much of Germany. \n\nThe route forms the southern stretch of Deutsche BahnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RE5 Ã¢â‚¬ËœRhein ExpressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ service, which runs from Emerrich in the north west to Koblenz. Hourly intercity and ICE services, Regio passenger trains and various freight operations also frequent the line. Even the occasional heritage special can be seen in between the busy commuter services. \n\nMedieval towns and castles along the line, plus river barges passing serenely by remind passengers of the historic area they travel through between the two densely urban cities of Cologne and Koblenz. Large freight yards at Bruhl and Bonn-West are also well-known features, as well as the DB Museum at Koblenz-LÃƒÂ¼tzel, which occupies a former depot linked to the main line","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb8bd1615b947bb23779169120b64bac43f1c65","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+West+Rhine%3A+Cologne+-+Koblenz+Route+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb8bd1615b947bb23779169120b64bac43f1c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,184,189,22,21,185,71,187,35,119,145,105,18,11,100,186,196,63,28,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
