It was written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Phil Jimenez, George PÃƒÂ©rez, Ivan Reis, and Jerry Ordway. Each issue was released with two variant covers: one by PÃƒÂ©rez, and one by Jim Lee and Sandra Hope.\n\nThe series storyline was a sequel to DC&amp;#039;s 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. It revisited characters and concepts from that earlier Crisis, including the existence of DC&amp;#039;s Multiverse. Some of the characters featured were alternate versions of comic icons such as an alternate Superman named Kal-L, who came from a place called Earth-Two. A major theme was the nature of heroism, contrasting the often dark and conflicted modern-day heroes with memories of &quot;lighter&quot; and ostensibly more noble and collegial heroes of American comic books&amp;#039; earlier days.\n\nThe story&amp;#039;s plot was initiated when the superheroine Donna Troy died in 2003&amp;#039;s Teen Titans/Young Justice crossover, Graduation Day. A 2004 limited series Identity Crisis also retroactively labeled[citation needed] it as a tie-in. DC officially began leading up to the new Crisis with a one-shot issue Countdown to Infinite Crisis, followed by four six-issue limited series that tied into and culminated in Infinite Crisis.\n\nOnce the Crisis was completed, DC used the One Year Later event to move the narratives of most of its DC Universe series forward by one year. The weekly series 52 began publication in May 2006, and depicts some of the events which occurred between Infinite Crisis and One Year Later.\n\n------------------------\n\nPlease read wiki link for more info, or just download.
