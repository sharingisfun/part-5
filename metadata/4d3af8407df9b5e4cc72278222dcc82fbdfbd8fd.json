Drawn to one another despite longstanding taboos, and in pursuit of DianaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spellbound powers, the two embark upon a time-walking journey.\n\nBook Two of the All Souls Trilogy plunges Diana and Matthew into  Elizabethan London, a world of spies and subterfuge, and a coterie of MatthewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old friends, the mysterious School of Night.  The mission is to locate a witch to tutor  Diana and to find traces of Ashmole 782, but as the net of MatthewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past tightens around them they embark on a very different journey, one that takes them into heart of the 1,500 year old vampireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadowed history and secrets. For Matthew Clairmont, time travel is no simple matter; nor is DianaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s search for the key to understanding her legacy.\n\nShadow of Night brings us a rich and splendid tapestry of alchemy, magic, and history, taking us through the loop of time to deliver a deepening love story, a tale of blood, passion, and the knotted strands of the past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3af8407df9b5e4cc72278222dcc82fbdfbd8fd","amp;dn":"Deborah+Harkness+-+Shadow+of+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3af8407df9b5e4cc72278222dcc82fbdfbd8fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,58,248,64,125,249,181,228,204,114,39,130,34,220,200,47,189,251,216,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
