WhatÃƒÂ¢??s trance you ask (me too)? Trance is a form of electronic dance music that has a repeating beats and melodies that possibly puts the club dancers into a trance-like state.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢??s a lot of this on this album so you might find yourself hypnotized by the repetition of the beats. What Tiesto (sometimes called DJ Tiesto) is known for is playing live at the opening ceremonies of the 2004 Olympic games in Athens, Greece. He is also one of the official worldwide ambassadors of the Dance4Life Foundation (www.dance4life.com), which fights the spread of HIV/AIDS. He has collaborations with JES (ÃƒÂ¢??EverythingÃƒÂ¢??), Julie Thompson (ÃƒÂ¢??Do You Feel MeÃƒÂ¢??), Charlotte Martin (ÃƒÂ¢??Sweet ThingsÃƒÂ¢??), Christian Burns (ÃƒÂ¢??In the DarkÃƒÂ¢??), and Maxi Jazz (ÃƒÂ¢??Dance4LifeÃƒÂ¢??). ThereÃƒÂ¢??s also a track called ÃƒÂ¢??HeÃƒÂ¢??s a PirateÃƒÂ¢?? which features music and Johnny Depp dialogue from Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nI thought that this would make a good CD to have if you want to dance your place or create a club atmosphere at the parties in your crib. I do wonder if you listen to it while driving down the street if you might go into a trance and crash your car into a tree - just kidding (maybe).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78a14cd061b6b25e8deff65e3399693620f81f02","amp;dn":"Tiesto+-+Elements+Of+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78a14cd061b6b25e8deff65e3399693620f81f02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,161,76,208,97,182,178,94,141,239,246,94,51,153,105,54,32,248,31,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
