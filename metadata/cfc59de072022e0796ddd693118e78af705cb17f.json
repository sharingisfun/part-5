Everclear's sound reflected the rock, post-punk, and singer/songwriter influences of frontman Alexakis, including acts like X, the Replacements, the Pixies, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Elvis Costello. Also instrumental to Everclear's success was the group's obsessive touring schedule and aggressive self-promotion tactics. \n\nInvisible Stars was the comeback, the record where Everclear returned to action, but its 2015 sequel, Black Is the New Black, is where Art Alexakis' reconstituted band settles into a new groove. As the dad joke of the title suggests, the new groove is an old groove, a revival of the gnarliest, toughest parts of the group's '90s heyday, and that doesn't just apply to the sound, either. Alexakis litters Black Is the New Black with allusions to monsters, abuse, broken dreams, and other assorted nastiness. It's enough ugliness to sometimes seem like shtick, but Alexakis dodges this pitfall by getting heavier and tighter, sharpening the songs and generally relying on craft over energy. It's a gambit that works: it's defiantly old-fashioned without being stodgy, probably because the tunes click and there's muscle behind the riffs, giving Black Is the New Black both a foundation and a kick. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Sugar Noise\n02.The Man Who Broke His Own Heart\n03.American Monster\n04.Complacent\n05.You\n06.This Is Your Death Song\n07.Simple And Plain\n08.Anything Is Better Than This\n09.Van Gogh Sun\n10.Pretty Bomb\n11.Safe\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc59de072022e0796ddd693118e78af705cb17f","amp;dn":"Everclear+-+Black+Is+The+New+Black+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfc59de072022e0796ddd693118e78af705cb17f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,197,157,224,114,2,46,7,150,221,214,147,17,142,120,175,112,92,177,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
