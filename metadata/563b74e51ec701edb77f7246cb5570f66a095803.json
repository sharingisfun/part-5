His historicist and idealist account of reality revolutionized European philosophy and was an important precursor to Continental philosophy and Marxism.\n\nHegel developed a comprehensive philosophical framework, or &quot;system&quot;, of Absolute idealism to account in an integrated and developmental way for the relation of mind and nature, the subject and object of knowledge, psychology, the state, history, art, religion, and philosophy. In particular, he developed the concept that mind or spirit manifested itself in a set of contradictions and oppositions that it ultimately integrated and united, without eliminating either pole or reducing one to the other. Examples of such contradictions include those between nature and freedom, and between immanence and transcendence.\n\nMichel Foucault contended that contemporary philosophers may be &quot;doomed to find Hegel waiting patiently at the end of whatever road we travel.&quot; Hegel's influential conceptions are of speculative logic or &quot;dialectic&quot;, &quot;absolute idealism&quot;. They include &quot;Geist&quot; (spirit), negativity, sublation (Aufhebung in German), the &quot;Master/Slave&quot; dialectic, &quot;ethical life&quot; and the importance of history.\n\nA number of Hegel's major works appear here in multiple translations, including the PHILOSOPHY OF RIGHT, the SCIENCE OF LOGIC, the PHILOSOPHY OF WORLD HISTORY, and the PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT.\n\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all of the following volumes are PDFs (three also appear in EPUB format):\n\n* AESTHETICS: LECTURES ON FINE ART, Vol. 1 (Clarendon Press, 1975).
