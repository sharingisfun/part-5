Besides the painstaking animation work by Pearce Studios and a few days location filming, each episode was made in only one day in a standard TV studio (one day every fortnight). The budget - which suddenly became available when a &amp;#039;Goodies&amp;#039; series was cancelled - was a total of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£600,000 and went over budget by Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£60,000. Feature film motion-control effects were considered, but the cost would have limited the scope of the episodes - only two effects could have been afforded in every episode). So it was decided that the effects would be done more simply - but with a serious attempt to make them better than previous TV Video effects. Sandra Dickinson was cast as Trillion following extensive auditions when she showed an excellent sense of comedy, and Douglas Adams agreed that she was perfect.\n\nSo basically, it was just a TV series with all the imposed limitations of time and money. I am looking forward to the release of the movie version, which will, no doubt, be fantastic (I hope so). And I, by far, much preferred the Radio version.\n\nP.S. I produced and directed the TV series.\n\n^^^^^dlya perevoda subtitrov na russki yazyk (http://notabenoid.com/)^^^^^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fef866d88fbda9c58d7eba7d72563852a8548ce","amp;dn":"Hitch+Hikers+Guide+to+the+Galaxy%2C+The+%281981%29+-+MiniSeries+-+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fef866d88fbda9c58d7eba7d72563852a8548ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,239,134,109,136,251,218,156,88,215,235,167,215,37,99,133,42,133,72,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
