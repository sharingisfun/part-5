These essays really underscore the staying power of this film and confirm its reputation as a masterpiece. Yet the essays chosen do not fawn. Some are ambivalent in some regards; one is decidedly negative. All are thought-provoking.\n\nA lovely book. In paperback, for the price I most heartily recommend it.\n\nImprescindible, sobre todo para entender mejor la pelicula 20 March 2010\nBy Diego Ballesteros Marin -\nEs el 2* libro que leo en mi kindle, y tengo que decir que es imprescindible de leer, sobre todo a los que nos encanto la pelicula, que tambien es imprescindible de ver.\n\nbooks in spanish, please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8d1265155ef6435acf6d949fb65a34d170e6d09","amp;dn":"Stanley+Kubrick%27s+2001+A+Space+Odyssey+New+Essays%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8d1265155ef6435acf6d949fb65a34d170e6d09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,209,38,81,85,239,100,53,172,246,217,73,251,101,163,77,23,14,109,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
