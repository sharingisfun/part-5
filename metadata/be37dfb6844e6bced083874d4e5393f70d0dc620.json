The day before the transport\nthe son of a Jewish mother dies. In his place and with his name (Schlomo)\nshe takes a Christian 9-year-old boy. Upon arrival this second mother \ndies. Schlomo is adopted by a good family but remains depressed until he\nsecretly sends a letter to his real mother. From the beginning he \nexperiences large and small racist difficulties. In his teens he and Sarah\nfall in love. Her father is an extreme racist. Schlomo tries to gain \n&quot;real Jewishness&quot; by winning a competition in Bible interpretation. \nNo change of Sarah's father's attitude. Disappointed he goes to the police\nand reports himself as not being a Jew. But the police officer just gives\nhim a scolding. &quot;The newspapers are full of that stuff, the Falashas are \nno Jews. Now they begin to believe it themselves.&quot; His adoptive parents\nsend him to France to study medicine. When he afterwards marries Sarah she\nloses her family and her status as a &quot;white Jew&quot;. But he dares not tell \nher the truth until she becomes pregnant. She leaves him, but only because\nhe had not trusted that she would love him as much anyway. His adoptive \nmother reconciles them. Sarah's first line when she returns: &quot;Unbelievable\nwhat three mothers would do for you.&quot; But she makes a condition for \nreturning: Schlomo must meet his real mother again. As a doctor he takes a\njob in the Ethiopian fugitive camp where she is still alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be37dfb6844e6bced083874d4e5393f70d0dc620","amp;dn":"Va.Vis.Et.Deviens.2005.FRENCH.DVBRip.XviD-Movieboys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be37dfb6844e6bced083874d4e5393f70d0dc620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,55,223,182,132,78,107,206,208,131,135,77,78,83,147,247,13,13,198,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
