The projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s goal is to show that the ability to control the bodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s temperature is not a genetic defect in Wim, but an ability that can be adopted by everyone.\n\nFor many generations, we have been taught to fear the cold:\n\n*ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t forget your jacket! You donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want hypothermia, do you?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n*ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPut your gloves on before you get frostbite!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nOf course, these are consequences of extreme cold exposure, but with the proper understanding, anyone can learn to use the cold as a natural teacher. \n\nYou may have seen Wim running around on television, barefoot in the snow or swimming in ice-cold waters. While he is doing those incredible feats, he isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t in pain and hoping that he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t lose his fingers or toes; he is enjoying himself and having fun!\n\nLike any new tool, you must understand how it works before you can use it efficiently. This pertains to the cold as well. Wim is the epitome of what can happen if someone uses the cold to train the body.\n\nYou might ask, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow can you prove that anyone can learn this ability?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re glad you askedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nAs of Fall 2009, Justin Rosales had no experience with the cold whatsoever. He was a college student attending Penn State University. After JustinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friend, Jarrett, showed him one of WimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s videos on YouTube, they became exceedingly interested in understanding this ability. They wanted to see if it was possible for anyone to learn. So they thought, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhy not test it on ourselves?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn Spring 2010, after speaking to Wim for several months via email, Wim invited Justin to attend a workshop in Poland for ten days. After many days of working as a dishwasher, Justin was able to pay for his trip to Poland and learn the technique of the Iceman.\n\nWith more training and countless experiences with the cold, Justin began to slowly adapt. The length of time he could remain exposed to the cold increased dramatically. He quickly realized that technique to withstand the cold was, indeed, an ability that could be learned by anyone.\n\nThis book tells the tale of Wim and JustinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journey to Becoming the Iceman!\n\n\n\nFor more information on Becoming the Iceman, please visit:\n\nwww.becomingtheiceman.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fb31cb862386262ee7b070cafbbdf64066dc425","amp;dn":"Becoming+the+Iceman+-+Pushing+Past+Perceived+Limits+-+Wim+Hof.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fb31cb862386262ee7b070cafbbdf64066dc425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,179,28,184,98,56,98,98,238,123,7,12,175,187,223,100,6,109,196,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
