Vangelis was asked to provide the highlight of the event.\nThe concert took place at the docks in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A floating stage was constructed. Vangelis was seated in the middle, surrounded by his synths and some classically Greek styled props. He was backed up by a choir.\nTo accompany the music some buildings in the neighborhood were used for projections with colors and laser animations. Furthermore there were participating choppers, boats and movable cranes.\nJon Anderson appeared as guest for the track &quot;Italian Song&quot; and Markella Hatziano (who reportedly tripped over the wiring afterwards) appeared for &quot;Glorianna&quot;. \nThe concert attracted an audience of more than 150,000 spectators.\n\n01.Making Of\n02.Intro\n03.Chariots Of Fire\n04.Spiral\n05.Antarctica (Pt.7)\n06.China\n07.Pulstar (Albedo)\n08.Mask (Pt.2)\n09.Italian Song (ft.
