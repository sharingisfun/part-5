They are all rips found on TPB - none ripped by me.\nI just upload it now, as I can't seem to find other active torrents for their fantastic catalog.\n\n(&quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is missing, since all I found is a &quot;video ts&quot; folder of no interest.)\n\nThe films included are all DivX encoded .avi files of good quality (full length, no trailers):\n\nBarton Fink\nBlood Simple\nBurn After Reading\nCrimewave\nFargo\nMillers Crossing\nNo Country For Old Men\nRaising Arizona\nThe Big Lebowsky\nThe Hudsucker Proxy\nThe Ladykillers\nThe Man Who Wasn't There\n\nAnd throwing a bone for the enthusiasts, as well:\n\nThe original &quot;Ladykillers&quot; from 1955 w/ P. Sellers and Sir Alec Guinness is included for comparision.\n\nSEED!  SEED!  SEED!  SEED!
