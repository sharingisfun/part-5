How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in Naked Statistics, the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more.\n \nFor those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions.\n \nAnd in WheelanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark style, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a dull page in sight. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Make a DealÃ¢â‚¬â€and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come away with insights each time. With the wit, accessibility, and sheer fun that turned Naked Economics into a bestseller, Wheelan defies the odds yet again by bringing another essential, formerly unglamorous discipline to life.\n\n2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d21a16bcfaef0eed830b78578150e2a24eb55218","amp;dn":"Naked+Statistics%3A+Stripping+the+Dread+from+the+Data+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d21a16bcfaef0eed830b78578150e2a24eb55218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,26,22,188,250,239,14,237,131,11,120,87,129,80,226,162,78,181,82,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
