Still, 2006's ULTIMATE LUTHER VANDROSS, which modified the track list of the 2001 collection of the same name, does an admirable job of capturing the artist's achievement. Naturally, the set includes the singer's biggest hits, including &quot;Here and Now,&quot; &quot;The Power of Love/Love Power,&quot; and &quot;Don't Want to Be a Fool,&quot; among many others, but this version of ULTIMATE has the jump on the earlier version with its inclusion of songs from Vandross's highly successful 2003 release DANCE WITH MY FATHER, including the dramatically moving title track and his duet with Beyonce on &quot;The Closer I Get to You.&quot; A duet with Mariah Carey and two previously unreleased tracks (&quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Got You Home&quot;. His genius lay in his extraordinary voice: smooth, soulful and oozing a defiantly non-sexual courtly romance. 'So Amazing' and 'Give Me The Reason' were the most soulful things you were going to get in the late '80s....A fantastic reminder of a fascinating artist who left us too early.&quot;\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Never Too Much\n[02] Give Me The Reason\n[03] Shine\n[04] Your Secret Love\n[05] Dance With My Father\n[06] I Really Didn't Mean It\n[07] Stop To Love\n[08] Searching (By Change)\n[09] Take You Out\n[10] Got You Home\n[11] Power Of Love/Love Power\n[12] So Amazing\n[13] Buy Me A Rose\n[14] Love The One You're With\n[15] Any Love\n[16] Always And Forever\n[17] The Closer I Get To You - - - Luther Vandross Duet With BeyoncÃƒÂ©\n[18] Endless Love - - - Luther Vandross Duet With Mariah Carey\n[19] Shine (Freemasons Mixshow Radio Edit)\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:18 51m:s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 530mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
