According to bandmembers, none of whom were born before 1983, the lack of anything to do in their hometown, coupled with a rich musical background in their community and families, led them to start playing music. Lead vocalist and guitarist Chris Robertson met drummer John Fred Young (the son of Kentucky Headhunters' Richard Young) in school, and the two played music together throughout high school.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbum................: Black Stone Cherry\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2006-2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Log, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\nDiscography:\n\n\n2006 - Black Stone Cherry\n\n2007 - Live At The Astoria, London (31.10.07)\n\n2008 - Folklore And Superstition\n\n2011 - Between The Devil &amp; The Deep Blue Sea (Special Edition)\n\n2014 - Magic Mountain\n\n2014 - Hits, Rarities And Live \n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0890860eec5ab28674c08cc488c838029dda35ae","amp;dn":"Black+Stone+Cherry+-+Discography+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0890860eec5ab28674c08cc488c838029dda35ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,144,134,14,236,90,178,134,116,192,140,196,136,200,56,2,157,218,53,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
