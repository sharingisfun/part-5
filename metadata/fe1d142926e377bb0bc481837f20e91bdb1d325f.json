His albums began to appear in 1966, but it was not until the start of the '70s that he became a big success as a performer, scoring in 1970 with Sit Down Young Stranger, which contained his hit &quot;If You Could Read My Mind,&quot; a song with a typically flowing melodic line and gently poetic lyrics.\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nOriginal Release:\t1975\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.I'm Not Sayin'-Ribbon Of Darkness\n02.Song For A Winter's Night\n03.Canadian Railroad Trilogy\n04.Softly\n05.For Lovin' Me-Did She Mention My Name\n06.Steel Rail Blues\n07.Wherefore And Why\n08.Bitter Green\n09.Early Morning Rain\n10.Minstrel Of The Dawn\n11.Sundown\n12.Beautiful\n13.Summer Side Of Life\n14.Rainy Day People\n15.Cotton Jenny\n16.Don Quixote\n17.Circle Of Steel\n18.Old Dan's Records\n19.If You Could Read My Mind\n20.Cold On The Shoulder\n21.Carefree Highway\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1d142926e377bb0bc481837f20e91bdb1d325f","amp;dn":"Gordon+Lightfoot+-+Gord%5C%27s+Gold+%281990%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1d142926e377bb0bc481837f20e91bdb1d325f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,29,20,41,38,227,119,187,11,196,129,131,127,32,233,27,219,29,50,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
