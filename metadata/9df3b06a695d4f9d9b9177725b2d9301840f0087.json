PÃƒÂ¤rt&amp;#039;s friend Dorian Supin filmed him intermittently working (at home and with various performers), rehearsing, and reminiscing about his life, over a five-year period. The result is 24 loosely connected vignettes that, while containing no earth-shattering revelations, shed light on both PÃƒÂ¤rt&amp;#039;s lively mind and his beautiful, haunting compositions.\n\nIMDB: 7.5/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358947/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358947/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9df3b06a695d4f9d9b9177725b2d9301840f0087","amp;dn":"Arvo+Part+-+24+Preludes+for+a+Fugue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9df3b06a695d4f9d9b9177725b2d9301840f0087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,243,176,106,105,93,79,157,155,145,119,114,91,45,147,1,132,15,0,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
