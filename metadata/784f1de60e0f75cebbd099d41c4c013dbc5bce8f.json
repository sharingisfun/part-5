The show staged a premiere performance on June 27th 1996 - the video was filmed on July 2, 1996. The story follows the character &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; and his fight against the evil dark lord &quot;Don Dorcha&quot; from taking over Planet Ireland. The &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; defeats the dark lord's invasion with help from a little spirit. There is also a story with a &quot;love vs lust&quot; theme expressed through dance throughout the show. &quot;Saoirse, the Irish CailÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n&quot; fights for the love of the &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; against the wicked &quot;Morrighan, the Temptress&quot;. The stories are based on ancient Irish folklore and some Biblical references; the title itself, along with the central musical theme, is taken from a contemporary hymn.\n\nIn March 1997, Lord of the Dance was performed at the Oscars.
