He received the 1975 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his distinctive poetry which, with great artistic sensitivity, has interpreted human values under the sign of an outlook on life with no illusions.&quot;\r\n\r\nMontale is widely recognized as having brought the great Italian lyric tradition that began with Dante into the twentieth century with unrivaled power and brilliance.  He is a love poet whose deeply beautiful, individual work confronts the dilemmas of modern history, philosophy, and faith with courage and subtlety.  He has been widely translated into English and his work has influenced two generations of American and British poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF format: \r\n\r\n* Collected Poems, 1920-1954 (FSG, 1998).
