Well, there are moments on the quirky, off-kilter Cocktails and Ruby Slippers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most notably the opening minute or so Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that are deliberately dissonant and shrill, and the up-tempo, near rambunctiousness of Loathsome M recalls The Cramps by way of Sleater-Kinney. But on the whole, the cabaret dramatics of these compositions are more melodic and tuneful, if incredibly varied.\nSoviet Trumpeter, an atmospheric waltz that tingles and tinkles with a fragile piano leitmotif, sounds like a Danny Elfman score to an animated feature film that Tim BurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yet to make. Elsewhere, Rock-Paper-Scissors is a straightforward, catchy pop song, albeit one with a traditional Irish jig serving as its foundation. It offers a stark contrast to GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Great Dust Storm, the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s melancholy, moody and gospel-inspired closer, which sounds nothing like anything preceding it.\nBut then, that could be said for all the songs here. They all share the same musical fabric, and are clearly recognisable as the product of these four furtive, inventive minds (and their many instruments), but each is quite distinct from the next. The result is an album that brims with an inspiring creativity, but which always puts the songs first.\nPeculiar and unconventional, this is an album which constantly shape-shifts and surprises, but does so with a graceful, effortless ease that feels incredibly natural and utterly delightful.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ee2a162c8d99c5375aa77d030f98de03dc1805","amp;dn":"Katzenjammer+-+A+Kiss+Before+You+Go+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ee2a162c8d99c5375aa77d030f98de03dc1805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,238,42,22,44,141,153,197,55,90,167,125,3,15,152,222,3,220,24,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
