We get a Corey Feldman update, Ant talks about a Rotgut reunion, Maureen McCormick on DWTS, the rest of the â€œstarsâ€ on this seasonâ€™s DWTS, we learn about Terra Jole, go through some of the mini-cast at Beacherâ€™s Madhouse, and basically get suck into a midget hole. Ant then goes on to discuss incest â€œcatching on,â€ auto options in cars, shark attacks, the shooting of Tyree King, Bank of Americaâ€™s thoughts on The Matrix, Bill Nye on virtual reality, Pat Dixon pops in and the guys check in on some breaking neighborhood news, they chat about assholes on trains, and better ways to cause havoc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abe07bec2d96f81479b49f9532a1c0e197f983d4","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-09-15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abe07bec2d96f81479b49f9532a1c0e197f983d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,224,123,236,45,150,248,20,121,180,159,149,50,161,192,225,151,249,131,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
