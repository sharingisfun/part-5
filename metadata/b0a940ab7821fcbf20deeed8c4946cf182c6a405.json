At first when Rollins reappeared his style was virtually unchanged from 1959 but gradually it loosened up and became freer. This attractive two-fer, which is highlighted by &quot;Without a Song,&quot; &quot;Don't Stop the Carnival&quot; and &quot;If Ever I Would Leave You,&quot; has important music that is essential for all Sonny Rollins collectors.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1- God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog, Jr.)\n\n2- John S.
