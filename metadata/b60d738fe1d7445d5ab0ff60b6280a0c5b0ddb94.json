If you already have ADO.NET experience, you can skip ahead.\n- In section 2, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll quickly be creating database applications using Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools like data sources.\n- In section 3, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll build 3-layer applications the way the pros do, with presentation, business, and database classes. This is where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get into ADO.NET coding to create your own classes. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to use object data sources to make this approach even more effective.\n- In section 4, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll develop database applications for the web using ASP.NET 4 data controls like GridView and DetailsView, along with object data sources.\n- In section 5, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll complete the set of skills that every .NET database programmer should have by learning how to (1) handle XML data in your applications, (2) create reports with Visual StudioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Report Designer and the ReportViewer control, (3) use LINQ to SQL to query datasets and SQL Server databases, and (4) use the Entity Framework and LINQ to Entities to work with database data through an Entity Data Model.\n\nNow in its 4th Edition, this book shows C# developers how to use Visual Studio and ADO.NET to develop database applications the way the best professionals do. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to:\n\n- quickly create Windows and web applications by dragging-and-dropping data controls in Visual Studio 2010\n- code your own presentation, business, and database classes with ADO.NET 4 to build 3-layer applicationsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the route the professionals take for flexibility and control\n- display and manipulate data in web applications by using ASP.NET data controls designed specifically for that purpose, like GridView and DetailsView\n- work with XML-specific features of ADO.NET to read, write, and manipulate XML data in your applications\n- use Visual StudioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Report Designer and ReportViewer control to create and display reports in both Windows and web applications\n- use LINQ to SQL instead of standard SQL so you can query databases using C# constructs\n- create Entity Data Models so you can use LINQ to Entities to work with business objects, like invoices, while the Entity Framework handles the database details\n\nPractice exercises at the end of every chapter and complete database applications throughout help you master every skill along the way. And MurachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctive Ã¢â‚¬Å“paired-pagesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ formatÃ¢â‚¬Â¦where each skill is presented with examples and advice in a single 2-page spreadÃ¢â‚¬Â¦is great for both targeted learning and reference.\n\nTable of Contents\nSection 1.
