There could probably be less embarrassing places for a family reunion than at a drunken cherry- blossom-viewing party Ã¢â‚¬â€ but unfortunately, Asuka isn't picking the occasion!&quot;\n\nV5 - &quot;Shinji and Rei enter the plugs side by side for their new synchro test, where Rei is given the task to find her way out of an imaginary cityscape, and Shinji is given the job of helping her concentrate Ã¢â‚¬â€ but how likely is that, with all the chaos happening in their personal lives, a chaos everyone seems eager to encourage? \n\nVolume 5 includes your fan art, letters, and special giveaways Ã¢â‚¬â€ plus, an exclusive preview of the brand-new Evangelion manga title starting in August from Dark Horse: Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse!&quot;\n\nV6 - &quot;Shinji is never quite sure whether he's in a relationship or just some sort of bizarre lab experiment, and he probably didn't need yet another cute, mysterious individual to arrive in his homeroom. But that's just what he's going to get in the person of Mana Kirishima. Will she prove to be a girlfriend of steel... or more of an iron maiden?&quot;\n\nThanks to BlurPixel-Empire for the digital copies.
