Will feverfew help my migraines? Are there any vitamins that will keep my skin clear? Does lysine really prevent cold sores? Are there herbs I can take to boost my mood? Are any of these things safe?\n\nMark Moyad, MD, MPH is the only physician in the United States who has an endowed position to study vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other supplements. For the past 25 years, he's been researching supplements, using them in his practice, and traveling the country giving lectures to laypeople and physicians about what works and what's worthless in the world of drugs and supplements.\n\nBased on the latest research as well as Dr. Moyad's clinical experience, The Supplement Handbook will guide you through the proven (or debunked) treatment options for more than 100 common conditionsÃ¢â‚¬â€everything from arthritis, heartburn, and high cholesterol to fibromyalgia, migraines, and psoriasis.

He does not hesitate to point out which remedies are overhyped, useless, and even harmful.

Whether you're an alternative medicine convert or an interested-but-confused supplement novice, this comprehensive, evidence-based guide is sure to become a must-have reference in your home","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a1c0debccfa582b796ff69fa068d998d48d76b9","amp;dn":"The+Supplement+Handbook%3A+A+Trusted+Expert%27s+Guide+to+What+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a1c0debccfa582b796ff69fa068d998d48d76b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,28,13,235,204,250,88,43,121,111,246,159,160,104,217,152,212,141,118,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
