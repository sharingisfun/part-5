He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb92289f3b739b2583cb28b7fbaadb824f9ff4c3","amp;dn":"The+God+Delusion+-+Richard+Dawkins+%28Retail+epub+%26amp%3B+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb92289f3b739b2583cb28b7fbaadb824f9ff4c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,146,40,159,59,115,155,37,131,203,40,183,251,170,219,130,79,159,244,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
