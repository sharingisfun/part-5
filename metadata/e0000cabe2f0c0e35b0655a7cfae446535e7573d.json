People are busier than they have ever been, and overwhelmed with tasks of all sizes. This book contains a series of practical, proven, effective techniques that every person can use to focus on their most important tasks and get to work immediately. Each concept is reformulated and presented as part of a logical sequence of 21 ideas that leads from the most general (determining one's overall goals and objectives) to the most specific (disciplining oneself to stay at the task until it is 100% complete). Readers can use these techniques to become extremely efficient, effective, and productive, with the result that they'll get more done, feel less stress, and feel more in control and more positive and happy about their lives and work than ever before. Eat That Frog! contains the distilled essence of the very best ideas and insights on personal time management ever discovered.\n\n\nVisit http://prince213.blogspot.com/ for more...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0000cabe2f0c0e35b0655a7cfae446535e7573d","amp;dn":"Brian+Tracy+-+Eat+That+Frog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0000cabe2f0c0e35b0655a7cfae446535e7573d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,0,12,171,226,240,192,227,91,6,85,167,207,174,68,101,53,231,87,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
