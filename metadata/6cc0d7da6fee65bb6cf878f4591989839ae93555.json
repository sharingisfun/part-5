In cemeteries and desert wastes and swampy bogs, the evidence of past civilizations remains waiting to be uncovered, ominously portending mankind's own inglorious future conclusion. \n\nEven more disconcerting in H. P. Lovecraft's fictional world is that one need not even leave home to come face-to-face with the cataclysmic revelation of man's insignificance. Monsters not only skulk in underground crypts and exotic foreign lands, but swarm all around us, just out of sight.\n\nAmong the creepy tales included in this volume are &quot;He,&quot; &quot;The Moon-Bog,&quot; &quot;The Other Gods,&quot; &quot;Polaris.&quot;\n\nGenre: Horror, Weird Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc0d7da6fee65bb6cf878f4591989839ae93555","amp;dn":"The+Other+Gods+And+More+Unearthly+Tales+by+H.P.+Lovecraft","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc0d7da6fee65bb6cf878f4591989839ae93555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,192,215,218,111,238,101,187,108,248,120,244,89,25,137,131,154,233,53,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
