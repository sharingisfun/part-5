New York, Harper\nEpub retail edition Ã‚Â© OCTOBER 2012 \nISBN: 9780062218117\n\nI have also included for your convenince conversions to MOBI and PDF.\n\n\n\nFrom amazon: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Comics-Untold-Story-ebook/dp/B007HBH8DW/ref=tmm_kin_title_0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Comics-Untold-Story-ebook/dp/B007HBH8DW/ref=tmm_kin_title_0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAn unvarnished, unauthorized, behind-the-scenes account of one of the most dominant pop cultural forces in contemporary America.\n\nOperating out of a tiny office on Madison Avenue in the early 1960s, a struggling company called Marvel Comics presented a cast of brightly costumed characters distinguished by smart banter and compellingly human flaws. Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, the Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, the X-Men, DaredevilÃ¢â‚¬â€these superheroes quickly won children's hearts and sparked the imaginations of pop artists, public intellectuals, and campus radicals. Over the course of a half century, Marvel's epic universe would become the most elaborate fictional narrative in history and serve as a modern American mythology for millions of readers.\n\nThroughout this decades-long journey to becoming a multibillion-dollar enterprise, Marvel's identity has continually shifted, careening between scrappy underdog and corporate behemoth. As the company has weathered Wall Street machinations, Hollywood failures, and the collapse of the comic book market, its characters have been passed along among generations of editors, artists, and writersÃ¢â‚¬â€also known as the celebrated Marvel &quot;Bullpen.&quot; Entrusted to carry on tradition, Marvel's contributorsÃ¢â‚¬â€impoverished child prodigies, hallucinating peaceniks, and mercenary careerists among themÃ¢â‚¬â€struggled with commercial mandates, a fickle audience, and, over matters of credit and control, one another.\n\nFor the first time, Marvel Comics reveals the outsized personalities behind the scenes, including Martin Goodman, the self-made publisher who forayed into comics after a get-rich-quick tip in 1939; Stan Lee, the energetic editor who would shepherd the company through thick and thin for decades; and Jack Kirby, the World War II veteran who'd co-created Captain America in 1940 and, twenty years later, developed with Lee the bulk of the company's marquee characters in a three-year frenzy of creativity that would be the grounds for future legal battles and endless debates.\n\nDrawing on more than one hundred original interviews with Marvel insiders then and now, Marvel Comics is a story of fertile imaginations, lifelong friendships, action-packed fistfights, reformed criminals, unlikely alliances, and third-act betrayalsÃ¢â‚¬â€a narrative of one of the most extraordinary, beloved, and beleaguered pop cultural entities in America's history.\n\n\n\nReviews:\n\nSean HoweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history of Marvel makes a compulsively readable, riotous and heartbreaking version of my favorite story, that of how a bunch of weirdos changed the world. That itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all true is just frosting on the cake. (Jonathan Lethem )\n\nA warts-and-all, nail-biting mini-epic about the low-paid, unsung Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfunnybook menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ who were unwittingly creating twenty-first century pop culture. If you thought the fisticuffs were bare and bloody on the four-color page, wait Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtil you hear about what went down in the Marvel bullpen. (Patton Oswalt )\n\nA jittery, hilarious, anecdotal, and exhaustive history of the company. . . . If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a comics fan, this is essential reading. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not, then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s merely fascinating. Howe has written a biographical history of modern AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s id. (GQ )\n\nSean HoweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gripping new history lays out five decades of Marvel adventures and insanity, and will make you believe that comic-book creators have even weirder lives than their mutant creations. (Rolling Stone )\n\nMarvel Comics is a meticulous chronicle of the real secret origins of the superhero, a tragic love story about the relationship between a long parade of passionate, talented superhero devotees and the company that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love them back. (The Los Angeles Times )\n\nA superpowered must-read for anyone hooked on comics, as well as a gripping story for someone merely enlightened by a genre thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always had to fight for respect. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much more about ordinary, flawed humans than super men and women, and therein lies its excellence. (USA Today )\n\nA corporate biography of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most significant comic-book publisher and a definitive portrait of comics in American culture. . . . Howe offers vivid reporting and enticing detail. . . . The result is a book both authoritative and charmingly readable.
