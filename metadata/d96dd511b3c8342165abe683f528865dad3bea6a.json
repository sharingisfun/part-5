Twice every three days another citizen is shot, stabbed, or bludgeoned to death. At the center of this hurricane of crime is the city's homicide unit, a small brotherhood of hard men who fight for whatever justice is possible in a deadly world.\n\nDavid Simon was the first reporter ever to gain unlimited access to a homicide unit, and this electrifying book tells the true story of a year on the violent streets of an American city. The narrative follows Donald Worden, a veteran investigator; Harry Edgerton, a black detective in a mostly white unit; and Tom Pellegrini, an earnest rookie who takes on the year's most difficult case, the brutal rape and murder of an eleven-year-old girl.\n\nOriginally published fifteen years ago, Homicide became the basis for the acclaimed television show of the same name. This new edition--which includes a new introduction, an afterword, and photographs--revives this classic, riveting tale about the men who work on the dark side of the American experience.\n\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96dd511b3c8342165abe683f528865dad3bea6a","amp;dn":"Homicide%3A+A+Year+on+the+Killing+Streets+by+David+Simon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96dd511b3c8342165abe683f528865dad3bea6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,109,213,17,179,200,52,33,101,171,230,131,245,40,134,93,173,59,234,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
