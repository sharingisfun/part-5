Feared by rivals, worshipped by investors, Enron seemingly could do no wrong. Its profits rose every year; its stock price surged ever upward; its leaders were hailed as visionaries.\n\nThen a young Fortune writer, Bethany McLean, wrote an article posing a simple question - how, exactly, does Enron make its money?\n\nWithin a year Enron was facing humiliation and bankruptcy, the largest in US history, which caused Americans to lose faith in a system that rewarded top insiders with millions of dollars, while small investors lost everything. It was revealed that Enron was a company whose business was an illusion, an illusion that Wall Street was willing to accept even though they knew what the real truth was. This book - fully updated for the paperback - tells the extraordinary story of Enron's fall.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f8e6ac060bf71739b34bdf4f6af242398a4c03","amp;dn":"The+Smartest+Guys+in+the+Room+-+Bethany+McLean%2C+%26amp%3B+Peter+Elki","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f8e6ac060bf71739b34bdf4f6af242398a4c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,248,230,172,6,11,247,23,57,179,75,223,79,106,242,66,57,138,76,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
