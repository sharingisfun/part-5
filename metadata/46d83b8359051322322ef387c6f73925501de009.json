FÃƒÂ¡bio Moon and Gabriel BÃƒÂ¡ answer that question in the critical and commercial hit series that took the industry by storm, winning praise from such comics veterans as Terry Moore, Craig Thompson and Jeff Smith. Follow aspiring writer BrÃƒÂ¡s de Oliva Domingos as each chapter of DAYTRIPPER peers in at a completely different moment in his life. Moon and BÃƒÂ¡ tell a beautifully lyrical tale chronicling Domingos's entire existence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from his loves to his deaths and all the possibilities in between. Introduction by Craig Thompson (Blankets).\n\n----------\n\nWhat are the most important days of your life?\n\nMeet BrÃƒÂ¡s de Oliva Domingos. The miracle child of a world-famous Brazilian writer, BrÃƒÂ¡s spends his days penning other people's obituaries and his nights dreaming of becoming a successful author himself - writing the end of other people's stories, while his own has barely begun.\n\nBut on the day that life begins, would he even notice? Does it start at 21 when he meets the girl of his dreams? Or at 11, when he has his first kiss? Is it later in his life when his first son is born? Or earlier when he might have found his voice as a writer?\n\nEach day in BrÃƒÂ¡s's life is like a page from a book. Each one reveals the people and things who have made him who he is: his mother and father, his child and his best friend, his first love and the love of his life. And like all great stories, each day has a twist he'll never see coming...\n\nIn DAYTRIPPER, the Eisner Award-winning twin brothers FÃƒÂ¡bio Moon and Gabriel BÃƒÂ¡ tell a magical, mysterious and moving story about life itself -- a hauntingly lyrical journey that uses the quiet moments to ask the big questions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46d83b8359051322322ef387c6f73925501de009","amp;dn":"Daytripper_%282014%29_%28Deluxe_Edition%29_%28digital-Empire%29.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46d83b8359051322322ef387c6f73925501de009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,216,59,131,89,5,19,34,50,46,243,135,198,247,57,37,80,29,224,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
