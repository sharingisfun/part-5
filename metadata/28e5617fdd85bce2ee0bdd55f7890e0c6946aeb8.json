Show: Digimon Tamers (Season 3)\nEpisodes: 01-51\nLanguage: English Dub\nDate: April 1, 2001 ? March 31, 2002\nVideo: Divx 5, 3000 Kbps, 2-pass encoding\nAudio: Lame MP3, 256 Kbps, 48000 Hz\nResolution: 640x480\nRecorded From: Toon Disney's &quot;Jetix&quot;\nSize: 21.2 GB (400MB - 450MB per episode)\n\nI downloaded the other Tamers torrent around two years ago (the one around 9.18GB). Unfortunately, I wasn't happy with the quality of some of the episodes, so I decided to record and encode them myself. These episodes were all recorded to my TiVo from Toon Disney late at night (so no annoying &quot;in-show advertisements&quot; that pop up in their show that play earlier in the day). They were then burned to DVD and transferred to my computer where I applied many filters from AVISynth. The filters included Deinterlace, MFtoon, Resize, and many others to improve the visual quality. All files are virus free.\n\nHappy downloading!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28e5617fdd85bce2ee0bdd55f7890e0c6946aeb8","amp;dn":"Digimon+Tamers+%28Season+3%29+Complete+Season+-+High+Quality+%5BEnglis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28e5617fdd85bce2ee0bdd55f7890e0c6946aeb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,229,97,127,221,133,188,226,238,11,221,85,247,137,14,12,105,70,174,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
