Technical excellence for the creative musician and engineer.\n\nAlthough bx_saturator offers a mono / multi-mono version Brainworx consider the stereo M/S version of the plugin the main version which will enable you to thicken and boost any stereo signal or mix in a more discrete way than ever.\n\nIncrease the perceived volume of mixes without clipping them, or bring out delicate signals like acoustic guitars and percussion in full mixes without increasing their actual level or eq-ing them in a harsh and offensive way.\n\nDistort vocals in full mixes without loosing the punch of your drums or the clearity of your keyboard sounds and stereo guitars.\n\nThe ability to phatten and even slightly distort M &amp; S signals independently - and separately for high and low frequencies - will give you many great, fresh and inspiring sounds.\n\n\nIncrease the perceived volume of mixes without clipping them, or bring out delicate signals like acoustic guitars and percussion in full mixes without increasing their actual level or eq-ing them in a harsh and offensive way.\n\nDistort vocals in full mixes without loosing the punch of your drums or the clearity of your keyboard sounds and stereo guitars.\n\nThe ability to phatten and even slightly distort M &amp; S signals independently - and separately for high and low frequencies - will give you many great, fresh and inspiring sounds.\n\n\nChangelog\n\nVersion 1.0.3 (May 14, 2012)\n\n- fixed Mono-Maker bug that could cause sound dropouts\n- updated manual\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢   Next open the .rar file by double clicking it.
