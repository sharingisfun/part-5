Shirer's monumental study of Hitler's \nGerman empire has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of the 20th \ncentury's blackest hours. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich offers an \nunparalleled and thrillingly told examination of how Adolf Hitler nearly \nsucceeded in conquering the world. With millions of copies in print around the \nglobe, it has attained the status of a vital and enduring classic.\n\nNow, many years after the end of World War II, it may seem incredible that \nour most valued institutions and way of life were threatened by the menace \nthat Hitler and the Third Reich represented. Shirer's description of events and \nthe cast of characters who played such pivotal roles in defining the course \nEurope was to take is unforgettable.\n\nBenefiting from his many years as a reporter, and thus a personal observer \nof the rise of Nazi Germany, and availing himself of some of the 485 tons of \ndocuments from the German Foreign Office, as well as countless other \ndiaries, phone transcriptions, and other written records, meticulously kept at \nevery level by the Germans, Shirer has put together a brutally objective \naccount of how Hitler wrested political control of Germany, and planned and \nexecuted his six-year quest to dominate the world, only to see Germany go \ndown in flames.\n\nThis is a richly rewarding experience for anyone who wants to come to grips \nwith the mysterious question of how this menace to civilization ever came into \nbeing, much less was sustained for as long as it was. The answer, \nunfortunately, is that most of Germany, for a whole host of reasons, \nembraced Nazism and the fanaticism that Hitler engendered.\n\nÃ¢Å’ï¿½1990 William L.
