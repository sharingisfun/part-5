Audience And Audio\n8. Better Weather\n\n\nFrom Glasgow rises Twin Atlantic. A mix of guitar, cello, piano, drum and base create their sound and is topped off with strong Glaswegian vocals. Vivarium is a rock album with an edge.\n\nThe Opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lightspeed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is a melodic rock song; a perfect choice for the albums first single. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s polished, incredibly catchy, and professional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ideal for rounding up more fans. It sets the fast pace for the album. After supporting bands like Lostprophets, You Me at Six, Taking Back Sunday and performing at this yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Download and Sonisphere festivals, Twin Atlantic have created themselves a large fan base. These fans are wanting to be impressed and this album does just that. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Turning Into John Wayne keeps up the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fast pace ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chorus, dominated by strong and powerful guitars, helps build momentum. If the band can keep up the momentum throughout they have real talent. Audience And Audio is a track incredibly similar to Biffy ClyroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s material ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a bad thing.\n\nThe album overall is a success, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not fantastic. Unfortunately, the momentum is lost in Better Weather, it spoils the quick and lively beat of the other songs and provides a disappointing finish. Singer Sam McTrusty has perfect vocals for the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound; edgy, not perfect. The album does explain why the band have a continuously growing fan base. Twin Atlantic have produced an album to be proud of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a definite fan pleaser.\n\nHowever, the album is only eight tracks and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a shame because a few more wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have gone a miss. By the end of the album youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re left wanting more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a clever tactic.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:014805d0b85180612e72c95a871f1a89ae8a4325","amp;dn":"Twin+Atlantic+-+Vivarium+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"014805d0b85180612e72c95a871f1a89ae8a4325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,72,5,208,184,81,128,97,46,114,201,90,135,31,26,137,174,138,67,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
