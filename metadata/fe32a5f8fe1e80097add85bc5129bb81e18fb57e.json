Full of fresh human interest touches, as well as honest admiration for the police, this film combines lively entertainment with a solid chunk of social argument.\n\nSo congenial and familiar is this picture in its initial approaches, indeed, that it early assumes the characteristics of a documentary about the police. And one might suspect at the beginning that it is going to be one of those jobs describing the London &quot;bobby,&quot; his life, his workÃ¢â‚¬â€and no more. For the initial personality introductions and accumulation of pictorial evidence are centered around the &quot;bobbies&quot; of the station at Paddington Green, with quaint glimpses of their mundane duties and their prosaic habits at home.\n\nAnd in this limited area, the camera's observations are such as to stimulate genial amusement and arouse little expectation of any more. There's the &quot;bobby&quot; who knows the neighborhood children and has a hobby of raising flowers; there's the one he and his wife take in as lodger. And there's the station-house choral group. The pungent flavor of a London police station, marked by the traditional &quot;blue lamp,&quot; is in this film.\n\nBut then the accumulation of a compounding act of crime, committed by a pair of juvenile hoodlums assisted by a neighborhood girl, is smartly insinuated; and the first thing the bland observer knows, the whole film is racing pell-mell in the toils of a manhunt and chase, with one of our favorite &quot;bobbies&quot; murdered and the force, including detectives, in pursuit.\n\nT. E. B. Clarke has written a most fluid and cleverly jointed script and Basil Dearden has directed it in a stunningly naturalistic style. Especially is a sizzling wind-up in White City Stadium, with the killer pursued among the patrons and the bookies at a dog-racing meet, executed with fascinating demonstration of local atmosphere.\nAnd a large cast of excellent actors has been handled beautifully, with such well-known performers as Jack Warner and Robert Flemyng doing modest roles. Mr. Warner, Jimmy Hanley and Meredith Edwards are notably good as uniformed police, and Mr. Flemyng and Bernard Lee (of &quot;The Third Man&quot;) do detectives excellently. Dirk Bogarde is unhealthy and malevolent as the leader of the juvenile gang, with Patric Doonan and Peggy Evans playing his associates well.\n\nThis film was produced by Michael Balcon as a national service, obviously. But it was one of the most popular pictures to show in Britain last year, and it well deserved that popularity. It should meet with limited but warm success here.\n\nIntroducing PC George Dixon (Warner), charged with showing new boy Andy Mitchell (Hanley) the ropes. There is helping old ladies and giving directions, until the film takes a darker turn when Dixon is killed in a raid on a cinema. The killer (a great turn from young Bogarde) is presented as part of a new breed of post-war criminals, without a code or honour, and even the respectable criminals want to help the police track him down. While the police are presented in an idealized way, London looks a fantastic playground, never more so than in the climactic showdown at White City.\n\nDixon, of course, would be revived and live on for 20 years on TV.\n\nPerhaps the most famous crime drama in British cinema, and certainly one of Ealing StudiosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ best known films, The Blue Lamp introduced a character who would become familiar to the British public for over twenty years. P.C. George Dixon, played by the avuncular Jack Warner, was killed off halfway through this film but reappeared five years later, in remarkably good health, as the main character of the hugely popular BBC television series Dixon of Dock Green, which ran for 430 episodes between 1955 and 1976. It was the second most successful resurrection in history.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 699mb\nDuration.... 01:21:18\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 1110kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 92kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe32a5f8fe1e80097add85bc5129bb81e18fb57e","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Lamp+1950+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe32a5f8fe1e80097add85bc5129bb81e18fb57e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,50,165,248,254,30,128,9,122,221,133,188,81,41,187,129,225,143,181,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
