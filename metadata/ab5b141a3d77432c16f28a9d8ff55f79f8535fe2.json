Demos of the material were recorded with Don Dokken as vocalist; however none of those recordings are featured on the album. A self-portrait of artist Gottfried Helnwein is featured on the cover of the album. Rudolf Schenker portrays this character in the &quot;No One Like You&quot; music video. Shirts with this album artwork on them are amongst the most popular Scorpions t-shirts.\n\nThe RIAA certified Blackout Gold on June 24, 1982 and Platinum on March 8, 1984.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Blackout&quot;   \tKlaus Meine, Herman Rarebell, Sonja Kittelsen \t3:49\n2. \t&quot;Can't Live Without You&quot;   \tMeine \t3:47\n3. \t&quot;No One Like You&quot;   \tMeine \t3:57\n4. \t&quot;You Give Me All I Need&quot;   \tRarebell \t3:39\n5. \t&quot;Now!&quot;   \tMeine, Rarebell \t2:35\n6. \t&quot;Dynamite&quot;   \tMeine, Rarebell \t4:12\n7. \t&quot;Arizona&quot;   \tRarebell \t3:56\n8. \t&quot;China White&quot;   \tMeine \t6:59\n9. \t&quot;When the Smoke Is Going Down&quot;   \tMeine \t3:51\n\n\n    Klaus Meine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals\n    Matthias Jabs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead and rhythm guitars, 6-string acoustic guitar\n    Rudolf Schenker Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitars, lead guitar on tracks 4,8 and 9\n    Francis Buchholz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n    Herman Rarebell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion, backing vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5b141a3d77432c16f28a9d8ff55f79f8535fe2","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+Blackout+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5b141a3d77432c16f28a9d8ff55f79f8535fe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,91,20,26,61,119,67,44,22,242,138,157,143,245,95,121,248,83,95,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
