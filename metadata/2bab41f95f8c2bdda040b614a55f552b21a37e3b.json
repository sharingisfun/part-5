Led by brainchild, guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Michael Gira, the group was formed after the demise of his first New York outfit, Circus Mort. Swans' first lineup consisted of Gira, guitarist Sue Hanel, and drummer Jonathan Kane. The trio played with kindred spirits Sonic Youth and did some rudimentary recordings that showcased the abrasive, percussively assaultive sonics Swans were later identified with. These initial sides surfaced on the Body to Body, Job to Job compilation. A different lineup included Kane, guitarist Bob Pezzola, and Daniel Galli-Duani on saxophone; they released a self-titled EP in 1982. The personnel changed again for the band's powerful debut, Filth, issued in 1983 on Germany's Zensor imprint. It included Gira, Kane, guitarist Norman Westberg, bassist Harry Crosby, and percussionist/drummer Roli Mosimann. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.86% CDDA &amp; 99.50% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tYoung God Records\nCatalogue:\t\tYG45\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Lunacy\n02.Mother Of The World\n03.The Wolf\n04.The Seer\n05.The Seer Returns\n06.93 Ave. B Blues\n07.The Daughter Brings The Water\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Song For A Warrior\n02.Avatar\n03.A Piece Of The Sky\n04.The Apostate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bab41f95f8c2bdda040b614a55f552b21a37e3b","amp;dn":"Swans+-+The+Seer+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bab41f95f8c2bdda040b614a55f552b21a37e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,171,65,249,95,140,43,221,160,64,182,20,165,95,85,43,33,163,126,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
