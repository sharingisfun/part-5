Edited by Patrick Madrid. (3 books in EPUB/MOBI/AZW3/PDF)\r\n\r\n\r\nSurprised by Truth: 11 Converts Give the Biblical and Historical Reasons for Becoming Catholic\r\n\r\nOver 300,000 Sold!!! Powerful testimonies of Evangelicals who became Catholic These eleven personal conversion accounts are unlike any you've ever read. They're packed with biblical, theological, and historical proofs for Catholicism. Each year thousands of atheists, Evangelicals, Mormons, Fundamentalists, and Pentecostals are being surprised by Catholic truth and these converts tell you why. In his foreword Scott Hahn described his reaction to Surprised by TruthWhile reading each of these incredible journeys I laughed, cried, grunted affirmations, and basically relived my own journey into the Catholic Church. I heard echoes of my own struggles in their words. I relived the anguish I experienced on that lonely and sometimes frightening path of conversion, and I relived the deep, abiding joy of coming home. But enough, Read these stories. They're prayerful, heavy-on-doctrine, evangelical, scriptural witnesses of people who discovered that what they had once thought was the most 'unbiblical' church is really the Church of the Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurprised by Truth 2: 15 Men and Women Give the Biblical and Historical Reasons For Becoming Catholic\r\n\r\nThis collection of testimonies by people whoâ€™ve found new life in the Catholic Church is one of the most potent weapons for the Faith ever crafted! These authors donâ€™t just tell their stories â€” they also give you an insiderâ€™s view of the fatal weaknesses in the creeds and belief systems that beckon unwary Catholics every day: Fundamentalism, New Age paganism, Mormonism, materialistic hedonism, and many others. Youâ€™ll discover why these converts forsook beliefs cherished by their families and friends in order to enter the Catholic Church. Their reasons are so compelling that Catholics can use them to draw their own non-Catholic friends and relatives to the Faith. These converts will also convince wavering Catholics to stay Catholic, and theyâ€™ll bolster the faith of Catholics when anti-Catholic arguments start to make them doubt. Readers will come away with new gratitude to God for the Catholic Faith, and with a strong new tool they can use to stand proudly for that Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurprised by Truth 3: 10 More Converts Explain the Biblical and Historical Reasons for Becoming Catholic\r\n\r\nTen former Protestants tell why they chose the Catholic Church! In these dramatic and thought-provoking conversion stories, ten men and women reveal why they changed their minds about Protestantism and entered the Catholic Church. These tales will do for you what these converts had to do for themselves: answer the most common objections to the Catholic Faith â€” and answer them in terms that non-Catholics find familiar and easy to understand. These stories will remind you of the critical truth that all converts know but most others forget: churches must not be judged by the weakness of their members, but by the truth of what they teach. The closer these former Protestants looked at Catholicism, the more they found that Christ's truth is taught in its fullness only in the Catholic Church. No wonder this book is a convert maker. But these stories do more than make converts. If you're already Catholic, they help you explain your Faith to non-Catholics and leave you prouder and more grateful than ever to be in Christ's Church. So whether you're Catholic or just inquiring, Surprised by Truth 3 is the book for you!\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb665d87621c7cfa2262b535037e6e40291a3bee","amp;dn":"Surprised+by+Truth+Trilogy%3A+36+Converts+Give+Biblical+Historical","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb665d87621c7cfa2262b535037e6e40291a3bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,102,93,135,98,28,124,250,34,98,181,53,3,126,110,64,41,26,59,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
