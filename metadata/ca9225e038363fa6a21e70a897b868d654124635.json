It is concise yet thorough, well written with excellent illustrations, graphs, and tables that enhance the reading, and provides an outstanding review of the subject. I would highly recommend this to all cardiothoracic anesthesiologists, especially fellows in training.&quot;--Doody's Review Service\n\n&quot;All in all, the second edition of the Clinical Manual and Review of Transesophageal Echocardiography is a very solid entry into what I would consider the Ã¢â‚¬Å“board preparationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ category of echocardiography textbooks. The chapters are concise and well illustrated, and most have an extensive number of questions that allow readers to identify topics that they may need to review in greater depth. With expert contributing authors and sound editing, the second edition of this book would be a valuable addition to the library of anesthesiologists interested in a text covering the breadth of topics related to perioperative echocardiography.&quot;--Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia\n\n&quot;This represents a herculean editorial challenge as to the educational framework required by the various audiences who use this book to guide clinical care as well as study for Board examinations: resident, fellow, and attending physician.
