For contractual reasons, only two songs from his Mercury Records tenure (&quot;Maggie May&quot; and &quot;You Wear It Well&quot;) were included. The rest of the material is from different albums released under Warner Bros. Records.  The compilation was particularly notable for dividing the songs between rock and pop tunes on the first disc (A Night Out) and love songs on the second disc (A Night In). Also, even though most of the songs included on the album enjoyed big success (29 out of the 34 songs originally reached the Top 10 in the United Kingdom and/or the United States), many hit singles were missed-out, including US Top 10 hits as &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Infatuation&quot;, &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot; and &quot;My Heart Can't Tell You No&quot;. A particular inclusion on the album was the track &quot;In a Broken Dream&quot;, recorded by Stewart as a guest with Python Lee Jackson back in 1969. The track wasn't a hit until 1972, when Stewart was already a superstar, and then the single reached #3 in the UK. The song remained unreleased on a Rod Stewart until its inclusion on this set.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Maggie May  \n[02] Baby Jane  \n[03] Some Guys Have All The Luck  \n[04] Young Turks  \n[05] Do Ya Think I'm Sexy  \n[06] What Am I Gonna Do (I'm So In Love With You)  \n[07] Hot Legs  \n[08] You Wear It Well  \n[09] Rhythm Of My Heart  \n[10] Downtown Train  \n[11] Motown Song  \n[12] This Old Heart Of Mine-----With Ronald Isley  \n[13] Tonight I'm Yours (Don't Hurt Me)  \n[14] Ooh La La  \n[15] I Can't Deny It  \n[16] It Takes Two-----With Tina Turner  \n[17] Stay With Me-----Faces  \n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:18m:13s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Sailing  \n[02] I Don't Want To Talk About It  \n[03] Have I Told You Lately  \n[04] First cut Is The Deepest  \n[05] You're in my heart (The Final Acclaim)  \n[06] All For Love-----With Bryan Adams &amp; Sting  \n[07] Tonight's The Night (Gonna Be Alright)  \n[08] Every Beat Of My Heart  \n[09] Tom Traubert's Blues (Waltzing Matilda)  \n[10] Don't Come Around Here-----With Helicopter Girl  \n[11] Killing Of Georgie (Part I And II)  \n[12] Love Touch  \n[13] I Was Only Joking  \n[14] Ruby Tuesday  \n[15] In A Broken Dream-----Python Lee Jackson Featuring Rod Stewart\n[16] Reason To BelieveÃ‚Â¬Ã‚Â¬-----With Ron Wood [Unplugged]\n[17] In My Life  \n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:16m:43s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 02h:34m:56s\nTotal File Size....................... 1.01GBs (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
