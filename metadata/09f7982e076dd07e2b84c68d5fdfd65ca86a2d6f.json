FIXED.\n\nI have split each book up into their chapters. I've grown tired of audio books and them being broken up in random places. In the original files, there were almost 100 or way over 100 files, and I joined files, and split files to make it so that there was one file per chapter.\n\nAs far as I have been able to tell, there hasn't really been anything wrong with these files from the beginning except for the sixth book where I had to take out the &quot;End of Disk 1, Disk 2&quot; audios. But, if you find something the matter, just comment and I'll try and fix what is wrong.\n\nI've also made each book into an .m4b (audio book format) file. These are actually smaller in size, and they work perfectly on your iPod.\n\nIf you can think of anything else that needs to be fixed, or if there is a problem with any of the files, just comment, and I'll try and fix the problem.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nIf you have any requests, email me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5e372e3b303a2c3f39313067671e273f363131703d3133&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and I'll take it into consideration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f7982e076dd07e2b84c68d5fdfd65ca86a2d6f","amp;dn":"Artemis+Fowl+1-6+Audio+Books+FIXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f7982e076dd07e2b84c68d5fdfd65ca86a2d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,247,152,46,7,109,208,126,43,132,198,141,95,223,214,92,168,106,45,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
