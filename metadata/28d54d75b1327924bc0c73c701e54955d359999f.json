Families can also be modeled from scratch and shared with colleagues and clients. This course dives into Revit architectural families, a specific family type for architecture and building information modeling.â€¨â€¨Author Eric Wing shows how to model families that help you build exactly what you need for your drawings. Eric investigates profiles such as chair rails, baseboards, doors, cabinets, and shelving, as well as adaptive components. Along the way, he introduces the reference planes, parameters, and formulas necessary to build architectural families on your own.â€¨â€¨NOTE: The exercise files included in this course are compatible with Revit 2017 only. We will add 2016-compatible files soon.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with family parameters\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating a standard cover\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating chair rails, baseboards, and crown moulding profiles\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with in-place families\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating doors and hardware\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating wall cabinets\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating interior shelving\r\n\tâ€¢\tLinking family parameters\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating parametric arrays\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating massing\r\n\tâ€¢\tBuilding adaptive components\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28d54d75b1327924bc0c73c701e54955d359999f","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Architectural+Families+in+Revit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28d54d75b1327924bc0c73c701e54955d359999f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,213,77,117,177,50,121,36,188,12,115,199,1,229,73,85,211,89,153,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
