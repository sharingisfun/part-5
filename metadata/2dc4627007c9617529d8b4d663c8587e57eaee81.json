Stars abound in this release. Just look at her duet partners. It's an amazing list of history makers. Not only that, check out the composers which is another list of very talented people in their own rights. Big Papi is not a big Barbara fan but these songs are amazing.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nBy Robert Johnson\n\nThis compilation is actually more successful than THE ESSENTIAL BARBRA STREISAND, simply because it has a clear-cut purpose: collect the best of the extraordinary duets that Barbra has recorded during her long career. The tracks are not in chronological order, but that's acceptable seeing that this isn't a strict hits set.\n\nGiven that Barbra can seamless blend her voice with just about anyone, it's more than a little ironic that Barbra's best duet has been with herself, on the thundering &quot;One Bell Less To Answer/A House Is Not A Home&quot; medley. However, I'm not for certain that singing with your own overdubbed voice is really a duet. Her best &quot;true&quot; duet is with the bluesy &quot;Cryin' Time&quot; with the magnificent Ray Charles, which was recorded live on a television special.\n\nThe collaborations with fellow veterans Judy Garland and Frank Sintra are similarly winning, as are her smash hit duets with the more contemporary artists like Bryan Adams, Barry Gibb, Donna Summer, and, most poignantly, Neil Diamond. Some terrific album tracks are spotlighted, like &quot;Music Of The Night&quot; with Michael Crawford, and the soaring &quot;I Have A Love/One Hand One Heart&quot; medley with Johnny Mathis.\n\nThere are also some underrated singles releases that finally get a chance to shine. Barbra's most criticized duet is unarguably the Top 40 hit &quot;Till I Loved You&quot; with ex-flame Don Johnson, but the track is actually much better than it's reputation. The duets with Vince Gill and Kim Carnes (&quot;If You Ever Leave Me&quot; and &quot;Make No Mistake, He's Mine,&quot; respectively) both failed to reach the Top 40 on the Hot 100, but they're both as good as adult contemporary ballads get. In fact, besides the classic pairing with Garland, the Carnes duet is possibly Barbra's best vocal collaboration with another woman.\n\nThere are also two newly recorded duets. The first, the restrained &quot;I Won't Be The One To Let Go&quot; with Barry Manilow, is very good, but the closing &quot;All I Know Of Love,&quot; with Josh Gorban, is the real keeper. The song may be melodramatic and slightly generic, but Streisand and Gorban surprisingly set off vocal fireworks! This album isn't essential to all Streisand fans, but it is a top-notch collection, with expertly packaged and remastered. If nothing else, DUETS is a compilation that finally delivers what it's title promises.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBarbra Streisand - Duets\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Duets\nGenre................: Vocal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2002 11 26\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 61 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quakity Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 258kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
