Found elsewhere.\n\nEnjoy! \n\nDescription: Return once more to a galaxy far, far away with this sublime retelling of George LucasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s epic Star Wars in the style of the immortal Bard of Avon. The saga of a wise (Jedi) knight and an evil (Sith) lord, of a beautiful princess held captive and a young hero coming of age, Star Wars abounds with all the valor and villainy of ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest plays. Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Tis a tale told by fretful droids, full of faithful Wookiees and fearstome Stormtroopers, signifying...pretty much everything.\n\nReimagined in glorious iambic pentameterÃ¢â‚¬â€and complete with twenty gorgeous Elizabethan illustrations--William ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Star Wars will astound and edify Rebels and Imperials alike. Zounds! This is the book youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for.\n\nNote: I don't know if the images are included or not.  I'm downloading this as I upload it here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32b852a5c38fb78df0b1ef03efd5334a9b054f7","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare%27s+Star+Wars+-+Ian+Doescher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32b852a5c38fb78df0b1ef03efd5334a9b054f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,43,133,42,92,56,251,120,223,11,30,240,62,253,83,52,169,176,84,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
