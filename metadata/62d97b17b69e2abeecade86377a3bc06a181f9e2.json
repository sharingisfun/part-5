Lucien Cordier is the cop of this village, populated with blacks and a few whites (usually racialist and lustful). He is a washout, everyone (including his wife Huguette) humiliates him. He never arrests anyone and looks at elsewhere when a dirty trick occurs. But one day, he turns into a machiavellian exterminating angel.\n\nCast\n\nPhilippe Noiret\t        ... \tLucien Cordier\n\nIsabelle Huppert        ... \tRose Mercaillou\n\nJean-Pierre Marielle\t... \tLe Peron et son frÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re L'adjudant Georges Le Peron\nStÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane Audran\t        ... \tHuguette Cordier\nEddy Mitchell\t        ... \tNono - l'amant demeurÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© d'Huguette\nGuy Marchand\t        ... \tMarcel Chavasson\nIrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne Skobline\t        ... \tAnne - la nouvelle institutrice\nMichel Beaune\t        ... \tVanderbrouck - un nouveau riche arrogant\nJean Champion    \t... \tPriest\nVictor Garrivier\t... \tMercaillou\nGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Hernandez\t... \tLeonelli\nAbdoulaye Diop    \t... \tFÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªte Nat - le serviteur noir de Lucien\nDaniel Langlet\t        ... \tPaulo - un flic larvaire\nFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Perrot\t        ... \tLe colonel Tramichel\nRaymond Hermantier\t... \tL'aveugle\n\n\nFile Size : 1.2 GB\nDuration  : 2:08:39\n\nThis was an NTSC format DVD - I don't know if that is carried forward to the ripped (AVI) version.
