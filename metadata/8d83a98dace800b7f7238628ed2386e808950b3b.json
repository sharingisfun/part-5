Using step-by-step instructions with projects that build on the knowledge acquired in each lesson, readers will learn the fundamentals of adding interactivity to Flash files using ActionScript, starting with using prewritten Code Snippets, but progressing to customizing and writing their own ActionScript code.\n\nThe tutorials start with simple navigation and timeline control and progress through controlling animation with ActionScript; using Event Listeners and writing event-handling functions; and controlling loading of and interaction with data, text, video, sound, and images. Readers will also learn to use third-party libraries and create Adobe Air applications. This Classroom in a Book also covers the improved text-handling tools that are new to Flash Professional CS5. The companion CD provides users with all the sample files they need to complete all the projects.\n\nNote from the publisher:\n\nFREE Adobe Flash Professional CS5.5 updates are available for this title.
