From my own experience that is a good thing, I learn so much more when I create my own websites to apply the exercises to since you have to think a little and not just copy exactly what is done in the video.\n\nIf anyone needs anything else regarding JavaScript please ask in the comments and I'll do my best to get it. \n\nIf you like this course and can afford it please consider to get a subscription on Pluralsight, it's not expensive. \n\n\n--------------\nAuthored by: Eames , Cooper \nDuration: 6h 14m\nLevel: Intermediate\nReleased: 5/17/2013 \n\n\nThis course will teach you the AngularJS fundamentals required to create testable, MVC-style single page applications with AngularJS.\n\n\nIn this course you will learn how simple it is to use AngularJS to create maintainable and testable single page applications.
