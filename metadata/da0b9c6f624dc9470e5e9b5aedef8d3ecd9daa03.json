In their selection of the best 200 novels written since 1950, the editors make a case for the best and the best-loved works and argue why each should be considered a modern classic.  Enlightening, often unexpected, and always engaging this tour through the world of fiction is full of surprises, forgotten masterpieces and a valuable guide to what to read next.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
