With a superb cast (including Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall) directed by Sidney Lumet, the film won four Academy Awards and indelibly shaped how we think about corporate and media power.\n\nIn Mad As Hell, Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times recounts the surprising and dramatic story of how Network made it to the screen. Such a movie rarely gets made any moreÃ¢â‚¬â€one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision of the world, independent of studio testing or market research. And that man was Paddy Chayefsky, the tough, driven, Oscar-winning screenwriter whose visionÃ¢â‚¬â€outlandish for its timeÃ¢â‚¬â€is all too real today. Itzkoff uses interviews with the cast and crew, as well as ChayefskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notes, letters, and drafts to re-create the action in front of and behind the camera at a time of swirling cultural turmoil. The result is a riveting account that enriches our appreciation of this prophetic and still-startling film.\n\nItzkoff also speaks with todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading broadcasters and filmmakers to assess NetworkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lasting impact on television and popular culture. They testify to the enduring genius of Paddy Chayefsky, who foresaw the future and whose life offers an unforgettable lesson about the true cost of self-expression.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDave Itzkoff is a culture reporter at The New York Times, where he writes regularly about film, television, theater, music, and popular culture.
