Kos International Airport &quot;Hippocrates&quot; is situated in an idyllic atmosphere, directly by the sea and between two ridges. It is particularly approached by European charter airlines during the summer.\n\nThe airport is a faithful copy of all original airport buildings. Accommodated landclasses, coastlines, and a detailed mesh for the entire island ensure that the airport is beautifully embedded in the countryside. Various details, different scenery-effects and many little objects provide a lively atmosphere at the airport.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c897a3d84de7e79b0d0d059e8475259179e2d5c","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Aerosoft+-+Kos+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c897a3d84de7e79b0d0d059e8475259179e2d5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,137,122,61,132,222,126,121,176,208,208,89,232,71,82,89,23,158,45,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
