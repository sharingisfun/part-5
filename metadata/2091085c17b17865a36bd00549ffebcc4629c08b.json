Madcap but sincere, pulsating with strong social and philosophical undercurrents, his irreverent classics have introduced \n\ncountless readers to natural born hitchhiking cowgirls, born-again monkeys, a philosophizing can of beans, exiled royalty, and problematic redheads.\n\nIn Tibetan Peach Pie, Robbins turns that unparalleled literary sensibility inward, stitching together stories of his unconventional life, from his Appalachian childhood to his \n\nglobetrotting adventures Ã¢â‚¬â€told in his unique voice that combines the sweet and sly, the spiritual and earthy. The grandchild of Baptist preachers, Robbins would become over the \n\ncourse of half a century a poet-interruptus, an air force weatherman, a radio dj, an art-critic-turned-psychedelic-journeyman, a world-famous novelist, and a counter-culture \n\nhero, leading a life as unlikely, magical, and bizarre as those of his quixotic characters.\n\nRobbins offers intimate snapshots of Appalachia during the Great Depression, the West Coast during the Sixties psychedelic revolution, international roving before homeland \n\nsecurity monitored our travels, and New York publishing when it still relied on trees. Written with the big-hearted comedy and mesmerizing linguistic invention for which he is \n\nknown, Tibetan Peach Pie is an invitation into the private world of a literary legend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2091085c17b17865a36bd00549ffebcc4629c08b","amp;dn":"Tibetan+Peach+Pie+-+Tom+Robbins+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2091085c17b17865a36bd00549ffebcc4629c08b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,145,8,92,23,177,120,101,163,107,208,5,73,255,235,204,70,41,192,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
