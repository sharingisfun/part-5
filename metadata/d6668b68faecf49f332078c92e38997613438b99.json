Yet Celaena is far from loyal to the crown â€“ a secret she hides from even her most intimate confidantes.\r\n\r\nKeeping up the deadly charadeâ€”while pretending to do the king's biddingâ€”will test her in frightening new ways, especially when she's given a task that could jeopardize everything she's come to care for. And there are far more dangerous forces gathering on the horizon -- forces that threaten to destroy her entire world, and will surely force Celaena to make a choice.\r\n\r\nWhere do the assassinâ€™s loyalties lie, and who is she most willing to fight for?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6668b68faecf49f332078c92e38997613438b99","amp;dn":"Sarah+J.+Maas+-+Crown+of+Midnight+%28Throne+of+Glass+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6668b68faecf49f332078c92e38997613438b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,102,139,104,250,236,244,159,51,32,120,201,46,56,153,118,19,67,139,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
