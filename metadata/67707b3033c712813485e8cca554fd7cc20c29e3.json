It is already in wide use and has been for decades, even by oncologists who do not want their patients dropping dead too quickly because of the tremendous toxicity of their treatments. Sodium bicarbonate is used routinely to keep the toxicity of chemotherapy agents and radiation from killing people or from destroying their kidneys. In relation to bicarbonate, millions of people in the world either consume bicarbonate ions in drinking water or have been treated clinically with bicarbonate in hospitals, medical centers, or emergency.  Sodium bicarbonate helps to save countless lives every day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67707b3033c712813485e8cca554fd7cc20c29e3","amp;dn":"Marc+Sircus+-+Sodium+Bicarbonate+Rich+Man%26rsquo%3Bs+Poor+Man%26rsquo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67707b3033c712813485e8cca554fd7cc20c29e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,112,123,48,51,199,18,129,52,133,232,204,165,84,253,124,194,12,41,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
