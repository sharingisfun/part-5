The great masterworks of our ancestors spoke to humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s higher nature. Architect Herbert Bangs reveals how todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dysfunctional buildings bring out the worst in humanity, reinforcing that which is most base within us. He shows how, through the ancient laws of proportion and number, architecture once expressed the harmonious relationship between man and the cosmos. In early times, the architect worked within a sacred and esoteric tradition of creating structures through which human beings could gain insight into the nature of the divine reality. Today, that tradition has been abandoned in favor of narrowly defined utilitarian principles of efficiency and economy.\n\nIn The Return of Sacred Architecture, Bangs provides the key to freeing architecture from the crude functionality of the twentieth century: the architects of the modern human landscape must find the deep-felt connection to the cosmos that guided the inner lives of those who built the temples of the past. The form of their buildings will then reflect the sacred patterns of geometry and proportion and bring forth greater harmony in the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:349c351a8560eccffa989ab951bbaa92c6d068f9","amp;dn":"The+Return+of+Sacred+Architecture+-+The+Golden+Ratio+and+the+End","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"349c351a8560eccffa989ab951bbaa92c6d068f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,156,53,26,133,96,236,207,250,152,154,185,81,187,170,146,198,208,104,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
