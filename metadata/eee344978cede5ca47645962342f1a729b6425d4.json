In 1963, piper Paddy Moloney founded The Chieftains with the intention of taking the efforts of Ceoltoiri Chaulann even further.  The Chieftains were successful from the start, peforming and recording in both Ireland and England.  They were discovered around the mid 70s by Irish-American listeners who enjoyed Irish folk music that was about something other than Ireland's many grievances with England.  They made it big with &quot;Women of Ireland&quot; which first appeared in Stanly Kubric's movie, &quot;Barry Lyndon.  The song received air play on progressive rock stations and even made it to some Top 40s stations.\n\nDisc 1\n1.  DÃƒÂ³chas, King of Laois, Paddy's Jig, O'Keefes, Chattering Magpies\n2.
