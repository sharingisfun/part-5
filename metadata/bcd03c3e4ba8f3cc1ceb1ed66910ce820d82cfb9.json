Other bands, such as the Stooges and the New York Dolls, came before them and set the stage and aesthetic for punk, and bands that immediately followed, such as the Sex Pistols, made the latent violence of the music more explicit, but The Ramones crystallized the musical ideals of the genre. By cutting rock &amp; roll down to its bare essentials -- four chords; a simple, catchy melody; and irresistibly inane lyrics -- and speeding up the tempo considerably, The Ramones created something that was rooted in early '60s, pre-Beatles rock &amp; roll and pop but sounded revolutionary. Since their breakthrough was theoretical as well as musical, they comfortably became the leaders of the emerging New York punk rock scene. While their peers such as Patti Smith, Television, Talking Heads, and Richard Hell all were more intellectual and self-consciously artistic than The Ramones, they nevertheless appealed to the same mentality because of the way they turned rock conventions inside out and celebrated kitschy pop culture with stylized stupidity. The band's first four albums set the blueprint for punk, especially American punk and hardcore, for the next two decades. And The Ramones themselves were major figures for the next two decades, playing essentially the same music without changing their style much at all. Although some punk diehards -- including several of their peers -- would have claimed the band's long career wound up undercutting the ideals the band originally stood for, The Ramones always celebrated not just the punk aesthetic, but the music itself. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.80% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\t8122-70015-2\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Blitzkrieg Bop\n02.Beat On The Brat\n03.Judy Is A Punk\n04.I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\n05.Sheena Is A Punk Rocker (ABC Single Version)\n06.Pinhead\n07.Commando\n08.Rockaway Beach\n09.We're A Happy Family\n10.Cretin Hop\n11.Teenage Lobotomy\n12.I Wanna Be Sedated\n13.I Just Want To Have Something To Do\n14.Rock 'N' Roll High School\n15.Baby, I Love You\n16.Do You Remember Rock 'N' Roll Radio\n17.The KKK Took My Baby Away\n18.Outsider\n19.Pet Sematary\n20.Wart Hog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcd03c3e4ba8f3cc1ceb1ed66910ce820d82cfb9","amp;dn":"Ramones+-+Hey+Ho+Let%27s+Go+Greatest+Hits+%282006%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcd03c3e4ba8f3cc1ceb1ed66910ce820d82cfb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,208,60,62,75,168,243,204,28,235,30,214,105,16,206,130,13,130,207,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
