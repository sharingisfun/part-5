The album's title is a lyric from the song &quot;The End&quot;. The album was released on compact disc for the first time on 19 May 2014 (almost exactly a year after keyboardist Ray Manzarek died). The album was certified Gold by the RIAA. The album cover was designed by Bill Hoffman, with inside band shots by Joel Brodsky.\n\nTwo of the songs on the compilation, &quot;Who Scared You&quot; and &quot;(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further,&quot; were originally released as B-sides to 1969's &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; and 1971's &quot;Love Her Madly,&quot; respectively. They were not included on albums until &quot;Who Scared You&quot; appeared in the The Doors: Box Set in 1997 and &quot;(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further&quot; appeared in the 2006 Perception box set.\n\nThe version of &quot;Who Scared You&quot; that was released on the The Doors: Box Set is an edited version, as part of the last verse is omitted. The full length song was released in 1999 on Essential Rarities and later on the 2006 remastered release of The Soft Parade as a bonus track.\n\nThe album was reissued for the first time in over 40 years by Rhino Records, on special amber colored vinyl as part of Record Store Day on 19 April 2014,[2] and as a double CD (for the first time) on 19 May 2014.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dbf25394507b2f75dfd7df37520c2f4c3ce5bd7","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+Weird+Scenes+Inside+The+Gold+Mine+%282014%29+Reissue+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dbf25394507b2f75dfd7df37520c2f4c3ce5bd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,191,37,57,69,7,178,247,93,253,125,243,117,32,194,244,195,206,91,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
