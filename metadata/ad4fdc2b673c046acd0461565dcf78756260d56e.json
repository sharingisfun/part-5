It was recorded as the band recovered from Brian May's marital problems and Freddie Mercury's AIDS diagnosis (which was, though known to the band, not publicised at the time). Recording started in January 1988 and lasted twelve months.\n\nThe album was originally going to be called &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, but three weeks before the release, according to Roger Taylor, they decided to change the name to The Miracle. The striking cover art utilised the Quantel Paintbox, then state of the art image-manipulation technology, to combine photographs of the familiar faces of the four band members into one morphed Gestalt image, in line with their decision to dispense with individual credits and simply present their music as the product of Queen; the back cover went a step further with a seamless regiment of the bands' eyes {Featuring both of Mercury's eyes only}. The album reached No. 1 in the UK, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and No. 24 on the American Billboard 200 chart. The Miracle is estimated to have sold 9.5 million copies. Allmusic would name it as Queen's best album of the 1980s, along with The Game.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Party&quot;   \tJohn Deacon, Brian May, Freddie Mercury \t2:24\n02. \t&quot;Khashoggi's Ship&quot;   \tQueen \t2:47\n03. \t&quot;The Miracle&quot;   \tMercury, Deacon \t5:02\n04. \t&quot;I Want It All&quot;   \tMay \t4:40\n05. \t&quot;The Invisible Man&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t3:55\n06. \t&quot;Breakthru&quot;   \tMercury (intro), Taylor \t4:07\n07. \t&quot;Rain Must Fall&quot;   \tDeacon (Music), Mercury (Lyrics) \t4:20\n08. \t&quot;Scandal&quot;   \tMay \t4:42\n09. \t&quot;My Baby Does Me&quot;   \tDeacon, Mercury \t3:22\n10. \t&quot;Was It All Worth It&quot;   \tMercury \t5:45\n\n2011 Bonus EP\n\n01. \t&quot;I Want It All (Single Version)&quot;   \t \n02. \t&quot;The Invisible Man (Early Version with Guide Vocal, August 1988)&quot;   \t \n03. \t&quot;Hang On In There (B-Side)&quot;   \t \n04. \t&quot;Hijack My Heart (B-Side)&quot;   \t \n05. \t&quot;StealinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (B-Side)&quot;   \t \n06. \t&quot;Chinese Torture (Instrumental)&quot;   \t \n07. \t&quot;The Invisible Man (12Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Version)&quot;   \t ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad4fdc2b673c046acd0461565dcf78756260d56e","amp;dn":"Queen+-+The+Miracle+%5Bwith+BONUS+EP%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad4fdc2b673c046acd0461565dcf78756260d56e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,79,220,43,103,60,4,106,205,4,97,86,93,207,120,117,98,96,213,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
