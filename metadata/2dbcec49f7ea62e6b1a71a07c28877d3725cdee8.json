Everyone on the team is supportive but a bit upset with Lt. Laguerta for handing over the case that has affected one of their own. Det. Quinn however doesn't feel Dexter is behaving like a grieving husband should and when Masuka mentions that Dexter was aware of Rita kissing her neighbor, he begins to suspect him. As for Dexter, he's in something of a fog. He can't grieve and even delays telling the children of their mother's death until they return from the Keys with their grandparents.

Astor and Cody want to move back into their house - they're all living temporarily with Debra in what is now a very overcrowded apartment - and when they skip school one day to go there, Dexter realizes something has to be done. Meanwhile, Debra is also a bit fed up with the situation and goes over to Quinn's for a decent night's sleep.

He enlists Debra's help to find a nanny for 10-month old Harrison and finds the perfect candidate. Having childcare in place allows him to focus on getting rid of serial killer Boyd Fowler, the dead animal sanitation worker. His first attempt doesn't quite go as planned. He's also in for a major surprise. Angel Batista's bar fight with a fellow officer who made disparaging remarks about Maria Laguerta takes a life-threatening turn. Brenda enlists the aid of a Spanish-speaking uniformed officer, Cira Manzon, in the beheading case.

He quickly realizes however that the man could not have been one of her attackers. Debra meanwhile continues her investigation into the rash of be-headings which lead the police to what may be the killers first victims. Lt. Laguerta begins to act strangely and staying out late leading Angel Batista to think she may be seeing someone.

There he finds a pick-up truck that has disgorged its contents - several formaldehyde-laden barrels containing the bodies of dead women. Of course the women are Boyd Fowler's victims Dexter had discovered in the swamp some time before. The truck is registered to a celebrity, motivational speaker Jordan Chase, who claims that his truck was stolen. Dexter is more interested in Chase's head of security, Cole Harmon, who fits Lumen's description of one of her attackers. Debra meanwhile is still on the Santa Muerte case and Lt. Laguerta agrees to a sting operation using their new informant, Yasmine Aragon.

Lumen also has to deal with her ex-fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© who suddenly shows up in Miami. At the station, the fallout from the shootings at the night club begins to take its toll. It's pretty obvious that Lt. Laguerta isn't going to take the rap for the botched operation. Debra sees the writing on the wall when Angel Batista tells her he hasn't written his report yet and is still going over what happened.

His life is turned upside down however with the sudden arrival of his step-daughter Astor and her friend Olivia. They're drunk and have lied about where they are. Astor is rebellious, refusing to tell Dexter what she is up to or why she is acting this way. She is also convinced that Lumen is Dexter's new girlfriend. Lumen has a conversation with Olivia that puts the girls escapade in an entirely new light. When the girls disappear from his house, he fears that Chase is on to them and the girls have been kidnapped. Dexter is forced to reveal to his colleagues that he's been seeing Chase and they also learn about Lumen, who Dexter describes as his new tenant. At the station meanwhile, Debra has been assigned to work in the filing room and comes across some startling information about the barrel girl murders.

Laguerta has decided to re-open the barrel girls murder case and assigns a reinstated Debra Morgan and Quinn to arrest Cole Harmon. Of course, they don't know that Dexter has already taken of things. They do find that the men made videos of their attacks. Debra begins putting the pieces together and concludes there is a vigilante killer getting rid of the men who attacked and killed the women. From the blood in the small vial Jordan Chase wears around his neck, Dexter is able to track it to Emily Birch who, to his surprise, is still alive. She's not very cooperative however until Lumen visits her on her own. Emily identifies the fifth man as Alex Tilden and Dexter and Lumen make plans to eliminate him. They don't realize that someone has been watching them.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t\nSeason 5, Episode 11: Hop a Freighter\nOriginal Air Date 5 December 2010\n\nDexter and Lumen are trying to figure out how to get Jordan Chase but he catches on to the fact they have been under video surveillance. He manages to trace the equipment back to Joey Quinn, not realizing that Stan Liddy is behind it all. He and Lumen burglarize Quinn's apartment and find some of the photos of them at the marina. Dexter learns soon enough just who is behind it. Debra meanwhile has pretty well figured out the case and tells her colleagues about her vigilante theory: that the killer is probably the 13th victim who escaped and that she is likely being helped by a man. Lt. Laguerta is dubious however. Jordan Chase has conveniently planned to go to Europe on a speaking tour but not before he lays a trap for Dexter and Lumen.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t\nSeason 5, Episode 12: The Big One\nOriginal Air Date 12 December 2010\n\nDexter barrels towards an inevitable and decisive showdown with his latest nemesis Jordan Chase.
