A rather late-bloomer in the genre, Grove did not record his first solo album until 2000. Prior to that, he had replaced Richard Elliot in the Tower of Power when Elliot decided to pursue a solo career, and he also did session work with various pop acts, most noticeably the Miami girl group ExposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. He has a sax solo on their #1 hit &quot;Seasons Change,&quot; and another on their 1993 hit &quot;I'll Never Get Over You (Getting Over Me).&quot;\n\nGrove adopted the name Euge Groove, which consists of a shortening of his middle name and a very frequent mispronunciation of his last. While initially it was presumed to be coined by fans who saw him perform in Europe, Grove later indicated in an interview on XM Radio during the summer of 2006 that his Mother-in-Law conceived the idea for his stage name.\n\nTitle:\n\n(2000) Euge Groove\n\n(2002) Play Date\n\n(2004) Just Feels Right\n\n(2004) Livin' Large\n\n(2007) Born 2 Groove\n\n(2009) Sunday Morning\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              -\nVirus Free Scan with Kaspersky Anti-VirusÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2010 Up To Date    -\n                                                              -\nSpyware Free Scan with Spy SweeperÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Up To Date                -\n                                                              -\nSpam Free Scan with Kaspersky Open Space SecurityÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Up To Date -\n                                                              -\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContact: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ace981ffc9dedac5cfc9dfece0c5dac982cade&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2ceacd565ec8cf7c4cb7f1848ccec92c9faaac8","amp;dn":"Euge+Groove+Discography+2009+High+Quality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2ceacd565ec8cf7c4cb7f1848ccec92c9faaac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,206,172,213,101,236,140,247,196,203,127,24,72,204,236,146,201,250,170,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
