Meanwhile, people with important ideasÃ¢â‚¬â€œbusiness people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and othersÃ¢â‚¬â€œstruggle to make their ideas Ã¢â‚¬Å“stick.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nWhy do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In Made to Stick, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the Ã¢â‚¬Å“human scale principle,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Velcro Theory of Memory,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and creating Ã¢â‚¬Å“curiosity gaps.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn this indispensable guide, we discover that sticky messages of all kindsÃ¢â‚¬â€œfrom the infamous Ã¢â‚¬Å“kidney theft ringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hoax to a coachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at SonyÃ¢â‚¬â€œdraw their power from the same six traits.\n\nMade to Stick is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures)Ã¢â‚¬â€œthe Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Mother Teresa EffectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideasÃ¢â‚¬â€œand tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.\n \n \n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e12a3e3b9ebbf7bf9d85feddb578f39d235390","amp;dn":"Made+to+Stick+-+Why+some+Ideas+Survive+-+Chip+Heath+%26amp%3B+Dan+He","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e12a3e3b9ebbf7bf9d85feddb578f39d235390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,225,42,62,59,158,187,247,191,157,133,254,221,181,120,243,157,35,83,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
