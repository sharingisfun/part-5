Their goal: to conduct a bold and coordinated set of measurements that should help us better understand how meltwater is transported from the ice sheet and into the sea, and ultimately how much that process will affect sea level rise. Larry Smith from UCLA led a team of hydrologists who conducted 72 straight hours of measurements across a river of meltwater, just upstream from where that river plunged into a moulin, or hole in the ice. Smith and Berkeley researcher Vena Chu also placed drifting science beacons in three tributaries of that river to monitor the water as it moved downstream. A few hours after their deployment all three beacons driften by camp, having accomplished their mission. This footage chronicles the flight from Kangerlussuaq, Greenland by helicopter en route to the main camp, as well as the deployment of the drifting beacons.\r\nProduced by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/86/Arctic-B-Roll-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2785Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 24000/1001 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.50 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 40 mins (total)\r\n * Number Of Parts: 3\r\n * Part Size: 834 MB (total)\r\n * Source: Webrip\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12034","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f20e964bd8c03f846e9c51677e3788c9216f2010","amp;dn":"NASA+Arctic+B-Roll+2of3+Russell+Terminus+720p+x264+AAC+MVGroup.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f20e964bd8c03f846e9c51677e3788c9216f2010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,14,150,75,216,192,63,132,110,156,81,103,126,55,136,201,33,111,32,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
