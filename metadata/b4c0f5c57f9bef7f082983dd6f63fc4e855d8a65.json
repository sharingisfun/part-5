Besides the thousands of outstanding still photographs that are shown, the documentary is conventionally narrated but grounded with substantial interviews of both Helmut himself and many other subjects, friends and critics capturing how and why and who the photographs are, when they are not rooted in his idiosyncratic methods of capturing a moment.\n\nA camera crew follows Helmut Newton, the fashion and ad photographer whose images of tall, blond, big-breasted women are part of the iconography of twentieth-century erotic fantasy. He's on the go from L.A., to Paris, to Monte-Carlo, to Berlin, where he was a youth until he escaped from the Nazis in 1936. We see him on shoots, interviewing models, and discussing his work. It's not art and it's not good taste, he tells students. We meet June, his Australian-born wife, whom he married in 1948. Three actresses talk about working with Newton and how posing is different from acting. A heart attack in 1973 helps Newton re-focus, resulting in more personal photographic projects.\n\nThis is a 2-pass deinterlaced StaxRip encoding of the following DVD rip.  \nThanks to kimbentsen for the original.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4157625/Helmut_Newton__Frames_from_the_Edge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4157625/Helmut_Newton__Frames_from_the_Edge&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!\nNoCarrier\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/nocarrier2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/nocarrier2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===== File Information =====\t\t\t\t\nFile Name:\tFrames from the Edge.avi\t\t\t\t\nDuration:\t1:39:48 \t\t\t\nFile Size:\t852,918,272 bytes\t\t\t\n\n===== Video Information ===== \t\t\t\t\nVideo Codec:\tXviD 1.1.2 Final\t\t\t\nVideo Bitrate:\t1047\t\t\t\t\nQuality (bpp):\t0.108\t\t\t\t\nFPS:\t\t29.970 fps\t\t\nAspect Ratio:\t1.167\t\t\t\t\nDimensions:\t672 x 480\t\t\n\n===== Audio Information ===== \t\t\t\t\nAudio Codec:\t0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\t\t\t\t\nAudio Bitrate:\t79\t\t\t\t\nChannel Count:\t2\t\t\t\n\nVideo information generated by GSpot v2.70a\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4c0f5c57f9bef7f082983dd6f63fc4e855d8a65","amp;dn":"Helmut+Newton+-+Frames+from+the+Edge+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4c0f5c57f9bef7f082983dd6f63fc4e855d8a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,192,245,197,127,155,239,127,8,41,131,221,111,99,252,78,133,93,138,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
