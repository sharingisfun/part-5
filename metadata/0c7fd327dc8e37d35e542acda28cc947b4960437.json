With their simple, straightforward rock &amp; roll, the San Francisco-based group became one of America's most popular pop/rock bands of the mid-'80s. Inspired equally by British pub rock and '60s R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll, the News had a driving, party-hearty spirit that made songs like &quot;Workin' for a Livin',&quot; &quot;I Want a New Drug,&quot; &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll,&quot; &quot;Hip to Be Square,&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love&quot; yuppie anthems. At its core, the group was a working band, and the bandmembers knew how to target their audience, writing odes to nine-to-five jobs and sports. As the decade progressed, Huey Lewis &amp; the News smoothed out their sound to appeal to the aging baby boomers who adopted them, but by the beginning of the '90s, the appeal of their formula had decreased. Nevertheless, the group remained a popular concert attraction, and continued to have radio hits on adult contemporary stations.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\n\n\n\n01.The Heart Of Rock &amp; Roll\n02.I Want A New Drug\n03.The Power Of Love\n04.Jacob's Ladder\n05.Stuck With You\n06.Doing It All For My Baby\n07.If This Is It\n08.Do You Believe In Love\n09.Heart And Soul\n10.Back In Time\n11.Perfect World\n12.I Know What I Like\n13.Trouble In Paradise (Live)\n14.It's Alright\n15.Cruisin'\n16.Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do\n17.Small World\n18.But It's Alright\n19.Hip To Be Square\n20.Couple Days Off\n21.Workin' For A Livin'\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c7fd327dc8e37d35e542acda28cc947b4960437","amp;dn":"Huey+Lewis+%26+The+News+-+Greatest+Hits+%282006%29++vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c7fd327dc8e37d35e542acda28cc947b4960437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,127,211,39,220,142,55,211,94,84,42,205,162,140,201,71,180,150,4,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
