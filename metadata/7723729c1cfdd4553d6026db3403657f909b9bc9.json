A Grammy Award winner who was proficient on both the upright bass and the guitar and as a vocalist, Dixon is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. He is recognized as one of the founders of the Chicago blues sound. He also was an important link between the blues and rock and roll, working with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley in the late 1950s.
