It features the same lucid, straightforward writing, clear drawings, and extensive photographic illustrations that have made its parent book, Fundamentals of Building Construction, a bestseller. Wood light frame construction, the system by which most houses in North America are built, is emphasized. Industrialized systems of construction and alternative residential construction systems are also covered.\n\nThe authors first provide a view of the context within which residential construction takes place, including zoning ordinances, building codes, financing, environmental concerns, and a look at the roles of the various professionals who work to produce housing of all types. Following chapters on materials, the chapters on wood light frame construction examine everything from rough sitework, foundations, and framing to plumbing, heating and cooling, wiring, interior and exterior finishing, and, finally, finish sitework. The final portion of the book on alternative construction systems offers detailed explanations of currently popular options such as timber frame, log, rammed earth, straw bale, insulating concrete form, light-gauge steel frame, and panelized construction.\n\nGenerously illustrated with over 1,000 photographs and drawings, Fundamentals of Residential Construction is an important resource for students of architecture, construction, and carpentry, as well as a necessary reference for practicing architects. --This text refers to an out of prin\n\n\nAbundantly illustrated with more than 1,250 drawings and photographs, including new photorealistic illustrations that bring the text to life, this Third Edition provides authoritative coverage on wood light-frame construction, industrialized systems of construction, insulating concrete forms, light-gauge steel frame, panelized construction, and a new chapter on multifamily construction.
