Instead of calling the police, you decide itâ€™s a better idea to kill everyone â€“ using your faithful knife and the environment. The tactical strategy follows a series of killings at parties through-ought the USA.\r\n\r\nThe developers used to work mostly on casual, family-friendly games - until they participated in a game jam, creating the first prototype for Party Hard. TinyBuild backed up the original developers â€“ Pinokl Games â€“ to create a full version that's now on Steam!\r\n\r\nParty Hard has semi-procedural environments and focus on unique ways of killing people. In the greatest traditions of sneaking games, your main goal is not to get caught, while silently picking off unsuspecting victims one by one. Dancing and blending in during a suspicious situation is key","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67a4a23c0772108ab6826050d7406b7ee5d55f5c","amp;dn":"Party+Hard+v1.1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67a4a23c0772108ab6826050d7406b7ee5d55f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,164,162,60,7,114,16,138,182,130,96,80,215,64,107,126,229,213,95,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
