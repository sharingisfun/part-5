DEA agent Art Keller has been fighting the war on drugs for thirty years in a blood feud against AdÃ¡n Barrera, the head of El FederaciÃ³n, the worldâ€™s most powerful cartel, and the man who brutally murdered Kellerâ€™s partner. Finally putting Barrera away cost Keller dearlyâ€”the woman he loves, the beliefs he cherishes, the life he wants to lead.\r\n\r\nThen Barrera gets out, determined to rebuild the empire that Keller shattered. Unwilling to live in a world with Barrera in it, Keller goes on a ten-year odyssey to take him down. His obsession with justiceâ€”or is it revenge?â€”becomes a ruthless struggle that stretches from the cities, mountains, and deserts of Mexico to Washingtonâ€™s corridors of power to the streets of Berlin and Barcelona. Keller fights his personal battle against the devastated backdrop of Mexicoâ€™s drug war, a conflict of unprecedented scale and viciousness, as cartels vie for power and he comes to the final reckoning with Barreraâ€”and himselfâ€”that he always knew must happen.\r\n\r\nThe Cartel is a story of revenge, honor, and sacrifice, as one man tries to face down the devil without losing his soul. It is the story of the war on drugs and the menâ€”and womenâ€”who wage it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556cc53ccfe03a4ac026a6e7393a62dd85bac5e0","amp;dn":"The+Cartel_+A+Novel+-+Don+Winslow.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556cc53ccfe03a4ac026a6e7393a62dd85bac5e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,108,197,60,207,224,58,74,192,38,166,231,57,58,98,221,133,186,197,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
