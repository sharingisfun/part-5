These works are the mainstay of ceremonial or ritual magick.\n\nThe 6th and 7th books of Moses might be the oldest, since legend claims they were given to Moses thousands of years ago. Until now, there were no good copies of these short works available. The ones I've seen are all but unreadable... the tables and seals too poorly reproduced to be of any value. The copies in this torrent correct that problem.\n\nBarrett's Magus is perhaps the rarest and most influential grimoire available. Many forms of ceremonial magick cite this classic 2 volume work, including the Golden Dawn. It's an excellent reference for students of alchemy, astrology, the kabbalah, and magick in general.\n\nLikewise, The Sacred Book Of Abramelin The Mage, The Lesser Key of Solomon, and the other works included here were chosen because they are the most respected and influential works of their type. These are intended as serious tools for the use of practicing occultists. As such, they are the highest quality, usable books, not mere library filler.\n\n\nThis torrent includes...
