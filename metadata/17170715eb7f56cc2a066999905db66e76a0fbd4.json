Set in 1865, the series centers on the settlement that accompanied the construction of the first transcontinental railroad, referred to as &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; by the company men, surveyors, support workers, laborers, prostitutes, mercenaries and others who make the mobile encampment their home.\n\nA former Confederate soldier, Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) journeys to the Union Pacific Railroad's westward construction of the first transcontinental railroad to seek work and vengeance on the Union soldiers that have killed his wife. Cullen gets hired by the railroad and supervises an all-black &quot;cut crew,&quot; one of which is Elam (Common), to prepare the terrain for track laying. Through conversation, Cullen learns more about his wife's death from railroad foreman Daniel Johnson (Ted Levine), who knows the name of her murderer. But tragedy strikes before this name is given. Thomas &quot;Doc&quot; Durant (Colm Meaney) begins his &quot;mad, noble quest&quot; to expand his Union Pacific Railroad westward in order complete the transcontinental railroad. Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott), accompanies her ailing husband Robert (Robert Moloney) as he surveys the landscape for the Union Pacific. Robert is killed by the Cheyenne natives and Lily must cope with being a widow on foreign soil.
