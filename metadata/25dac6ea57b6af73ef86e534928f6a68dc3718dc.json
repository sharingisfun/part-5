They would return to their tour bus after shows to play with it\nduring their 2006 tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as it quickly \nbecame the band&amp;#039;s post-show ritual. Dubbed &quot;The Soothsayer&quot;, the board \nrevealed stories, gave names and made demands, as the band was \ncontacted by three different people who appeared in the form of one, \nwhom was then referred to as &quot;Goliath&quot;. The more the band had \ninteracted with &quot;The Soothsayer&quot;, otherworldly coincidences began \nplaguing the band&amp;#039;s experience writing and recording The Bedlam in \nGoliath: Deantoni Parks--their current drummer at the time--had quit \nmid-tour and left the band with financial troubles; Bixler-Zavala wound \nup needing surgery performed on his foot due to the shoes he had been \nwearing, forcing him to relearn how to walk post-surgery; audio tracks \nsporadically and literally disappeared off the screens; Rodriguez-\nLopez&amp;#039;s home studio flooded and had been subject to multiple power \noutages; and the album&amp;#039;s original engineer had gone through a nervous \nbreakdown, leaving behind all previous work with no notes as to where \nanything was. Rodriguez-Lopez was nearly on the brink of starting over \nfrom scratch, but instead kept on with the recruitment of Robert \nCarranza as the replacement engineer, along with assistance from Lars \nStalfors and Isaiah Abolin. Midway through the recording sessions, \nRodriguez-Lopez buried &quot;The Soothsayer&quot; as an attempt to undo the curse\nand halt the unforeseen tragedies, who ended the ordeal by swearing \nnever to give away the whereabouts of its burial, and also asking the \nband not to speak of it again during the remainder of the album&amp;#039;s \nproduction.\n\nfrom Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia:\n              &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedlam_in_goliath&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedlam_in_goliath&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25dac6ea57b6af73ef86e534928f6a68dc3718dc","amp;dn":"The+Mars+Volta+-+Bedlam+in+Goliath+%5B2008%5D+%5B320kbps%5D+FULL+LEAK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25dac6ea57b6af73ef86e534928f6a68dc3718dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,218,198,234,87,182,175,115,239,134,229,52,146,143,106,104,220,55,24,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
