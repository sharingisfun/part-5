Working from a script by playwright, and experimental filmmaker, Terayama Shuji, Hani's film captures Shun, an orphan, who falls in love with a pretty young nude model named Nanami, with his sexual inadequacies, problem childhood, and coming of age.\n\nExamining Shun, we see the reality of child molestation, with deep scars that ripple into adulthood, exposing the twin monsters of repression and inadequacy looming overhead. Shun's complex relationship with his parents, Nanami, and a young girl named Momi he befriends, eventually lead to disaster, as society closes in, so does fate. Emotionally painful as it is lyrical, Hani has crafted an amazing film that sees into the souls of this young man and woman, and is truly a record of first love.\n\nDesser said that, along with Oshima's The Man Who Left His Will On Film and Yoshida's Eros Plus Massacre, these films &quot;stand as elegies, not only to the new wave of the cinema, but to the era of the '60s in Japan.&quot;\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nDVDrip\n\nVideo\nFormat: AVI\nFile size: 700 MiB\nDuration: 1h 48mn\nOverall bit rate: 903 Kbps\nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile: Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP: Yes\nFormat settings, QPel: No\nFormat settings, GMC: No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix: Custom\nCodec ID: XVID\nBit rate: 801 Kbps\nWidth: 528 pixels\nHeight: 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 4/3\nFrame rate: 23.976 fps\nResolution: 24 bits\nColorimetry: 4:2:0\nScan type: Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.158\n\nAudio\nFormat: MPEG Audio\nFormat version: Version 1\nFormat profile: Layer 3\nCodec ID: 55\nCodec ID/Hint: MP3\nBit rate mode: Variable\nMinimum bit rate: 112 Kbps\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 44.1 KHz\nResolution: 16 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:563544476c022dbb42b7d61c83ca5c3a11071b5e","amp;dn":"Nanami%3A+The+Inferno+of+First+Love+%28Hatsukoi%3A+Jigoku-hen%2C+1968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"563544476c022dbb42b7d61c83ca5c3a11071b5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,53,68,71,108,2,45,187,66,183,214,28,131,202,92,58,17,7,27,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
