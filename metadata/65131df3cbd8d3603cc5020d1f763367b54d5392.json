The script by Gary Ross (Dave) and Anne Spielberg finds some unexpected ways of attacking obvious issues of sex, work, and childhood friendships, and in all of these things the accent is on classy humor and great sensitivity. Hanks is remarkable in the lead, at times hilarious (reacting to caviar just as a 12-year-old would) and at others deeply tender. Penny Marshall became a first-rate filmmaker with this 1988 work.\n\n\n\nFormat            : Matroska at 2,644 Kbps\nLength            : 2 GiB for 1h 44mn 9s 785ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65131df3cbd8d3603cc5020d1f763367b54d5392","amp;dn":"Big+%28Tom+Hanks%29+1988+-+720p+HDTV+AAC%2Fh264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65131df3cbd8d3603cc5020d1f763367b54d5392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,19,29,243,203,216,211,96,60,197,2,13,31,118,51,103,181,77,83,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
