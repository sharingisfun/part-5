Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant. She is an important and powerful new voice.\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca9acbd21497b277f912c5946765ebc0f1d50589","amp;dn":"%5BPulitzer%5D+The+Interpreter+of+Maladies+by+Jhumpa+Lahiri+%28epub%29+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca9acbd21497b277f912c5946765ebc0f1d50589","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,154,203,210,20,151,178,119,249,18,197,148,103,101,235,192,241,213,5,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
