Award-winning director and producer Steph Atkinson asks how did America get here, and if the fears between these different groups are justified.\r\nIn Irving, Texas, the city's growing Muslim community is under fire from right-wing hate groups who seek to marginalise and intimidate them. BBC Three meets two anti-Islamist groups - Bomb Islam and BAIR (Bureau for American Islamic Relations) - one of the most extreme anti-Muslim groups in America who believe all Muslims are potential terrorists, as they organise various protests outside mosques at the same time as groups such as Nation of Islam gather to meet them head on.\r\nWe meet Muslims living and working in Texas who tell us of their experiences when hate is at an all-time high. We also meet Imam Omar Suleiman to understand how he feels about the protests outside his mosque in Texas. Atkinson also makes contact with a Muslim living in Texas who holds the extreme views - which many fear - that Jihad and Sharia law is the way forward for all of America and beyond.\r\nWith such growing Islamophobia this programme explores what lies behind the tensions and whether these different groups of people can ever come together to see each other's point of view.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2e/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d9/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/72/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/United-States-of-Hate-Muslims-under-Attack-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~2993 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 56mins\r\n * Framerate: 25fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.22 GB\r\n * Source: WebRip\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/21/united-states-of-hate\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Islam%20and%20the%20West \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Islam%3A%20The%20Untold%20Story \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=After%20Paris%3A%20The%20Battle%20for%20British%20Islam \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Wham%20Bam%20Islam \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Science%20and%20Islam","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:555dff524e6d1dfbdefddcb8bbbc16f5673f82dc","amp;dn":"BBC+United+States+of+Hate+Muslims+Under+Attack+720p+x264+AAC+MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"555dff524e6d1dfbdefddcb8bbbc16f5673f82dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,93,255,82,78,109,29,251,222,253,220,184,187,188,22,245,103,63,130,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
