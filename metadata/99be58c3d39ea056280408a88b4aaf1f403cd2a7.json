The plotline is carried by John McGuire, playing Ward, a newspaper reporter whose courtroom testimony sends the hapless Briggs (Elisha Cook Jr). to the death house. Ward is certain that he saw Briggs leaving the scene of a murder, but as the days pass, he is tortured by guilt and doubt -- especially during the film's surrealistic knockout of a nightmare sequence. When another murder is committed, Ward finds himself as much a victim of circumstantial evidence as the unfortunate Briggs. The reporter's girlfriend (Margaret Tallichet) tries to clear Ward....and that's when she first makes the acquaintance of Lorre, who is heard ordering a pound of raw meat! Stranger on the Third Floor  was a &quot;film noir&quot; long prior to the genesis of that cinematic movement. Long ignored or trivialized by film historians, this 7-reel quickie has in recent years graduated to classic status. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033107/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033107/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3153749/stranger-on-the-third-floor-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3153749/stranger-on-the-third-floor-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:03:24\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x544 4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1993 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,22 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99be58c3d39ea056280408a88b4aaf1f403cd2a7","amp;dn":"Stranger+on+the+Third+Floor+%281940%29+Peter+Lorre+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99be58c3d39ea056280408a88b4aaf1f403cd2a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,190,88,195,211,158,160,86,40,4,8,168,139,74,175,31,64,60,210,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
