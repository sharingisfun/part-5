The high technical level of their compositions usually makes people refer to their style as somewhat of a progressive metal or progressive rock band.\nFreak Kitchen's style of music is influenced by many genres besides the traditional heavy metal, ranging from jazz to pop. The band described their third album as &quot;A corny little heavy-pop-rock-latin-world-jazz-avant-garde-metal-blues-record&quot;.\nLyrics contain heavy criticism against capitalist society, conformity, racism and the attitude of huge record companies.\n\n\nAlbums in torrent:\n\n1994 Appetizer\n1996 Spanking hour\n1998 Freak kitchen\n1999 Junk tooth(EP)\n2000 Dead soul men\n2002 Move\n2005 Organic(promo)\n\nCurrent line-up \nMattias IA Eklundh - Vocals, guitar (Planet Alliance, Frozen Eyes, Freak Guitar Mattias IA Eklundh, Fate (Dnk), Art Metal, Audiovision)\nChrister ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œrtefors - Bass\nBjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Fryklundh - Drums (Full Strike) \nFormer/past member(s) \nJoakim SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶berg (aka Enwin Redin) - Drums (1994-2000) (Frozen Eyes) \nChristian GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nlund - Bass (1994-2000) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef27b0816ad06964f71c43c8e5bda703c25dd0e6","amp;dn":"Freak+Kitchen+-+Discography+%281994-2005%29+%5Bmp3%40256%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef27b0816ad06964f71c43c8e5bda703c25dd0e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,39,176,129,106,208,105,100,247,28,67,200,229,189,167,3,194,93,208,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
