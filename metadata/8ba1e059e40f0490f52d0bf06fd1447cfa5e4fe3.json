Jacques Delarue, a saboteur arrested by the Nazis in occupied France, chronicles how the land of Beethoven elevated sadism to a fine art. The Gestapo: A History of Horror draws upon Delarue's interviews with ex-Gestapo agents to deliver a multi-layered history of the force whose work included killing student resisters, establishing Aryan eugenic unions, and implementing the Final Solution. This is a probing look at the Gestapo and the fanatics and megalomaniacs who made it such a successful and heinous organizationÃ¢â‚¬â€Barbie, Eichmann, Himmler, Heydrich, MÃƒÂ¼ller. The Gestapo's notorious reign led to the murder of millions. The Gestapo is an important documentation of what they did and how they did it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ba1e059e40f0490f52d0bf06fd1447cfa5e4fe3","amp;dn":"The+Gestapo%3A+A+History+of+Horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ba1e059e40f0490f52d0bf06fd1447cfa5e4fe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,161,224,89,228,15,4,144,245,45,11,240,111,209,68,124,250,94,79,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
