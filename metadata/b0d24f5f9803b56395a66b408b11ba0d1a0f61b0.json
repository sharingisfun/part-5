Sweet Annie\n\nGreatest Hits So Far has a simple title and a simple execution: it rounds up the 14 singles the Zac Brown Band released between 2008 and 2013, presenting them in chronological order and containing no bonus material. There are a lot of hits here -- &quot;Chicken Fried,&quot; &quot;Toes,&quot; &quot;Highway 20 Ride,&quot; &quot;Free,&quot; &quot;As She's Walking Away,&quot; &quot;Colder Weather,&quot; &quot;Knee Deep,&quot; and &quot;Keep Me in Mind&quot; all hit number one on Billboard's country charts, and most of the rest made it into the Top 10 -- and when they're combined in a collection, the overall effect is to push ZBB away from their (deserved) jam band associations and into the realm of sturdy craftsmen. Brown and his chief co-writer Wyatt Durette have a knack for full-blooded yet sensitive melodies reminiscent of the golden age of singer/songwriters, with many of the best songs (&quot;Colder Weather,&quot; &quot;As She's Walking Away&quot;) bearing an uncanny (and possibly unintended) similarity to the terrific and obscure songsmith B.W. Stevenson, along with James Taylor. This means Greatest Hits So Far underscores the band's timeless qualities: in addition to being a great live band, they're a hell of a singles band, too, creating songs that withstand hundreds of plays","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0d24f5f9803b56395a66b408b11ba0d1a0f61b0","amp;dn":"Zac+Brown+Band+-+Greatest+Hits+So+Far...+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0d24f5f9803b56395a66b408b11ba0d1a0f61b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,210,79,95,152,3,181,99,149,166,107,64,139,17,186,13,26,15,97,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
