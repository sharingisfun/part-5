Thanx.\n\n\nAbout:\n__\n\nThis collection of 100 of O Henry's finest stories is a showcase for the sheer variety of one of America's best and best-loved short story writers. The variety of the stories is amazing; O Henry is as at home describing life south of the Rio Grande as he is chronicling the activities and concerns of 'the four million' ordinary citizens who inhabited turn-of-the-century New York. They are marked by coincidence and surprise endings as well as the compassion and high humor that have made O Henry's stories popular for the last century.\n\nPaperback: 735 pages\nPublisher: Wordsworth Editions Ltd; New edition\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1853262412\nISBN-13: 978-1853262418\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents. ;)\n_______________________________\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&lt;/a&gt;\n_______________________________\t\t\n\t\t\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n\n                                                      (:__Abee \t\n\ntags:\n\nhenry,o,classics,selected,short,story,american,best,heart,breaking,all,time,fiction,book,ebook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:074b6ab988d19c3394104c91033fdf8f05c2d239","amp;dn":"O+Henry+-+100+Selected+Stories+%28Wordsworth+Classics%29+-+Abee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"074b6ab988d19c3394104c91033fdf8f05c2d239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,75,106,185,136,209,156,51,148,16,76,145,3,63,223,143,5,194,210,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
