It also marks Courtney's first record since her solo album America's Sweetheart of 2004 (with &quot;Mono&quot; and &quot;Hold On To Me,&quot; both songs co-written with Linda Perry, who co-wrote the bulk of that album's songs with Courtney). \n\n&quot;This record is about greed, vengeance and feminism,&quot; says Courtney Love of the ragged rock songs on her first LP in six years - and the first she'll release with a new incarnation of Hole. Writing began in 2005, while Love was strumming raw folk tunes on an acoustic during a rehab stint. But as the songs developed - with help from producer Michael Beinhorn, Billy Corgan and Linda Perry - Love says, &quot;S**t got darker, I got meaner, and the tracks got hard and big.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54c52e56a4031fcfd586892c491247b3a1ccb6a4","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Nobody%5C%27s+Daughter+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54c52e56a4031fcfd586892c491247b3a1ccb6a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,197,46,86,164,3,31,207,213,134,137,44,73,18,71,179,161,204,182,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
