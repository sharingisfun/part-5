Taking inspiration for the project's name from a cabin in Ontario where Kirk made some of his first recordings, Timber Timbre released two albums, 2006's Cedar Shakes and the following year's Medicinals, independently before signing to the Canadian imprint Arts &amp; Crafts. The label released Timber Timbre's self-titled album, which made the Polaris Prize long list, in 2009. Kirk and company spent much of 2010 touring with artists such as JÃƒÂ³nsi and the Low Anthem, and also performed at that yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Calgary Folk Festival and Vancouver Folk Fest. Timber Timbre returned with their fourth album, Creep on Creepin' On, in early 2011, which found its way onto the short list for the Polaris Prize. They toured throughout much of 2012 and supported Laura Marling for a string of U.K. dates, and then fellow countrywoman Feist on her tour of America. In 2013 they returned to the studio to lay tracks down for their fifth record, Hot Dreams, which was set for release in 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e19c2a12a2a93000016496f55af6cf53add17ea","amp;dn":"Timber+Timbre+-+Hot+Dreams+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e19c2a12a2a93000016496f55af6cf53add17ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,25,194,161,42,42,147,0,0,22,73,111,85,175,108,245,58,221,23,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
