Epic Comics imported, translated and published a great deal of his work during the imprint's lifespan. This torrent contains, to the best of my knowledge, all of that work, PLUS a couple of limited series set in the 'Airtight Garage' universe in which Moebius provided the writing or plot, with art chores handled by others (Eric Shanower, for one). While a lot of these volumes are available and well-seeded on TPB, they are often one-book torrents, which requires multiple torrents and downloads in order to accumulate a collection. As part of my (almost completed, yay!) epic Comics Upload-Quest, the heavy-lifting has already been done for you here.\n\nHere's a list of books contained here that I do NOT see elsewhere on TPB: 'Chaos', 'Metallic Memories', several 'Blueberry' books and the two 'Airtight Garage' sandbox mini-series, 'Elsewhere Prince' and 'Onyx Overlord'.\n\nThank you Moebius, thank you creative teams and thank you scanners. Get it, pass it on.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd54cf990af679e1223b1d9200389c5e5366ad0","amp;dn":"Collected+%28and+corrected%29+Moebius+from+epic+Comics+imprint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd54cf990af679e1223b1d9200389c5e5366ad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,213,76,249,144,175,103,158,18,35,177,217,32,3,137,197,229,54,106,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
