The other five demigods have to put aside their grief and follow PercyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions to find the mortal side of the Doors of Death. If they can fight their way through the GaeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces, and Percy and Annabeth can survive the House of Hades, then the Seven will be able to seal the Doors both sides and prevent the giants from raising Gaea. But, Leo wonders, if the Doors are sealed, how will Percy and Annabeth be able to escape? \n\nThey have no choice. If the demigods donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t succeed, GaeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armies will never die. They have no time. In about a month, the Romans will march on Camp Half-Blood. The stakes are higher than ever in this adventure that dives into the depths of Tartarus.\n\nnJoy\n\nN@mPr05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f45e7998bffaf6460b8d1f29f5dc07717f1b617","amp;dn":"Rick+Riordan+-+Heroes+of+Olympus+04+-+The+House+of+Hades+%28Mobi+%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f45e7998bffaf6460b8d1f29f5dc07717f1b617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,69,231,153,139,255,175,100,96,184,209,242,159,93,192,119,23,241,182,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
