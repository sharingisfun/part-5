Instead of grabbing a quick snack on your way out the door or eating just to calm down at the end of a stressful day, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it about time you let yourself truly appreciate a satisfying, nourishing meal?\n\nIn our modern society, weight concerns, obesity rates, and obsession with appearance have changed the way we look at foodÃ¢â‚¬â€and not necessarily for the better. If you have ever snacked when you werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hungry, have used guilt as a guide for your eating habits, or have cut calories even when you felt hungry, you have experienced Ã¢â‚¬Å“mindlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ eating firsthand. This mindless approach to food is dangerous, and can have serious health and emotional consequences. But if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been mindlessly eating all your life, it can be difficult to make a change. When it comes down to it, you must take a whole new approach to eatingÃ¢â‚¬â€but where do you begin? Practicing mindful eating habits may be just the thing to make that important change. In fact, it might just be the answer youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been searching for all these years.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0940e1ce0df7563e46769f4cbcafc0ba9f1183","amp;dn":"Eating+Mindfully%3A+How+to+End+Mindless+Eating","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0940e1ce0df7563e46769f4cbcafc0ba9f1183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,9,64,225,206,13,247,86,62,70,118,159,76,188,175,192,186,159,17,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
