By the end of the century, however, it had transformed itself into a major player in world finance, building an international banking empire worth twelve times its GDP. The tiny island nation of 300,000 was one of the global economyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great success stories.\n\nAnd then everything came crashing down.\n\nWhy Iceland? is the inside account of one of the economic meltdownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most fascinating and far-reaching tragedies. As Chief Economist of Kaupthing Bank, the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest bank before the collapse, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½sgeir JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nsson is perfectly suited to examine IcelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collapse in painstaking detail. He witnessed behind-the-scenes events firsthand, such as an intriguing meeting in January 2008 when a group of international hedge fund managers gathered in a bar in Reykjavik to discuss IcelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s economyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an informal affair that eventually became the center of a criminal investigation by the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Financial Supervisory Authority.\n\nThis inside account examines the pressing issues behind historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest banking collapse:\n\n    * How did Iceland transform itself from one of EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s poorest to one of its wealthiest countries?\n    * What happened to cause the destruction of the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s banking industry during a single week of October 2008?\n    * Was it the result of a speculation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œattackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by hedge funds on the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s currency?\n\nIceland remains the biggest casualty of the economic downturn, and the ramifications of its catastrophic failure reach deeply into the economies of Europe, the United States, and other global markets. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½sgeir JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nsson offers a unique perspective and an expertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s insight into the rise and fall of this once-proud banking giant.\n\nWhy Iceland? provides the who, what, where, and when of IcelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s demise, serving as a fascinating read and providing the understanding necessary for forecasting when and where the aftershocks will shake up markets in other parts of the world.\n\n&quot;Fearsome Vikings discovered Iceland. Hedge funds knocked it down. It was a humiliating tumble for the former financial powerhouse, which was proud of its status in Europe. A late bloomer, Iceland had been the last country in Europe to be settled, the Nordic nation rapidly caught up with its wealthier relations. It was all fine until October 2008, when country's banking system collapsed in a week. Written by an Icelandic economist, Why Iceland? chronicles the meltdown, in the context of the nation's history.&quot;--New York Post (A &quot;Required Reading&quot; Selection) (20090816) \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Why-Iceland-Smallest-Countries-Meltdowns/dp/0071632840/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301888722&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Why-Iceland-Smallest-Countries-Meltdowns/dp/0071632840/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301888722&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d605a4420110f8d9938fca8e2a231be5678b99","amp;dn":"Why+Iceland%3F%3A+How+One+of+the+World%5C%27s+Smallest+Countries+Became+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d605a4420110f8d9938fca8e2a231be5678b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,214,5,164,66,1,16,248,217,147,143,202,142,42,35,27,229,103,139,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
