She is best known for OUT OF AFRICA (1937), her lyrical memoir of living in Kenya, and one of her stories, BABETTE'S FEAST (1953), about a chef who spends her entire 10,000-franc lottery prize to prepare a final, spectacular gourmet meal.  Both works were adapted into acclaimed Academy Award-winning motion pictures.\n\nDinesen's tales follow a traditional style of storytelling, and most take place against the background of the 19th century or earlier periods.  Concerning her deliberately old-fashioned style, she mentioned in several interviews that she wanted to express a spirit that no longer existed in modern times, that of destiny and courage.\n\nShe was awarded the Danish Ingenio et Arti medal in 1950.  Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, described it as &quot;a mistake&quot; that Blixen was not awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature during the 1930s.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* BABETTE'S FEAST (Penguin, 2001)\n\n* LAST TALES (Vintage, 1991)\n\n* OUT OF AFRICA (Random House, 2002)\n\n* OUT OF AFRICA / SHADOWS ON THE GRASS (Vintage, 1989)\n\n* SEVEN GOTHIC TALES (Vintage, 1991)\n\n* WINTER'S TALES (Vintage, 1993)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
