It's got all the great 80's Metal bands set loose to belt out their favorite tunes. A great way to see another side of these guys and to get a feel for what influenced them when they were young and aspiring Headbangers. Some of their picks surprised me. I HAD to buy this so I could have every recording by OZZY. (I even have his funky &quot;Shake Your Head&quot; with Was (not Was) and his duet with Miss Piggy on &quot;Kermit Unpigged&quot;.) His choice of &quot;Purple Haze&quot; on this CD was interesting. He nailed it as only Ozzy could. By the way, the correct title is, &quot;Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell&quot;. Every Headbanger should have it!\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n VA - Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell\nGenre................: Heavy Metal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 265kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
