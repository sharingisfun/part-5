A collective band comprised of virtuosic instrumentalists. One shared goal. \nAnd one tremendous album, commonly referred to as the equivalent of aural nirvana. Still the only \nmeeting of Santana and John McLaughlin, Love Devotion Surrender more than lives up to the promise \noffered by its principal creators as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a spiritual journey based in divine faith, religious \ntoleration, and the forward-thinking philosophy that music can take us closer to the truth. These \nenlightening concepts are reflected in the playing of Santana and McLaughlin, who repeatedly hit a \nhigher plane on this stunning 1973 set.\n\n\n   1.
