Dubner, coauthor of Freakonomics\n\nWhen first-year graduate student Sudhir Venkatesh walked into an abandoned building \n\nin one of ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most notorious housing projects, he hoped to find a few people \n\nwilling to take a multiple-choice survey on urban poverty--and impress his professors \n\nwith his boldness. He never imagined that as a result of this assignment he would \n\nbefriend a gang leader named JT and spend the better part of a decade embedded inside \n\nthe projects under JTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protection. From a privileged position of unprecedented \n\naccess, Venkatesh observed JT and the rest of his gang as they operated their crack-\n\nselling business, made peace with their neighbors, evaded the law, and rose up or \n\nfell within the ranks of the gangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complex hierarchical structure. Examining the \n\nmorally ambiguous, highly intricate, and often corrupt struggle to survive in an \n\nurban war zone, Gang Leader for a Day also tells the story of the complicated \n\nfriendship that develops between Venkatesh and JT--two young and ambitious men a \n\nuniverse apart.\n\n&quot;Riveting.&quot; --The New York Times\n\n&quot;Compelling... dramatic...
