Unfortunately, its 2:44 long.  The PCM audio track was just way to big to include.  It takes up about 1/3 of a DVD5.  The DD 5.1 track was transcoded from 448 kb/sec to 384 kb/sec to give as much space as possible to the video.\nAverage bitrate for the whole DVD is 3318 kb/sec.  Chapters are in their proper places. This was packed with WinRar 3.60.\n\nRipped: Menus, all audio tracks except DD 5.1, subtitles\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afc8c85bd41ff7d6735d36f21dfa1769b1be02b1","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+Score%3A+20th+Anniversary+World+Tour+Live+with+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afc8c85bd41ff7d6735d36f21dfa1769b1be02b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,200,200,91,212,31,247,214,115,93,54,242,29,250,23,105,177,190,2,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
