These applets allow you to have a much richer experience online than simply interacting with static HTML pages.\n\nJava Plug-in technology, included as part of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (JRE), establishes a connection between popular browsers and the Java platform. Java allows applications to be downloaded over a network and run within a guarded sandbox. Security restrictions are easily imposed on the sandbox.\n\nMany cross platform applications also require Java to operate properly.\n\nTitle: Java Runtime Environment 1.6.0.23\n\nRequirements: Windows 2000 / XP / 2003 / Vista / Windows7\n\nLanguages: en-US\n\nLicense: Freeware\n\nAuthor: Sun Microsystems\n\nTesting\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3366e89486aca37aa45ecfa27bdbc074fba7080d","amp;dn":"Java+Runtime+Environment+v1.6.0.23.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3366e89486aca37aa45ecfa27bdbc074fba7080d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,102,232,148,134,172,163,122,164,94,207,162,123,219,192,116,251,167,8,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
