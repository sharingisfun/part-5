His first version of the piece included only a chamber orchestra with lower strings, harp, timpani, and organ. Four years later, FaurÃƒÂ© added two movements and slightly expanded the orchestration. This is the version that Rutter and his inimitable Cambridge Singers perform here-- and it&amp;#039;s a glorious revelation, especially if the only FaurÃƒÂ© Requiem you&amp;#039;ve heard is that for full orchestra, which the composer himself neither created nor approved. Rutter and his singers give us a wonderfully sumptuous yet detailed performance that benefits tremendously from the newly realized clarity of inner lines and from the richly colored orchestral textures\n\nOn this Cd:\n1.Requiem, for 2 solo voices, chorus, organ &amp; orchestra, Op. 48 \nComposed by Gabriel Faure \nPerformed by London Sinfonia [members of] \nwith Caroline Ashton, Stephen Varcoe, Simon Standage, John Scott, Cambridge Singers \nConducted by John Rutter \n\n\n2.
