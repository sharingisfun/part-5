T.J. wants the car back from the salvage yard where the owner's son is a bully. By happenstance, Hesher, a foul-mouthed squatter, moves in with T.J's family. T.J. also meets Nicole, a grocery clerk near poverty who helps him once. Hesher involves T.J. in crime, the bully is omnipresent, mom's car is slipping away, dad has checked out, T.J. watches Nicole at work, and his grandma invites him to join her morning walk: the odds are long that T.J. can assemble a family to help him thrive.                \n\nYear: 2010                \nDirector: Spencer Susser                \nWriters: Spencer Susser, David MichÃ´d, Brian Charles Frank                \nStars: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Devin Brochu, Rainn Wilson, Piper Laurie, Natalie Portman, Brendan Hill, John Carroll Lynch, Monica Staggs, Mary Elizabeth Barrett, Audrey Wasilewski                \nGenres: Drama                \nLanguage: English                \n\nRELEASE.....................: Hesher.2010.720p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\nVIDEO.......................: 1000 kbps  \nCODEC.......................: x264\nRESOLUTION..................: 1280x532                \nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\nAUDIO.......................: 2 Channel / AC3 / 192kbps                \nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 855MB / MP4\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPoster: \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/hesher/2010/hesher-2010-poster.jpg               \n\nWarning!!!
