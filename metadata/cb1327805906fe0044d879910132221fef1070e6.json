Cutting-edge research shows that no single diet works well for everyone - the very same foods that keep your best friend slim may keep you overweight and feeling unhealthy and fatigued. Now, William Wolcott, a pioneer in the field of metabolic research, has developed a revolutionary weight-loss program that allows you to identify your &quot;metabolic type&quot; and create a diet that suits your individual nutritional needs.\n\nIn The Metabolic Typing Diet, Wolcott and acclaimed science writer Trish Fahey provide simple self-tests that you can use to discover your own metabolic type and determine what kind of diet will work best for you. It might be a low-fat, high carbohydrate diet filled with pasta and grains, or a high-fat, high-protein diet focused on meat and seafood, or anything in between. By detailing exactly which foods and food combinations are right for you, The Metabolic Typing Diet at last reveals the secret to shedding unwanted pounds and achieving optimum vitality with lasting results.\n\nThe Metabolic Typing Diet will enable you to:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Achieve and maintain your ideal weight\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Eliminate sugar cravings\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Enjoy sustained energy and endurance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Conquer indigestion, fatigue, and allergies\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Bolster your immune system\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Overcome anxiety, depression, and mood swings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb1327805906fe0044d879910132221fef1070e6","amp;dn":"The+Metabolic+Typing+Diet+%28William+L.+Wolcott+and+Trish+Fahey%29+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb1327805906fe0044d879910132221fef1070e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,19,39,128,89,6,254,0,68,216,121,145,1,50,34,31,239,16,112,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
