The VHS I got from a friend, who can't remember ever playing it, so it's ideal for digital transfer. This little &quot;concert&quot; was never released officially on DVD.\n\nJohn Cale and Lou Reed teamed up to write and perform this series of songs about the late Andy Warhol.  Easily one of the best projects either one has been involved with, including their famous work with the Velvet Underground. Emotionally and intellectually affecting.\n\n\nResolution: 640x480\nLanguage: English\nAudio: HE-AAC\n\nTRACK LIST\nSmalltown\nOpen House\nStyle It Takes\nWork\nTrouble with Classicists\nStarlight\nFaces and Names\nImages\nSlip Away (A Warning)\nIt Wasn't Me\nI Believe\nNobody But You\nA Dream\nForever Changed\nHello It's Me\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17289e2dd3841ef98355d7449f939bea5e88a21b","amp;dn":"Lou+Reed+%2B+John+Cale+-+Songs+for+Drella+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17289e2dd3841ef98355d7449f939bea5e88a21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,40,158,45,211,132,30,249,131,85,215,68,159,147,155,234,94,136,162,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
