Some bands have `em, most don't. Austin-based five-piece\nScorpion Child have `em in spades. Whether it's an extended blues jam or a\nshort slice of bombastic heavy rock The Child lay a hook so tasty everyone\nbites. Scorpion Child come from lots of different places, not only\nlogistically but musically. Their sound heralds back to early 70's kraut and\npsych-rock with a modern twist and lists Pentagram, Hairy Chapter and\nLucifer's Friend as influences. They originally formed in 2006 and have\nspent the last few years perfecting both their songwriting and stage\npresence. Aryn Jonathan Black fronts the outfit with a siren-like voice\nreminiscent of a young Robert Plant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69f90230f4b0ea3b402d45ebebc5e65ad00ebf7f","amp;dn":"Scorpion_Child-Scorpion_Child-2013-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69f90230f4b0ea3b402d45ebebc5e65ad00ebf7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,249,2,48,244,176,234,59,64,45,69,235,235,197,230,90,208,14,191,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
