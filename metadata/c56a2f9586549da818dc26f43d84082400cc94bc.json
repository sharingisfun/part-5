This is her first pregnancy and she is full term. She is in a lot of pain, her liquor is stained with meconium and the trace of her baby's heart is classified as pathological. Her grasp of English is limited. You have been asked to obtain her consent for a caesarean sectionâ€¦\r\n\r\n100 Cases in Clinical Ethics and Law explores legal and ethical dilemmas through 100 clinical scenarios typical of those encountered by medical students and junior doctors in the emergency or outpatient department, on the ward or in the community setting. Covering issues such as consent, capacity, withdrawal of treatment, confidentiality and whistle-blowing, each scenario has a practical problem-solving element, encouraging readers to explore their own beliefs and values including those that arise as a result of differing cultural and religious backgrounds. Answer pages highlight key points in each case, providing advice on how to deal with the emotive issues that occur when practicing medicine and guidance on appropriate behavior.\r\n\r\nMaking speedy and appropriate decisions, and choosing the best course of action to take as a result, is one of the most important and challenging parts of training to become a doctor. These true-to-life cases will teach students and junior doctors to recognize ethical and legal dilemmas as they arise, and to respond appropriately","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56a2f9586549da818dc26f43d84082400cc94bc","amp;dn":"100+Cases+in+Clinical+Ethics+and+Law+-+2nd+Ed+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56a2f9586549da818dc26f43d84082400cc94bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,106,47,149,134,84,157,168,24,220,38,244,61,132,8,36,0,204,148,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
