She is the author of seven novels, including Adam Bede (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860), Silas Marner (1861), Middlemarch (1871Ã¢â‚¬â€œ72), and Daniel Deronda (1876), most of them set in provincial England and known for their realism and psychological insight.\n\nShe used a male pen name, she said, to ensure her works would be taken seriously. Female authors were published under their own names during Eliot's life, but she wanted to escape the stereotype of women only writing lighthearted romances. An additional factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny and to prevent scandals attending her relationship with the married George Henry Lewes, with whom she lived for over 20 years.\n\nHer 1872 work, Middlemarch, has been described as the greatest novel in the English language by Martin Amis and by Julian Barnes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a931640cde75fc782c2f1744c2f73165e08f1e0","amp;dn":"George+Eliot+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a931640cde75fc782c2f1744c2f73165e08f1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,147,22,64,205,231,95,199,130,194,241,116,76,47,115,22,94,8,241,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
