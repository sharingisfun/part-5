And I would allow the viewer to decide which of those moments are in each production.  There are more than enough of them for me to to make these files and keep them seeded for the world torrent community.  Here is the directorial debut for the Globe by Eve Best.  Early on in these films she starred with Charles Edwards in Much Ado About Nothing.It is also the debut for the screen director Sue Judd at the Globe.  And you will see Samantha Spiro who played Catarina in the Globe's Taming Of The Shrew&quot; as well.  But as these are ensembles, some of the Globe regulars such as Philip Cumbus who should be stars in their own right also appear.\n\n  The original dvd's with original sound are available from online markets and from the Globe Theatre itself.  Here you will note the files are marked LEV at the end.  I use a software program to make the sound of drums and battles at a level similar to the voice.\n\n  Please have your libraries acquire the originals.  Many include subtitles for German and French and perhaps other members of the file share community will make subtitle editions available for their respective languages.\n\nNotes Written November 22, 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a2a1b437bda2d8f9db8ed8a4a35b536230a37cf","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+On+Screen+Macbeth+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a2a1b437bda2d8f9db8ed8a4a35b536230a37cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,42,27,67,123,218,45,143,157,184,237,138,74,53,181,54,35,10,55,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
