VariCAD is sold &quot;fully loaded&quot;, including all features and functions, for one affordable price. The system contains:\n\n3D Modeling\n2D Drawing and Editing\nOptional Support of Parameters\nOptional Support of Geometrical Constraints\nShells Modeling, Pipelines, Wires\nCrash Tests (Interferences)\n3D Assemblies and Groups\nSurface Development (Sheet Metal Unbending)\nMechanical Part Libraries and Symbol Libraries\nCalculations of 3D Objects or 2D Sections\nBOM and Title Blocks\n\nChanges:\n\n(VariCAD 2013-2.01- March 22, 2013)\n\nMore information:\n\nSupport of multi-level assemblies\nYou can define a sub-assembly created from multiple objects. It is similar as a definition of single part. The sub-assembly can be further inserted into assemblies, where it behaves as a single object. A sub-assembly itself can contain also inserted parts or other sub-assemblies, so you can create a complex structure of mechanical design.\n\nSupport of relative paths in assembly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sub-assembly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ part links\nOptionally, it is possible to use relative paths. This allows you to maintain situation, where various computers have access to server, and the access is mapped differently. Or, if some computers work under Windows and some computers work under Linux. All users can now access common data at server without problems. Another advantage may be in exchanging of files between different users - if these files are only copied as directory structures.\n\nChanges in BOM, allowing you to select various possibilities of data processing, if 3D contains multi-level assembly\nIf 3D contains sub-assemblies, a BOM can be created by various methods. You can select whether to create a BOM from highest level only (as it was previously), or if to process complete structure of all levels of inserted parts and sub-assemblies. If a BOM is created at one single level, you can select creation from highest level only or from all parts from all levels. Then, you can obtain complete list of all parts necessary for completion of the highest assembly.\n\nChanges in definition and maintenance of solid attributes, if 3D contains multi-level assembly\nChanges in geometrical constraints in 3D, especially more legible listing of removed degrees of freedom (fixed movements or rotations along or around axes)\nNow, behavior of geometrical constraints is simpler. All constraints remove degrees of freedom (fix movement along or rotation around axes). This information is legible listed in tables, or in constraint panel. Before removing some constraint related to fixed axis, you are acknowledged. Also, you can see a complete list of possible collisions between new and existing constraints, if you create a colliding constraint. This prevents possibility of unexpected behavior later.\n\nFurther improvements in STEP input\nMinor changes in DWG/DXF input\nMinor changes in 3D kernel\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. \n\nHomepage: http://www.varicad.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with given name/key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6da3670d3066ec9df7298ca35f9a75ff45c228dc","amp;dn":"VariCAD+2013+v2.01+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6da3670d3066ec9df7298ca35f9a75ff45c228dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,163,103,13,48,102,236,157,247,41,140,163,95,154,117,255,69,194,40,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
