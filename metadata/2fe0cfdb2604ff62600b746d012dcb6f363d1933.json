Start by dissecting up to three distinctive audio samples, using IrisÃŠÂ¼s spectrogram display and easy selection tools to spotlight the most interesting spectral characteristics. Blend and layer your modiÃ¯Â¬ï¿½ed samples, then beef up their impact with a choice of suboscillator waveforms.\n\nKEY FEATURES\nDiscover what's inside any sound: Load audio into Iris and explore spectral details that a regular waveform locks away.\nHighlight what intrigues you: Extract and isolate the most interesting sonic components with a full suite of visual selection tools.\nCombine the unthinkable: Layer completely diverse sound sources into totally unique combinations... what do a tattoo needle and a swamp bird and a slot machine sound like together?\nStay musical: Rely on intelligent root note detection to help shape musical material from noise, ambient textures, soundscapes... even mistakes!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe0cfdb2604ff62600b746d012dcb6f363d1933","amp;dn":"iZotope.Iris+v1.0+x86+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe0cfdb2604ff62600b746d012dcb6f363d1933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,224,207,219,38,4,255,98,96,11,116,109,1,45,203,111,54,61,25,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
