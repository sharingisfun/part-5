Here, bestselling author David Shenk chronicles its intriguing saga, from ancient Persia to medieval Europe to the dens of Benjamin Franklin and Norman Schwarzkopf. Along the way, he examines a single legendary game that took place in London in 1851 between two masters of the time, and relays his own attempts to become as skilled as his Polish ancestor Samuel Rosenthal, a nineteenth-century champion. With its blend of cultural history and ShenkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal interest, The Immortal Game is a compelling guide for novices and aficionados alike.\n\nAbout the Author\nDavid Shenk is the national bestselling author of five previous books, including THE FORGETTING (&quot;remarkable&quot; - Los Angeles Times), DATA SMOG (&quot;indispensable&quot; - New York Times), and THE IMMORTAL GAME (&quot;superb&quot; - Wall Street Journal).
