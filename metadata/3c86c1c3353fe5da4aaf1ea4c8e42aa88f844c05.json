As with Treuts first film, Jungfrauenmaschine, Gendernauts, enters a minority sector of San Fransisco culture. The characters in this film have a lot to complain about, and they do. They are people whose physical appearance (female) does not match their inner sexual identity (male). The subject is pinpointed in the film independant of sexual orientation. Leave your conservative hats at the door, this is going to need your special attention.\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192069/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192069/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c86c1c3353fe5da4aaf1ea4c8e42aa88f844c05","amp;dn":"Gendernauts+%28Transsexual+%2F+Transgender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c86c1c3353fe5da4aaf1ea4c8e42aa88f844c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,134,193,195,53,63,229,218,74,175,30,164,200,228,42,168,143,132,76,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
