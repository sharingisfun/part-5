The response by the powerful Confederation Fleet has been swift and decisive, but for every planet they restore order to, another erupts into chaos.\n\nOmega Force is working along the frontier worlds when they're forced to come to the aid of a longtime ally and soon realize that the two events are not unrelated. The deeper they dig into the occurrences, the more Captain Burke finds he doesn't know who he can trust as he tries to unravel the mystery and not only exonerate his friend but keep himself, and his crew, alive.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bb7d6a3bba84148e83e87ab62858eba11740353","amp;dn":"Omega+force%3A+The+Enemy+Within+by+Joshua+Dalzelle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bb7d6a3bba84148e83e87ab62858eba11740353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,183,214,163,187,168,65,72,232,62,135,171,98,133,142,186,17,116,3,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
