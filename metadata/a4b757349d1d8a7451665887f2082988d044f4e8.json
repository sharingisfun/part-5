They have only the clothes on their backs and a cart filled with supplies from their homeland.\n\nThe townspeople of Banished are your primary resource. They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enoughÃ¢â‚¬â€there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own.\n\nBanished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.\n\nThere are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.\n\nThe success or failure of a town depends on the appropriate management of risks and resources.\nSystem Requirements\n\n    Minimum:\n        OS: Win XP SP3 / Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8\n        Processor: 2 GHz Intel Dual Core processor\n        Memory: 512 MB RAM\n        Graphics: 512 MB DirectX 9.0c compatible card (shader model 2)\n        DirectX: Version 9.0c\n        Hard Drive: 250 MB available space\n        Sound Card: Any\n\nScreenShots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZZpyZGu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZZpyZGu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6s0qtsl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6s0qtsl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LZtFPG3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LZtFPG3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WgINqaI.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WgINqaI.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4b757349d1d8a7451665887f2082988d044f4e8","amp;dn":"Banished.v1.0.3.Beta.Build.140531.Cracked-3DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4b757349d1d8a7451665887f2082988d044f4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,183,87,52,157,29,138,116,81,102,88,135,242,8,41,136,208,68,244,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
