Start here. This Essential Training course covers all the latest features in Maya 2015, while giving you a background in the basics of 3D modeling, texturing, animating, and rendering. Need a quick overview? Check out the first chapter of the course, which covers the interface and basic object manipulation tools. Author George Maestri then takes you deeper into polygonal modeling, editing and refining meshes, and NURBS modelingÃ¢â‚¬â€for sculpting curves and organic surfaces in Maya. After that, learn how to create and apply materials to give the surface of your models color, texture, reflectivity, and more. Next, create realistic images (with lighting and depth-of-field effects) in the final rendering process, and finally, add movement and life to your characters with Maya's animation tools.\nTopics include:\nGetting familiar with the Maya interface\nCreating hierarchies and layers\nCreating polygonal objects\nWorking with subdivision surfaces\nExtruding a mesh\nSmoothing geometry\nLofting and extruding with the NURBS curves tools\nConverting NURBS to polygons\nCreating and applying texture maps\nApplying UV mapping\nAdding lights and cameras to a scene\nCreating realistic effects such as depth of field\nBatch rendering\nAnimating in Maya","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8539c32f3c25e3bd9d931f97ae0d29e3b9b3f4ee","amp;dn":"Maya+2015+Essential+Training+by+George+Maestri.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8539c32f3c25e3bd9d931f97ae0d29e3b9b3f4ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,57,195,47,60,37,227,189,157,147,31,151,174,13,41,227,185,179,244,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
