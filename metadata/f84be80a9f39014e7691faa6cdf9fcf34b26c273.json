In addition to this show on the 4th, he played another night on the 5th and a rare matinee show on the 6th of November. All three shows included Quicksilver Messenger Service and Andrew Staples on the bill.\n\nAlthough Waters (born McKinley Morganfield) would continue recording and performing until his death in 1983, many consider the touring band featured on this show among the finest backing bands he would ever front. Featuring George Smith on harmonica and Luther &quot;Georgia Boy&quot; Johnson on guitar (along with Waters himself), the band was obviously enjoying their newfound audience, which consisted mostly of San Francisco's emerging hippie community.\n\nLike many of Waters' live recordings, this is a far from perfect performance. His guitar is usually out of tune on the higher strings, and he doesn't always get the words right. But who cares? This is a testament to the talent of a real Chicago blues pioneer, and it's fantastic, warts and all.\n\nMuddy Waters Blues Band\nNov 5, 1966\nFillmore Auditorium \nSan Francisco, CA\n\nTracklist Disc 2\n\n01.

Born In Chicago(2:06)\n\nOf the three shows the legendary Muddy Waters played at San Francisco's Fillmore West the weekend of November 4, 5 and 6th, 1966, this second show on Saturday evening certainly featured the best array of his hits. All three shows include Quicksilver Messenger Service and Andrew Staples on the bill, but it seems clear that it was the Big Muddy that audiences came to hear.\n\nPlaying the Fillmore West was a new challenge for Waters, who had built his career playing juke joints and blues clubs in urban meccas like Chicago, New York and Detroit\n\nMuddy Waters Blues Band \nNov 6, 1966\nFillmore Auditorium \nSan Francisco, CA \nTracklist Disc 3\n\n01. Chicken Shack (6:09)\n02. You Can't Lose What You Never Had (4:27)\n03. Forty Days And Forty Nights (4:14)\n04. Baby Please Don't Go (2:53)\n05. Thirteen Highway (11:18 )\n06.

Instrumental (1:12)\n\nHere it is straight from the source. Taped at the Fillmore Auditorium in the fall of 1966, this is Muddy's electric band in all its swaggering glory. Boogying guitar and shuffling drums provide the bedrock for Muddy's husky bellowing as he delivers classics like &quot;You Can't Lose What You Never Had&quot; and &quot;Baby Please Don't Go.&quot; The tempo of this set may be a little slow for those accustomed to modern &quot;blues,&quot; but this is how it was meant to be played - loose and meandering.\n\nMuddy Waters - vocals, guitar\nFrancis Clay - drums\nMac Arnold - bass\nSammy Lawhorn - guitar\nGeorge Smith - harmonica\nLuther &quot;Georgia Boy&quot; Johnson - guitar \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f84be80a9f39014e7691faa6cdf9fcf34b26c273","amp;dn":"Muddy+Waters+Blues+Band+Live+at+The+Fillimore%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Bro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f84be80a9f39014e7691faa6cdf9fcf34b26c273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,75,232,10,159,57,1,78,118,145,250,166,205,249,252,243,75,38,194,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
