My 40 somethings will recognize it immediatly. nuff said enjoy.\n\nRATED X was formed at the suggestion of Frontiers president Serafino Perugino, who mentioned to singer Joe Lynn Turner that a band of highest-caliber musicians should be assembled to create an album of classic hard rock music.\n Turner, the former lead vocalist for both RAINBOW and DEEP PURPLE and a solo artist in his own right, agreed, and the search for the right players was on.\n\n Carmine Appice, who already had a relationship with Frontiers, was on board immediately. A true percussion icon, Appice's resume is one that rock legends are made of: VANILLA FUDGE, CACTUS, OZZY OSBOURNE, ROD STEWART, BLUE MURDER, KING KOBRA and others.\n\nAppice's former BLUE MURDER bandmate and bassist Tony Franklin (best known for his work with THE FIRM, Jimmy Page, Paul Rodgers, David Gilmour, Kate Bush and WHITESNAKE) signed up next.\n After a lengthy search for the right guitarist, they settled on longtime Turner collaborator Karl Cochran, who has also worked with Ace Frehley in the past.\n\n&quot;I believe we wanted to keep it a bit retro with a modern edge,&quot; says Turner. &quot;The songs are classic rock, but then that's an understatement. They are what they are; and they transformed as we went along recording. So, all in all, we are very happy to finish the record and finally able to get it out to the public. Everyone in this band is a true individual and stylist. When you put it all together, you have RATED X.&quot;\n\nThe debut album, simply titled &quot;Rated X&quot;, is remarkable in that it sounds like a band that has worked together as a unit for years. The songs are powerful and the performances are tight and innovative. Frontiers in-house producer Alessandro del Vecchio not only handled studio production but added keyboards on several tracks. Pat Regan (MR. BIG, DEEP PURPLE, GOTTHARD, KISS, DORO) mixed the album.\n\nSays Appice: &quot;With [Alessandro's] help in coming up with the song ideas and working together with the band, I believe we came up with the sound from the late '70s-'80s. To me, it sounds like BLUE MURDER with Joe Lynn Turner singing. Having Tony and myself as the rhythm section and with the heavy guitars, it gives the record a BLUE MURDER vibe. Then, adding Alessandro on keys gave us a bit of the DEEP PURPLE thing. It all works together and I loved playing each song.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Rated X\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.

Stranger In Us All\n\nLabel: Frontiers Records\n\n\nWith many years of experience on stage and being a lead singer of Rainbow and Deep Purple, Joe Lynn Turner has kept the charisma and the energy and immerses us in a new adventure of classic rock.\n\nNow being a front man of &quot;Rated X&quot; band, he is offering another piece of quality hard rock. The new album will be available on November 7th in Europe and November 10th in America.\n\nÃÂ¢he idea of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rated XÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ came from the Frontier RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ president Serafino Perugino. He suggested to Turner to put together a new rock band, including iconic names from the hard rock music scene.\n\nIt didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long and the members were found: Carmine Appice, a former member of &quot;Blue Murder&quot; and former drummer of &quot;Kiss&quot; joined the group, as well as Tony Franklin who is best known for his work with musicians like Jimi Jamison, Paul Rodgers, David Gilmour, Whitesnake and many others. After a long search for the right guitarist Karl Cochran was found. He collaborated with Turner for a long time and has played on several of his solo albums.\n\nIt should be mentioned that on this &quot;Rated X&quot; album the Bulgarian virtuoso Nikolo Kotzev from the band &quot;Brazen Abbot&quot; also played guitar on some of the tracks.\n\nThe album contains twelve songs and it is characterized by great melodies and symbolic messages. The first track, &quot;Get Back My Crown&quot; has an explosive start. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great opener and prepares us for the remaining portion of quality rock on the album. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followed by &quot;This Is Who I Am&quot;, a dynamic song with bluesy flavored guitars and unbreakable lyrics.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Fire And IceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ starts like a classic rock ballad, but quickly turns into a powerful rock hymn, guided by the infallible vocal performance of Joe Lynn Turner. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Cry No More&quot; has a driving drum beat, rough guitars and a powerful voice of Turner. &quot;Lhasa&quot; has an epic sound. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s starting with a mysterious intro and a couple of seconds later it is followed by the ominous rumble of guitars, drums and the vocal explosion of Joe Lynn Turner.\n\nThe sixth song &quot;Devil In Disguise&quot; is full of heavy guitars accompanied by TurnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raw and expressive singing. &quot;You Are The Music&quot; has a brilliant lead guitar performance. The song is melodic and full of harmony. The next track &quot;Peace of mind&quot; is a great rocking number with Joe Lynn TurnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary vocals.\n\n&quot;Maybe Tonight&quot; is a charming and dreamy song with a magical power in it. &quot;On The Way To The Paradise&quot; is another track full of power and excitement. &quot;Our Love Is Not Over&quot; is another melodic rock ballad with a beautiful guitar solo. The last song from the album &quot;Strangers In Us All&quot; is an interesting combination and a positive ending of this hard rock adventure.\n\nThe debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rated XÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is remarkable indeed. The songs are powerful and exciting with great, tight performances and the exclusive voice of Turner. They can really touch your heart. Joe Lynn Turner told me once: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Music is love and love is musicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, because he always sings with his soul and gives a piece of his heart to the world.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Rated XÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a conglomeration of high class hard rock musicians and a great, new inspiration for many people around the world and for the real hard rock lovers.\n\nThank you for the inspiration! Best wishes and a lot of success in the music adventure called Rock!\n\nGenre: Rock\nSubgenre: Hard Rock\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 139.18 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n12 files\nAdded: 03/04/2015\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
