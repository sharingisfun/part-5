His cheese making skills are challenged by local friend Erica when they enter into the secret world of cheese making. The big event of the month - the Bega Show - is just around the corner and Paul is relying on his friend Tabitha to give him some tips for his showgirl hens. But are they going to be up to scratch? And could Ron the Rooster be a suitable replacement?\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3acb06632008526262453609500351153f59a05e","amp;dn":"River.Cottage.Australia.s02e03.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3acb06632008526262453609500351153f59a05e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,203,6,99,32,8,82,98,98,69,54,9,80,3,81,21,63,89,160,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
