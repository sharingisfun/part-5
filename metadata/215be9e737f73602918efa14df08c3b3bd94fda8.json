The authors emphasize applications and statistical computation. They illustrate the methods with many real and simulated data examples using R, including the packages Rfit and npsm.\n\nThe book first gives an overview of the R language and basic statistical concepts before discussing nonparametrics. It presents rank-based methods for one- and two-sample problems, procedures for regression models, computation for general fixed-effects ANOVA and ANCOVA models, and time-to-event analyses. The last two chapters cover more advanced material, including high breakdown fits for general regression models and rank-based inference for cluster correlated data.\n\nThe book can be used as a primary text or supplement in a course on applied nonparametric or robust procedures and as a reference for researchers who need to implement nonparametric and rank-based methods in practice. Through numerous examples, it shows readers how to apply these methods using R.\n\nProduct Description\nAbout the Author\n\nJohn Kloke is a biostatistician and assistant scientist at the University of WisconsinÃ¢â‚¬â€œMadison. He has held faculty positions at the University of Pittsburgh, Bucknell University, and Pomona College. An R user for more than 15 years, he is an author and maintainer of numerous R packages, including Rfit and npsm. He has published papers on nonparametric rank-based estimation, including analysis of cluster correlated data.\n\nJoseph W. McKean is a professor of statistics at Western Michigan University. He has published many papers on nonparametric and robust statistical procedures and has co-authored several books, including Robust Nonparametric Statistical Methods and Introduction to Mathematical Statistics. He is an associate editor of several statistics journals and a fellow of the American Statistical Association.\n\nPublisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 1 edition (2 October 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439873437\nISBN-13: 978-1439873434","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215be9e737f73602918efa14df08c3b3bd94fda8","amp;dn":"%5BJohn+Kloke+%2C+Joseph+W.+McKean+%28Author%29+%5DNonparametric+Statistic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215be9e737f73602918efa14df08c3b3bd94fda8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,91,233,231,55,247,54,2,145,142,250,20,223,8,195,179,189,148,253,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
