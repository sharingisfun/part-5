They have a talent that is un-paralleled, and this shows on this hits album.\n\nIf you don't know what album to get, but want to get into this band, buy Decade, as it has every single hit they've ever recorded - &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot;, &quot;Girls On Film&quot;, &quot;Save A Prayer&quot;, &quot;A View To A Kill&quot;, &quot;The Reflex&quot; and &quot;Wild Boys&quot;, amongst some other fantastic tunes.\n\nPop-tastic, in the 80s way.\n\nThis is strange for me to rate, as I am generally a rocker at heart, but the 80s are my weakness, and Duran Duran are my biggest weakness from that time. And yes, I am going to see them in about three months and can't wait.\n\nBut seriously, this album is absolutely AMAZING, and everyone must own it who likes this type of New Romantic music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67bd59d7ce5086f550b9d0fee91939f459c7e0ba","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+Decade+-+Greatest+Hits+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67bd59d7ce5086f550b9d0fee91939f459c7e0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,189,89,215,206,80,134,245,80,185,208,254,233,25,57,244,89,199,224,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
