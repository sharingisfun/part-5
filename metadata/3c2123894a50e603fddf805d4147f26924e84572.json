Note that TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 5 outputs only DVD-Video or Blu-ray compliant MPEG-2 files, not a media volume. You will need an authoring application such as TMPGEnc Authoring Works 4 to build a media volume. \n* MPEG file output for Mobile Device support. In addition to iPod, iPhone or iPad, TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 5 provides a complete and simple environment to create MPEG-4 (AVC) files playable by mobile devices such as the PSP or the WALKMAN (Lyric display support models). Just select an output target and your file is ready! \n* Output support for MPEG-4 AVC, AVI, DivX, Windows Media Video, QuickTime, MKV, and many other formats. TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 5 can output Windows Media Video (WMV) or AVI files by using the Windows installed codecs, or in DivX format by using its own DivX encoder, or QuickTime files through the QuickTime output functions, and even in the MKV (Matroska) file format. \n* DVD-Video, Blu-ray, AVCHD, HDV and DV input support. Thanks to its DVD-Video and Blu-ray (including AVCHD) importation support, TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 5 can even use materials from authored media.

By supporting the Intel Media SDK 2.0, MPEG-4 (AVC) decoding and encoding can also be done through highly optimized algorithms. CPUs with embedded graphics functions and compatible with the Intel Media SDK 2.0 can provide hardware decoding and encoding for faster output. \n* Complete, integrated MPEG Tool. The MPEG Tool provides simple and advanced functions to multiplex (merge) or demultiplex (extract) MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 content into and from MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, or MKV containers. Using this tool, you can merge together several supported streams into one file, or conversely extract one or more streams such as audio or video from a multiplexed stream file into elementary data streams. \n* Project Checker Tool.
