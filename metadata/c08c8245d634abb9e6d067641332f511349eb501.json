But once AUTHORISED, the P&amp;M Chainer acts as a host application that can also load and &quot;Chain&quot; any VST effects and/or VSTi virtual instruments.\n\nUsers can therefore use the Chainer to save great effect presets or any VSTi virtual instrument patches that can be recalled from any DAW at anytime needed.\n\nFor example, let's say you are a guitarist and want to save typical sound patches. The Chainer enables you to load up to 32 effects in series or parallel. So you may want to load and save a compressor, an EQ, an Amp sim, a delay, a reverb, a chorus, etc, and save the whole thing within a patch that can be loaded in other sessions or even other DAWs. The same concept can be applied to vocal patches, drum patches, or any other typical effect chains that you want to recall in future sessions. A time saver !\n\nDrag and Drop functionalities enables users to conveniently change the order of the effects and/or virtual instruments they load within the Chainer. A mixer section enables users to solo, mute and control the level, Mix and Pan of each effects or instruments loaded in the chainer. The chainer also provides convenient Spectrum, 1/3 Octave Graphic EQ, Phase and audio Waveform visualisation to control the audio signals processed within the Chainer...\n\nThe chainer natively contains all of the 45 P&amp;M V.I.P. Series plug-ins making it easy to save/load chained presets of your favourite P&amp;M Plug-ins. The Chainer is FREE for all REGISTERED P&amp;M Plug-in owners. Therefore, the Chainer will automatically detect any authorised P&amp;M plug-ins, ready to use. They can be chained in series or parallel to save/load presets that can be used in other sessions or even other DAWs.\n\nWhen AUTHORISED, the Chainer works as a VST Wrapper utility that can load and &quot;Chain&quot; any VST effects or VSTi virtual instruments. The Chainer loads as a plug-in within all major recording host applications including Pro Tools and can open up many creative sound layering and effects chaining options.\n\nChainer Demo limitations are :\n\nIf not authorised, the Chainer can load VST effects or instruments but the sound will be muted for a short time every 45 seconds. Presets and automations are saved and can be recalled.\n\nP&amp;M Plug-ins Demo limitations are :\n\n- if P&amp;M plug-ins are not authorised, they stop processing signal after 30 minutes.\n- Presets cannot be saved.\n- Controls cannot be automated.\n- After 30 minutes you may relaunch the plug-in for your demo to become active again.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Convenient rack-based effect chaining.\n- Multiple synths / effects racks with serial and parallel routing schemes.\n- Custom displays for visualizing sound output.\n- Includes AAX 64bit version for use inside of Pro Tools... a full featured VST wrapper.\n- MIDI enabled plug-in that conveniently loads virtual instruments with amazing audio effects.\n\n* Activate both Chainer and VIP Bundle for full potential.\n* VIP Bundle is included but only works under Chainer.\n* You need another package if you want to get AU/VST/RTAS/AAX versions of the VIP Bundle plugins.\n\nIf you have the previous version you do not need to register.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeyGen APP OS X 2015 [dada]\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:20651D1EA324D6E2A6CE3A7F37F957139608EF6E\n\nPlug And Mix VIP Bundle v3.2.0 MacOSX Incl Keygen-R2R [oddsox]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtscene.cc\ncastradio.net\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (04)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08c8245d634abb9e6d067641332f511349eb501","amp;dn":"Plug+And+Mix+Chainer+v1.1.0+OS+X+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08c8245d634abb9e6d067641332f511349eb501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,140,130,69,214,52,171,185,230,208,103,100,19,50,245,17,52,158,181,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
