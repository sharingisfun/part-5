Ganapathy\nEnglish | 2002 | ISBN: 0824708148 | 646 pages | PDF | 2.90 MB\n\nFilled with over 225 boiler/HRSG operation and design problems, this book covers steam generators and related systems used in process plants, refineries, chemical plants, electrical utilities, and other industrial settings. Emphasizing the thermal engineering aspects, the author provides information on the design and performance of steam generators and heat recovery boilers. He helps those involved in development understand which questions to ask when selecting a steam generator for their project. The book includes many easy to use calculations and effectively explains the theory behind the design and performance of all types of boilers, superheaters and economizers including specialty boilers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7c41a1cb7737a5f992ddbef972cb7da3d1203a","amp;dn":"Industrial+Boilers+and+Heat+Recovery+Steam+Generators","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7c41a1cb7737a5f992ddbef972cb7da3d1203a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,124,65,161,203,119,55,165,249,146,221,190,249,114,203,125,163,209,32,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
