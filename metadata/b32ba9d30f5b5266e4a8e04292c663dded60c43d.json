Dudley worked  at Bell Laboratories,  and this is  where the first \n   Vocoder took shape. The basic function of a Vocoder is characterized by  an \n   analysis of the input signal, usually  speech but other type of inputs  can \n   also be very interesting. In a special filter bank, a spectral analysis  is \n   performed and signals  are developed which  follows the amount  of spectral \n   energy in each  channel. Another part  of the analyzer  tests if there  are \n   unvoiced or voiced sounds at any particular time and extracts the pitch  of \n   the  voiced  sounds.  The  output section  of  the  vocoder  consists of  a \n   stereophonic synthesis filter bank which assembles the new synthetic speech \n   from the characteristic filter  envelopes from the analysis  stage together \n   with an external or internal replacement signal. \n             \n   What makes MATRIX different to the vocoders in the past ?  \n             \n   Precise  analog  modelling  8-pole  filters  and  extremely  fast  envelope \n   followers  for unprecedented resynthesis quality. \n             \n   New  voiced/unvoiced detection  and pitch  extraction algorithms  for high \n   intelligibility. \n             \n   Stereophonic synthesis filter bank preserves the spatial characteristic  of \n   the replacement signal. \n             \n   Easy to use interface. \n             \n   Latency free operation. \n             \n             \n   Features: \n             \n             \n   The Voice Coder \n             \n   - 32 channel filter bank. \n   - stereophonic synthesis. \n   - voiced/unvoiced detection \n   - Pitch tracking \n   - Formant shift \n   - Pause filling \n   - Channel matrix \n   - Pan position and level for each channel. \n   - 16 internal oscillators. \n   - Easy user interface. \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5\n   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version\n   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3\n   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b32ba9d30f5b5266e4a8e04292c663dded60c43d","amp;dn":"VirSyn.Matrix.VST.RTAS.v1.2.1-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b32ba9d30f5b5266e4a8e04292c663dded60c43d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,43,169,211,15,91,82,102,228,168,224,66,146,198,99,221,237,96,196,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
