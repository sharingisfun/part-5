Blair \n\nProduct Description\nDesign and Simulation of Two-Stroke Enginesis a unique hands-on information source. The author, having designed and developed many two-stroke engines, offers practical and empirical assistance to the engine designer on many topics ranging from porting layout, to combustion chamber profile, to tuned exhaust pipes. The information presented extends from the most fundamental theory to pragmatic design, development, and experimental testing issues.\n\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 700 pages\nPublisher: Society of Automotive Engineers Inc (December 1996)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1560916850\nISBN-13: 978-1560916857","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbe69314d94a927ae717abc5b6b9da11b0078bfc","amp;dn":"Design+and+Simulation+of+Two-Stroke+Engines+by+Gordon+P.+Blair+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbe69314d94a927ae717abc5b6b9da11b0078bfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,230,147,20,217,74,146,122,231,23,171,197,182,185,218,17,176,7,139,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
