Overwhelmed by the moment, he swears that Luke will not have the same tragic life he has had. Escaping a prison sentence by the skin of his teeth, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s given one last chanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦While serving a community service order, he meets Rhino, Albert and Mo who, like him, find it impossible to find work because of their criminal records. Little did Robbie imagine how turning to drink might change their lives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not cheap fortified wine, but the best malt whiskies in the world. Will it be slopping out for the next twenty years, or a new future with Uisge Beatha the Ã¢â‚¬ËœWater of Life?
