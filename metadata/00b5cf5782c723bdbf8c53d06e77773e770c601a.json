In 1995, Laurent Brancowitz, Mazzalai's older brother, permanently joined the band on guitar after the end of the short-lived band Darlin' he formed with Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (who together became Daft Punk). The group got their touring start on the French bar circuit doing Hank Williams and Prince covers. Two years later the band took on the name Phoenix and pressed 500 copies of a single on their own label, Ghettoblaster. Shortly after, they were signed to the Paris-based Source Records. Phoenix became well acquainted with labelmates Air when they acted as their backing band on several U.K. TV appearances.[2] They were the backing band for a remix of Air's &quot;Kelly Watch the Stars&quot; single. Soon after, Phoenix released their 2000 debut album United.\n\nFollowing their two singles &quot;If I Ever Feel Better&quot; and &quot;Too Young&quot;, United was released in 2000. Their track &quot;Too Young&quot; was in the soundtrack for the movie Lost in Translation, and was also played in the movie Shallow Hal.\n\nThe second album, Alphabetical, released in 2004, saw the band reach more mainstream success, with the singles &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; and &quot;Run Run Run&quot; reaching some alternative rock airplay charts. Hedi Slimane commissioned a special mix of their song &quot;Victim of the Crime&quot; as the soundtrack to one of his runway shows for Dior Homme.\n\nFollowing Alphabetical, the band toured three continents, playing 150 dates. This tour was followed up with a live album, Live! Thirty Days Ago, released only 30 days after the end of the tour.\n\nPhoenix then spent time in Berlin during the summer of 2005, making use of Planet Roc studios to produce their third album, It's Never Been Like That. To promote the release of It's Never Been Like That, Phoenix toured the United States and Europe in 2006.\n\nIn early 2009, it was announced that the band was returning with a new album titled Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, which was released on May 25, 2009[3]. The album was recorded in Paris by Cassius's Philippe Zdar who co-produced and mixed the album.[4] The track &quot;1901&quot;, a tribute to early Paris, was released on February 23, 2009, as a free download prior to the release of the first single, and aired for the first time on Australian radio station Triple J.\n\nTheir track &quot;1901&quot; was used for the theatrical trailer of the film New York, I Love You and has been featured in commercials for the 2010 Cadillac SRX. &quot;Lisztomania&quot; was used in trailers for Where The Wild Things Are, Alice in Wonderland and Valentine's Day. It was also used in the season premiere of Cougar Town, an episode from the first season of USA Network's Royal Pains, and was also featured in the season six finale of HBO's Entourage. It was also used in Season 1 Episode 18 of The Vampire Diaries during the Founders' Day Celebration. An excerpt from &quot;Love Like a Sunset&quot; can be heard in the Ghost Town episode of the tenth CSI:Crime Scene Investigation season and the season 7 premiere of One Tree Hill. This instrumental of this song is also used in the 606 football podcast on BBC 5 live.\n\nTo promote the album with live performances, Phoenix performed &quot;Lisztomania&quot;, &quot;1901&quot;, and &quot;Too Young&quot; on Saturday Night Live on April 4.[5]. They also performed &quot;Lisztomania&quot; on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, &quot;Girlfriend&quot; on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and &quot;1901&quot; on The Late Show with David Letterman and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. [6]\n\nOn December 2, 2009, nominations for the 2009 Grammy Awards were released, with Phoenix receiving a nomination for the album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix for Best Alternative Music Album. On January 31, 2010 Phoenix won the Grammy Award in this category. Shortly afterwards, &quot;1901&quot; peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot Alternative Songs chart[7]. Phoenix performed at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California on Sunday, April 18, 2010 and is scheduled to perform at the 2010 Bonnaroo Music Festival in June 2010 and at the 2010 Lollapalooza Music Festival in August. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Phoenix 2009\n\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Phoenix is the fourth studio album album by the French alternative rock band Phoenix. It was released internationally by V2 Records on 25 May 2009. The album is mixed by Philippe Zdar, who also mixed Phoenix's debut studio album, United. Zdar also plays the drums on a few songs. Phoenix released the song &quot;1901&quot; as a free download on 23 February 2009 when the redesigned official website launched.[1] It was awarded the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards held on January 31, 2010.\n\n\nThe term used for the title of the album's second single, &quot;Lisztomania&quot;, was coined by the German romantic literary figure Heinrich Heine to describe the massive public response to Franz Liszt's virtuosic piano performances. There were allegedly screaming women at these performances, and the audience was sometimes limited to standing room only.[3].\n\nThe inspiration for &quot;Love Like a Sunset&quot; came to vocalist Thomas Mars during a car journey.[4]\n\nFrom May 12, 2009, the album was available to download from the iTunes Store for customers in North America[5] and from Amazon MP3.[6]\n\nOn 7 August 2009, Phoenix performed a live version of &quot;Lisztomania&quot; on Australian youth radio network Triple J in a program called &quot;Like a Version&quot;.[7] Phoenix used Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies to help them in the creative process for this album.\n\nThe track &quot;1901&quot; has been used for the theatrical trailer of the film New York, I Love You, featured in commercials for the 2010 Cadillac SRX, and has been the theme song for Melrose Place[citation needed][dubious ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ discuss]. &quot;Lisztomania&quot; has also been featured in a trailer for Valentine's Day. The instrumental track of &quot;1901&quot; is also used in the 606 football podcast on BBC 5 live.\n\n&quot;Love Like a Sunset&quot; is currently used in the theatrical trailer for Sofia Coppola's latest film, Somewhere.\n\nIn Australia, the album debuted at #13.[8] It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart at #37 and remained in the Top 100 for several weeks due to the alternative radio success of the album's second single &quot;1901.&quot;\n\nThe album won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album on January 31, 2010.\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Lisztomania&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;1901&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Fences&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Love Like a Sunset Part I&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Love Like a Sunset Part II&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Lasso&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Rome&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Countdown (Sick for the Big Sun)&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Girlfriend&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Armistice&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00b5cf5782c723bdbf8c53d06e77773e770c601a","amp;dn":"Phoenix+-+Wolfgang+Amadeus+Phoenix+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00b5cf5782c723bdbf8c53d06e77773e770c601a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,181,207,87,130,199,35,189,191,140,83,208,110,119,119,62,119,12,96,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
