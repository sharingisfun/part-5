W. Pabst, which he made for Nero Films, a production company headed up by Seymour Nebenzahl. Like the contemporary Hollywood production All Quiet on the Western Front, Pabst's film is a bitter, melancholy antiwar statement. The story concentrates on four German soldiers, sent to the front in the waning days of World War 1. The futility of killing an enemy who is already dead spiritually, and of being killed for a cause that has for all intents and purposes been resolved, is brought home to the viewer with both barrels. The astonishingly fluid camerawork of Fritz Arno puts the spectator in the thick of the battle, and the effect is both terrifying and heartbreaking To watch only a few moments of Westfront 1918, one might think that Pabst had been making sound pictures all his life, rather than a mere couple of months. - by Hal Erickson.\n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name: Westfront.Pabst.1930.DVDRip.Teeninlove.Forrest.avi\nFile Size (in bytes): 1,561,421,824\n\n--- Container Information ---\nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;): AVI(.AVI)\nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;): OpenDML (AVI v2.0),\nInterleave (in ms): 40\nPreload (in ms): 512\nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;): Split\nTotal System Bitrate (kbps): 0\nBytes Missing (if any): 0\nNumber of Audio Streams: 1\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;): XVID\nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;): XviD 1.1.2 Final\nVideo Codec Status(e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot;): Codec(s) are Installed\nDuration (hh:mm:ss): 1:28:19\nFrame Count: 132452\nFrame Width (pixels): 700\nFrame Height (pixels): 524\nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot; 1.336\nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;): 1.000\nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;): 1.336\nFields Per Second:\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 2156\nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;): MPEG-4\nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;): B-VOP\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame: 0.235&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nMPEG Stream ID (e.g. &quot;0xbd&quot;):\nMPEG VOB file Substream(e.g. &quot;0x80&quot;):\nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;): 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Codec Status (e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot;): Codec(s) are Installed\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz): 48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps): 192\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;): CBR\nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo): 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:917ac791df755f61aac42949b4261bd80ad8d52d","amp;dn":"Vier+von+der+Infanterie+AKA+Westfront+1918+%28G.W.+Pabst%2C+1930%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"917ac791df755f61aac42949b4261bd80ad8d52d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,122,199,145,223,117,95,97,170,196,41,73,180,38,27,216,10,216,213,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
