Barbara Stanwyck stars as Lee Leander, a New York City shoplifter who is arrested just before Christmas after trying to filch an expensive piece of jewelry. Her trial delayed until after the holiday, Lee comes to the attention of an assistant district attorney, John Sargent (Fred MacMurray). Although he will be expected to prosecute Lee in a few days, John takes pity on the prisoner, who is from his home state of Indiana. He arranges for her to be released for the holidays and escorts her home, but her mother (Georgia Caine) is not interested in a reunion. So John takes Lee to his own festivities, where Lee is bowled over by the love and affection of the Sargent family, particularly John's mother (Beulah Bondi), who is so unlike her own. Lee and John fall in love, but their return to the Big Apple and Lee's trial loom large over their romance.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032981/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032981/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSpan subs:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3575741/remember-the-night-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3575741/remember-the-night-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector: Mitchell Leisen\n\n\n\n        Barbara Stanwyck ... \tLee Leander\n\n\tFred MacMurray\t... \tJohn Sargent\n\tBeulah Bondi\t... \tMrs. Sargent\n\tElizabeth Patterson\t... \tAunt Emma\n\tWillard Robertson... \tFrancis X.
