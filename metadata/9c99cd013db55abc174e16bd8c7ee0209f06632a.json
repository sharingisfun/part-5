As Louise Kavanagh tries to track him down, she manages to acquire some strange and powerful allies whose goal doesn't quite match her own.\r\n\r\nThe campaign to liberate Mortonridge from the possessed degenerates into a horrendous land battle, the kind that hasn't been seen by humankind for 600 years; then some of the protagonists escape in a very unexpected direction. Joshua Calvert and Syrinx fly their starships on a mission to find the Sleeping God, which an alien race believes holds the key to overthrowing the possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by John Lee\r\nFormat: M4B","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c99cd013db55abc174e16bd8c7ee0209f06632a","amp;dn":"Peter+F.+Hamilton+-+The+Naked+God+%28Night%27s+Dawn+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c99cd013db55abc174e16bd8c7ee0209f06632a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,153,205,1,61,181,90,188,23,78,22,189,140,126,224,32,159,6,99,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
