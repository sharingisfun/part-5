The album is divided into an electric and an acoustic side. On side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll bandÃ¢â‚¬â€a move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk song community. Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; and &quot;A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall&quot;), as his lyrics continued their trend towards the abstract and personal.\n\nThe album reached No. 6 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan's LPs to break into the US top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that Spring. The first track, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, became Dylan's first single to chart in the US, peaking at #39.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n01. \t&quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;   \t2:21\n02. \t&quot;She Belongs to Me&quot;   \t2:47\n03. \t&quot;Maggie's Farm&quot;   \t3:54\n04. \t&quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot;   \t2:51\n05. \t&quot;Outlaw Blues&quot;   \t3:05\n06. \t&quot;On the Road Again&quot;   \t2:35\n07. \t&quot;Bob Dylan's 115th Dream&quot;   \t6:30\n08. \t&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;   \t5:30\n09. \t&quot;Gates of Eden&quot;   \t5:40\n10. \t&quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot;   \t7:29\n11. \t&quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;   \t4:12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f6b99c392f23a84eaba9e27dd984dffc4be4147","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Bringing+It+All+Back+Home+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f6b99c392f23a84eaba9e27dd984dffc4be4147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,107,153,195,146,242,58,132,234,186,158,39,221,152,77,255,196,190,65,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
