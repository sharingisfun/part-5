From the '80s on, his work became increasingly theatrical as he moved into acting and composing. Growing up in Southern California, Waits attracted the attention of manager Herb Cohen, who also handled Frank Zappa, and was signed by him at the beginning of the 1970s, resulting in the material later released as The Early Years and The Early Years, Vol. 2.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Singapore\n02.Clap Hands\n03.Cemetery Polka\n04.Jockey Full Of Bourbon\n05.Tango Till They're Sore\n06.Big Black Mariah\n07.Diamonds &amp; Gold\n08.Hang Down Your Head\n09.Time\n10.Rain Dogs\n11.Midtown (Instrumental)\n12.9th &amp; Hennepin\n13.Gun Street Girl\n14.Union Square\n15.Blind Love\n16.Walking Spanish\n17.Downtown Train\n18.Bride Of Rain Dogs (Instrumental)\n19.Anywhere I Lay My Head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d93cf597b485d8e372ebb9a31a7e0880fc2f9f9","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+-+Rain+Dogs+%281985%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d93cf597b485d8e372ebb9a31a7e0880fc2f9f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,147,207,89,123,72,93,142,55,46,187,154,49,167,224,136,15,194,249,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
