They are the only Australian artists to have a simultaneous #1 album and #1 single in the United States (Business as Usual and &quot;Down Under&quot; respectively).[1] They achieved the same distinction of a simultaneous #1 album and #1 single in the United Kingdom. The group won the 1983 Grammy Award for Best New Artist and sold over 30 million albums worldwide.[citation needed] The band's sound is distinguished by its use of woodwind and brass instruments.\n\n\n\n\nCollections 2004\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nWho Can It Be Now\nDown Under\nBe Good Johnny\nOverkill\nDown By The Sea\nMaria\nMan With Two Hearts\nEverything I Need\nSail To You\nIt's A Mistake\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7711b2a3c2fccc35e1a22d1758ef90d3f6259658","amp;dn":"Men+at+Work+-+Collections+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2004+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7711b2a3c2fccc35e1a22d1758ef90d3f6259658","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,17,178,163,194,252,204,53,225,162,45,23,88,239,144,211,246,37,150,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
