Described as a cross between Metallica and Alice in Chains, the group spent several years playing the Iowa bar circuit before the two men joined Slipknot. Stone Sour re-formed in the early 2000s, though, and quickly distinguished themselves with a pair of gold-selling albums and three Grammy nominations. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.83% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRoadrunner Records\nCatalog:\t\tRR 8888-8\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Orchids\n02.Take A Number\n03.Bother\n04.Through Glass\n05.Choose\n06.Come What(Ever) May\n07.Sillyworld\n08.Say You'll Haunt Me\n09.Threadbare\n10.Nylon 66\n11.Inhale\n12.Get Inside\n13.Road Hogs\n14.Kill Everybody\n15.Tumult\n16.Digital (Did You Tell)\n17.Pieces\n18.Your God\n19.Home Again\n20.3030-150\n21.The Bitter End\n22.My Name Is Allen\n23.Taciturn\n24.Last Of The Real\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncredibly, Stone Sour doesn't have a compilation CD, so I decided to make one myself.
