It was created by Angus Oblong and produced by Film Roman, Random House, Jobsite Productions and Mohawk Productions, Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Animation and is loosely based on a series of characters that Oblong introduced in a picture-book entitled Creepy 'Susie and 13 Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children.' The theme song for the show was composed and performed by They Might Be Giants. The show focuses on the antics of a family who live in a poor valley community who, as a result of extreme pollution and radiation exposure, are all severely disabled and deformed, either physically or mentally. The pollution is the direct result of the lavish lifestyle of a rich community known as &quot;The Hills,&quot; the residents of which continue to exploit and harm the valley residents with absolutely no regard for their safety or well being.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblongs\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219446/\n\nCreator: Angus Oblong.\nDirectors: Joe Horne, Kelly Armstrong, Jack Dyer, Bob Jaques, Skip Jones, Linda Miller, Monte Young.\nWriters: Leonard Dick, Angus Oblong, Jace Richdale, Scott Buck, Eric Friedman, Ben Kull, Jill Soloway.\nStarring: Laraine Newman, Will Ferrell, Jean Smart, Pamela Adlon, Randy Sklar, Jason Sklar, Jeannie Elias, Billy West, Maurice LaMarche, Lea DeLaria, Becky Thyre, Jim Cummings, Carrie Aizley, Debra Wilson.\n\nVLC Player Compatible (verson # 0.8.6f): {Tested and Confirmed}\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01 - Misfit Love\nS1E02 - Narcoleptic Scottie\nS1E03 - Milo Interrupted\nS1E04 - Bucketheads\nS1E05 - Heroine Addict\nS1E06 - The Golden Child\nS1E07 - Flush, Flush, Sweet Helga\nS1E08 - Disfigured Debbie\n\nSeason 2...\n\nS2E01 - Pickles' Little Amazons\nS2E02 - Get Off My Back\nS2E03 - Please Be Genital\nS2E04 - My Name is Robbie\nS2E05 - Father of the Bribe\n\nExtras...\n\nExtras - Art of the Oblongs, The\nExtras - Oblong Picture Book, An\nExtras - Story of the Creator and Actors, The\nExtras - 'This Is Helga' Short\n\nSubtitles...\n\n(To play the subtitle files, drag and drop them into VLC Player when playing the episode.

Hell yeah: those who are most addicted to marijuana, and those who are the biggest junkies of Adultswim. This goes out to Geophage, Demon, and IcyFlamez. Thank you so much for spreading this information online, and getting me into the Adultswim lineup -- without you, I wouldn't have discovered such great favorites. And it is in that spirit, that I release a splendiferous DVD-rip of The Oblongs; perhaps among the top of all Adult Swim cartoons. A television show completely based on class warfare, between the disfigured inhabitants of the valley, poised by their environment and working in miserable conditions; and then the capitalist class living in the hills, oppressing the workers with a company named 'Globocide' (&quot;killing the planet&quot;). And, if you don't believe that this television show is an attack on the capitalist system, then you should check out the extras from the DVD. The creators get into the sociological and political implications of his show. Enjoy, ya'll!]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Three.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2747ddb62ff1b1a00816ec67e7768faedc02b40","amp;dn":"Oblongs%2C+The+-+Seasons+1-2%2BExtras+%5BDVD-Rip%5D+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2747ddb62ff1b1a00816ec67e7768faedc02b40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,116,125,219,98,255,27,26,0,129,110,198,126,119,104,250,237,192,43,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
