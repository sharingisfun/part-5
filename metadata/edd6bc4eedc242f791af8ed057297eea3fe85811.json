Aesthetically, it was one of the first major works of Italian neorealist filmmaking and perhaps the single most \ninfluential example of the style. Historically, it was among the first postwar \nEuropean films to gain a significant audience in the United States, opening the door for a greater appreciation of international filmmaking in America. And politically, it was a work of tremendous bravery. The screenplay was written by Roberto Rossellini in association with Federico Fellini and Sergio Amidei while Rome was still occupied by German forces in 1943-44. Rossellini began filming in secret, using scavenged film stock without sound equipment, shortly before the city was liberated in June of 1944. Several key members of his creative team had been active in the Italian resistance movement. With its rough, documentary-style look, multi-layered narrative, and a cast that mixed amateurs with actors who didn't look like film stars, Roma, Citta Aperta captured the harsh and unforgiving textures of real life as few movies of its time had dared. It set the pace for Italian Neorealism as an influential postwar film style that combined outdoor light and location shooting with non-actors, a focus on simple stories of everyday life, and a concern for the poor and for social problems. Roma, Citte Aperta shows the lives of a group of people living in Rome during the Nazi occupation, after the Germans had declared it an &quot;open city.&quot; Anna Magnani plays a woman in love with a member of a resistance group; in helping him, she risks not only her own life, but also that of her unborn child. Aldo Fabrizi plays a priest who aids the anti-Nazi cause and pays dearly for his activism. Marcello Pagliero is an outspoken communist who runs afoul of the Nazis. And Harry Feist plays a German officer who has taken an Italian lover, but whose affection for Romans does not run especially deep. While Roma, Citta Aperta shows flashes of the melodramatic \nsentimentality that would mark much of Rossellini's later work, it still rings true as a chronicle of a city under siege and as the genesis of a powerful new film style whose influences include such later filmmakers, among many others, as John Cassavetes, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, and Spike Lee. \n\nIMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038890/ | Rating: 8.2 / 10 (5,720 votes)\n                                     \nGeneral.\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : Rome.Open.City.1945.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.66 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 43mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 308 Kbps\nSource                           : Criterion NTSC DVD9\n                                       \nVideo.                     \n\nFormat                           : AVC\nBit rate                         : 1 877 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 1 919 Kbps\nWidth                            : 684 pixels\nHeight                           : 446 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.257\nStream size                      : 1.35 GiB (81%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\nAudio.                           \n\nTrack 1\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nChannel positions                : C\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 142 MiB (8%)\nLanguage                         : Italian\n\nTrack 2 - Commentary by film scholar Peter Bondanella\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nChannel positions                : C\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 142 MiB (8%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nSubtitles.\n\nFormat                           : UTF-8\nCodec ID                         : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info                    : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLanguage                         : English\n\nChapters.\n\n00:00:00.000                     : :Chapter 1\n00:07:42.361                     : :Chapter 2\n00:09:22.962                     : :Chapter 3\n00:13:45.224                     : :Chapter 4\n00:16:32.558                     : :Chapter 5\n00:19:01.373                     : :Chapter 6\n00:22:22.908                     : :Chapter 7\n00:26:03.962                     : :Chapter 8\n00:30:14.546                     : :Chapter 9\n00:32:17.669                     : :Chapter 10\n00:36:01.893                     : :Chapter 11\n00:41:11.869                     : :Chapter 12\n00:44:03.040                     : :Chapter 13\n00:46:44.034                     : :Chapter 14\n00:51:12.769                     : :Chapter 15\n00:55:48.578                     : :Chapter 16\n00:58:25.201                     : :Chapter 17\n01:00:52.048                     : :Chapter 18\n01:04:07.910                     : :Chapter 19\n01:09:48.584                     : :Chapter 20\n01:12:55.104                     : :Chapter 21\n01:15:27.256                     : :Chapter 22\n01:19:03.472                     : :Chapter 23\n01:22:44.859                     : :Chapter 24\n01:26:20.909                     : :Chapter 25\n01:30:15.643                     : :Chapter 26\n01:37:54.101                     : :Chapter 27\n01:43:05.779                     : :Chapter 28\n\nKARiNA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edd6bc4eedc242f791af8ed057297eea3fe85811","amp;dn":"Rome.Open.City.1945.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edd6bc4eedc242f791af8ed057297eea3fe85811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,214,188,78,237,194,66,247,145,175,142,208,87,41,126,234,63,232,88,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
