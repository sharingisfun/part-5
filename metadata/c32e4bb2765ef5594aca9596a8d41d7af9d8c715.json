The result is the most authoritative and scientifically \naccurate description of the revolutionary developments taking \nplace in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, \nnanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics.\nIn all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain \nsensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power \nof our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout \nthe environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow \nus to access the world's information base or conjure up any \nimage we desire in the blink of an eye.\nMeanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-\ntemperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will \neffortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic \nfields and ushering in the age of magnetism.\nUsing molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost \nevery organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of \ntiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will \nsilently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid \nadvances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or \nmaybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life \nspans to increase dramatically.\nIn space, radically new shipsÃ¢â‚¬â€needle-sized vessels using laser \npropulsionÃ¢â‚¬â€could replace the expensive chemical rockets of \ntoday and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in \nnanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which \nwould propel humans hundreds of miles above the earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \natmosphere at the push of a button.\nBut these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. \nKaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, X-ray \nvision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers \nthe development of the world economy. He addresses the key \nquestions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will \nhave jobs, and which nations will prosper?\nAll the while, Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, \nexamining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to \nmature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate \nlimitations and hazards are. Synthesizing a vast amount of \ninformation to construct an exciting look at the years leading up \nto 2100, Physics of the Future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through \nthe next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.\nTech:\nEpub\nHardcover, 906 pages\nPublished March 15th 2011 by Doubleday (first published January 1st 2011)\nedition language:English\n3.79MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32e4bb2765ef5594aca9596a8d41d7af9d8c715","amp;dn":"Physics+of+The+Future+by+Michio+Kaku-epub-zombiRG-FIXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32e4bb2765ef5594aca9596a8d41d7af9d8c715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,46,75,178,118,94,245,89,74,202,149,150,168,212,29,122,249,216,199,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
