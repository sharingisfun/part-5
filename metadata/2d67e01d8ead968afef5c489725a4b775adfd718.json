Now most DAZ Studio users are no longer using the Poser Library as their default any more. But when you want to use a Gen4 pose, you have to navigate to the Poser Library to find and apply the pose. With this batch script you can now convert all of your Gen4 (V4.2, M4 and K4) poses to the current .DUF format in the DAZ Library. Giving your Carpel Tunnel a break :)\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 2 to Genesis 3 Pose Converter\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n \nhttps://cdn.pximg.xyz/7aed094795169a2366d6c6e0af4c9647.jpg\r\n\r\nwww.daz3d.com/catalog/product/view/id/22124\r\n\r\nHave you tried to use your library of Genesis 2 poses on Genesis 3? Are the pose results not matching up quite as expected? Then this product is for you. Genesis 3 contains different rigging, therefore Genesis 2 poses cannot be used without some form of translation in order to represent the original pose. This is where the pose converter comes in. With this batch script you can now convert all of your Genesis 2 Poses to Genesis 3. With just a few clicks, your Genesis3 figure will be in posing heaven.\r\n\r\nProduct features:\r\n\r\nConverts pose sets from Genesis 2 to be compatible with Genesis 3.\r\nCan convert entire Genesis 2 Female or Male pose directory or individual pose sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nV4 Pose Converter for Genesis and Genesis 2 Female\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n \nhttps://cdn.pximg.xyz/198051a683e402bc4b6c48aa7f3c96cd.jpg\r\n\r\nwww.daz3d.com/catalog/product/view/id/22536\r\n\r\nWith these scripts, your Genesis and Genesis 2 Female(s) figures will be able to use years of pose collections designed for V4.
