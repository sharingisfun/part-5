Who do you like that's your age?'&quot;\n\n\nThat conversation prompted Snider to reach out to Dave Schools, bassist of Widespread Panic, where they started discussing plans to record together. They enlisted guitarist Neal Casal (Chris Robinson Brotherhood), keyboardist Chad Staehly (Great American Taxi) and Duane Trucks (King Lincoln) on drums to form a new group they're calling Hard Working Americans.Far from being a one-off super-group session, Hard Working Americans is full of the themes that surround class consciousness and economic despair, which echo Snider's most recent album of original material, 2012's Agnostic Hymns and Stoner Fables. The songs are covers written in the past decade by the likes of Gillian Welch, Hayes Carll, the Bottle Rockets and Randy Newman. \n\n&quot;I've always collected songs on the folk circuit that I felt spoke to me or moved me,&quot; Snider says. &quot;The thing I like about these songs is that the people who wrote them wrote them for themselves to sing, not for me. I really feel like I've lived these songs, even though my friends wrote them.&quot;..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa49f6f11871b71841f8fcc230fb65a9798a9e7","amp;dn":"Hard+Working+Americans+-+Hard+Working+Americans+%5B2014%5D%5BLOG.cue.F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aa49f6f11871b71841f8fcc230fb65a9798a9e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,164,159,111,17,135,27,113,132,31,143,204,35,15,182,90,151,152,169,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
