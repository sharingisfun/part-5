The 17th studio album is as soulful and powerful as ever, including 8 brand new songs. Recorded at Racket studio in England, the album echoes the great layered sound of albums like Marbles and Afraid of Sunlight, all that Marillion fans hope to hear on a new record. Songs like Gaza and Montreal show once more, that epic progressive songwriting can speak the musical language of the new millennium. Power and Lucky Man remind us that pop-rock music can also be powerful and deep.\nThe new album cover has been designed by Simon Ward while the booklet will feature the contribution of artists including Antonio Seijas, Andy Wright, Carl Glover and Marc Bessant.\n\nTrack List:\n01.
