Four lads from Basildon known as Depeche Mode would come to own the new sound whilst post-punk bands like Ultravox, Soft Cell, OMD and Yazoo took the synth out of the pages of the NME and onto the front page of Smash Hits.\n\nBy 1983, acts like Pet Shop Boys and New Order were showing that the future of electronic music would lie in dance music.\n\nContributors include Philip Oakey, Vince Clarke, Martin Gore, Bernard Sumner, Gary Numan and Neil Tennant. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n93c4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n93c4&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777\nFrames per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 87min\nPart Size: 1.22 GB\nNumber of Parts: 1\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-T\n\nThis is not the same as &quot;Synth Britannia at the BBC&quot;.\nThe thread at MVGroup has been deleted.
