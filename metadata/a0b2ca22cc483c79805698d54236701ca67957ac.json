Don't miss it!\n\nBrought to you by TQMP\nThe Quality Music Project\n\nListening to his second album, you wonder quite how Bassekou Kouyate gets such expression out of a simple ngoni. The instrument is essentially nothing more than a funky African banjo, yet in his hands its versatility and dynamism is astonishing, capable of shimmering tenderness on 'Tineni' and taking on the zestful, edgy, rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢roll attack of a lead guitar on 'Ladon', as well as the churning, earthy blues-funk so characteristic of Malian music. Part of the answer, of course, is that he is a true innovator, changing the way the ngoni has traditionally been played, adding extra strings to increase its harmonic flexibility and even inventing a new bass instrument (ngoni ba). His inventiveness has seen him progress from simple accompanist to the likes of Ali Farka Toure and Toumani Diabate to being an award-winning band leader with 2007's Segu Blue. The follow-up, again sympathetically produced by Lucy Duran, is arguably even better. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more assured, boasting the majestic confidence of a musician who knows he's found a unique approach and sound, yet it remains true to the tradition from which he comes. Guest appearances from Vieux Farka Toure (guitar) and Toumani Diabate (kora) create a rich mesh of mesmerising strings while Kouyate's wife Amy Sacko adds suitably wailing vocals. As for the album's title, well the lyrics of the title-track make it clear that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one language that's fairly universal: 'Let me pull you into the hut, touch your haunches and you'll see how well I speak Fula'. It will be a tough call come the end of 2009 to chose between this and Tinariwen's Imdiwan as the best African album of the year.\n-- songlines.co.uk\n\nTracks\n01- I Speak Fula\n02- Jamana Be Diya (feat.
