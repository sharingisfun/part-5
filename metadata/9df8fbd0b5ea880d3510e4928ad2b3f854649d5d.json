HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the cure. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never start a fiction or nonfiction book you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continuously updated too, and updates are free. \n\nFICTION &amp; NONFICTION: Yes, both. Recommended books include not just the must-read books and criticsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ favorites, but lesser-known good books from book club recommendations to Pulitzer Prize winning nonfiction. The selections go beyond just the popular standards; they are the standouts among contemporary books as well as time-tested classics including the best fiction picks of 125 top authors and the most compelling true-life adventures. \n\nOUR CRITERIA \nFICTION: Big sales are not the only gauge of worth, though our reading recommendations donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ignore the bestsellers either; rather we look for authors with a knack for story-telling as well as those that have perfected a particular writing style. (See Ã¢â‚¬Å“Perfect FictionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ below.) \nNONFICTION: We strive to steer you to books by the latest, most respected authorities. Recommended books are by the foremost experts in their fields, including Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winners. In some instances we call upon outside experts to make our picks too. For example, Sports Illustrated picks the best sports books; Fortune magazine chooses the best business books. In the case of biographies and memoirs, we recommend only the best ones on a particular individual, since there are so many out there on the same person. Here, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find only the best biographies and memoirs, the best written ones that tell the whole story. \n\nPERFECT FICTION is not just every great novelistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goal; it was also the goal in selecting inclusions in this extraordinarily thorough guide to books. An experienced team of literary professionals chose works that meet three important criteria found in only the best fiction: \n1. A story so good you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it to end \n2. Unforgettable characters \n3. Writing that hooks you on the first page \n\nTHE CONVENIENCE IS WORTH A FORTUNE \nThis one-stop solution to the best books goes beyond just the most popular books and favorites. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for nonfiction by a Pulitzer Prize winning expert, book club recommendations for a great nove,l or a must-read book everyone is talking about, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to find them. We even offer links to buy them online with one click. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a simple solution to the complex problem of finding good books in a sea of mediocrity. This literary guide focuses on just the best fiction and nonfiction. Use our guide and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never crack a book you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love reading. This is our promise. \n\nTAKE THE LUCK OUT FINDING YOUR NEXT GREAT READ \nThe modest price of this literary guide is far less than the cost of a book you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to finish. And what is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“down timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ you spend on a disappointing book is worth? Probably a lot. Save money and valuable reading time.
