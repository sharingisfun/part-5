The book introduces students to five broad perspectives on human social behavior: social cognition, cultural psychology, evolutionary theory, existential psychology, and social neuroscience. With these perspectives serving as recurring themes, each chapter organically weaves together explanations of theory, research methods, empirical findings, and applications, showing how social psychologists accumulate and apply knowledge toward understanding and solving real-world problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d392fd2d0c6536c66e58452514688ae45c91259","amp;dn":"Social+Psychology%3A+The+Science+of+Everyday+Life+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d392fd2d0c6536c66e58452514688ae45c91259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,57,47,210,208,198,83,108,102,229,132,82,81,70,136,174,69,201,18,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
