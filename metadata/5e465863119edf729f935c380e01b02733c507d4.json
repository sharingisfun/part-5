Even though WebGL makes it possible to create 3D graphics in the browser without having to use plugins, programming WebGL, however, is hard and complex. This book shows you how Three.js allows you to be independent of browser plugins.\n\nIf you are an experienced web designer who wants to set the tone for an immersive design environment in your applications then this book is for you.\n\n&quot;Learning Three.js: The JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL&quot; is a practical, example-rich book that will help you to master all the features of Three.js. With this book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to create and animate gorgeous looking 3D scenes directly in your browser utilizing the full potential of WebGL and modern browsers without having to learn WebGL.\n\n&quot;Learning Three.js: The JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL&quot; starts by going over the basic concepts and building blocks used in Three.js. From there on, it will expand on these subjects using extensive examples and code samples. This will allow you to learn everything you need to know about Three.js in an easy and interactive manner.\n\nBesides the basic concepts, this book will show you how you can create realistic looking 3D objects using materials and textures as well as how to load them from externally created models. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to easily control the camera using the Three.js build-in camera controls so you can fly or walk around the 3D scene you have created. You will also learn how to use morph and bones-based animation and how to add physics to your scene.\n\nAfter reading Learning Three.js: The JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL and playing around with the extensive set of examples, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know everything that is required to create 3D animating graphics using Three.js that run in any browser.\nApproach\n\nThis book contains an extensive set of practical examples and an easy-to-follow approach to creating 3D objects.\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is great for anyone who already knows JavaScript and who wants to start creating 3D graphics that run in any browser. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to know anything about advanced math or WebGL; all that is needed is a general knowledge of JavaScript and HTML. The required materials and examples can be freely downloaded and all tools used in this book are open source.\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e465863119edf729f935c380e01b02733c507d4","amp;dn":"Learning+Three.js+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e465863119edf729f935c380e01b02733c507d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,70,88,99,17,158,223,114,159,147,92,56,14,1,176,39,51,197,7,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
