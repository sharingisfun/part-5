Look At Me (When I Rock Wichoo) \n\n&amp;#039;Partie Traumatic&amp;#039; is the debut LP release from indie rock darlings Black Kids,\n a bracing and invigorating affair with no small amount of hype behind it. Produced\n by ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler and featuring the singles &amp;#039;I&amp;#039;m Not Gonna Teach \nYour Boyfriend How To Dance With You&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Hurricane Jane&amp;#039;, this record balances the\n zeal of youth with an arch, almost literary twist. Though the songs themselves are\n rip-roaring, the sentiments behind them often sum up simple emotional and social truths\n deftly. With influences ranging from 60s guitar pop to 80s post-punk, &amp;#039;Partie Traumatic&amp;#039;\n is intelligent and fun guitar music for the noughties audience.\n\n\n\nBITRATE-320 \nFORMAT-MP3 \nFREQ-44100 \nCHAN 2 STEREO ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe7d8f817d299b91cdaa6eb9bb25b62e01537de","amp;dn":"Black+Kids+-+Partie+Traumatic+%28with+covers%29+a+DHZ.Inc+Release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe7d8f817d299b91cdaa6eb9bb25b62e01537de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,231,216,248,23,210,153,185,28,218,166,235,155,178,91,98,224,21,55,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
