Itâ€™s really the only work of its period to rank with the symphonies of Tchaikovsky (along with, possibly, Balakirevâ€™s First), and Tjeknavorianâ€™s performance of it, indeed of all three works, is outstanding. He doesnâ€™t fuss with or manipulate tempos or textures, preferring instead to keep the music moving energetically and allowing the musicians of the National Philharmonic to inject as much color and vitality as possible. The scherzo flashes by like lightning, the slow movement is aptly seductive, and the finale dazzles. As I suggested, the other two works are less obviously successful, but the performances are no less adept. Produced by Charles Gerhardt, we can expect fine sonics, and thatâ€™s just what RCA delivers. In this music, you wonâ€™t find better.&quot; --David Hurwitz\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Symphony No. 1 in E-Flat\r\nâ€¢ Symphony No. 2 in B Minor\r\nâ€¢ Symphony No. 3 in A Minor (unfinished)\r\n\r\nNational Philharmonic Orchestra\r\nLoris Tjeknavorian\r\n\r\nRecorded February 1977, Kingsway Hall, England\r\nProduced by Charles Gerhardt\r\nRecording Engineers: Kenneth E.
