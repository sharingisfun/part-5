His impressive body of work has covered everything from desert-baked stoner rock to breathy, folk-tinged indie pop, and now, on new EP No Bells on Sunday (a precursor to new LP due this autumn), he adds dreamy hints of electro to the more familiar elements of his sound.\nOpener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dry IcedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ begins in an atmospheric, considered fashion, yet soon evolves into a disarmingly bouncy number, all four-on-the-floor drums and billowing synth pads. LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice remains as darkly stately as always, but he uses his inimitable baritone sparingly, casting surprisingly delicate strands of melody over the lush instrumentation. It works beautifully.\n\nThe song that follows, the EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title track, is even better. A sombre, graceful cousin of Lanegan-featuring Queens Of The Stone Age track Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the FadeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, its simple, lilting vocal melodies, funeral-march rhythms and windswept synth breaks combine to fabulous effect. The introspective spell that this song casts is broken bullishly by its successor, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sad LoverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a more straightforward slice of electro-informed rock vaguely reminiscent of TV on the RadioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more propulsive moments.\n\nFourth track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jonas PapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a fleeting change of direction, two and a half gentle minutes of pretty, melancholic folk augmented by a swooning string arrangement.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Smokestack MagicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ closes the EP in ambitious style, with Lanegan exploring the full extent of his deceptively wide vocal range as layers of heavily distorted guitars, doomy synths and jittery percussion pinwheel energetically around the focal point his voice provides. This final cut goes on for over eight minutes, yet each impassioned phrase Lanegan utters feels vital.\n\nThis EP signifies an extremely successful attempt on LaneganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behalf to keep his career moving, to resist the onset of the kind of complacency that would actually be perfectly understandable for a man who has managed to maintain such an enviably well-respected position in the alternative rock scene for three decades now. If his forthcoming full-length is as consistently superb as this EP, it could be one of the albums of the year.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e9acbdf9c7148ef929d20bb4524f5a2f536ce83","amp;dn":"Mark+Lanegan+Band+-+No+Bells+On+Sunday+EP+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e9acbdf9c7148ef929d20bb4524f5a2f536ce83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,154,203,223,156,113,72,239,146,157,32,187,69,36,245,162,245,54,206,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
