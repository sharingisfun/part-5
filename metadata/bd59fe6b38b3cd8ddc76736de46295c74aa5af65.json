Some interviews I have downloaded fromand converted to avi, there's a lecture Huxley delivered at Berkeley University, a psychedelic documentary about Huxley with interesting excerpts and a few pdf's containing some of Huxley's books.\n\nA book that has influenced me a lot through the years and which I strongly recommend reading/studying is Ends and Means: An Enquiry into the Nature of Ideals and into the Methods employed for their Realization. It's not as famous as Brave New World or Island, but definitely one of his best books IMO.\n\nI hope this torrent is found to be useful, and if so: please seed for a while.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd59fe6b38b3cd8ddc76736de46295c74aa5af65","amp;dn":"Aldous+Huxley+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd59fe6b38b3cd8ddc76736de46295c74aa5af65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,89,254,107,56,179,205,141,220,118,115,109,228,98,149,199,74,165,175,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
