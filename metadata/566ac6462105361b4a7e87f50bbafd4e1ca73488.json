I needed someone...something...to derail me from my current path. Otherwise, I would become lost...a hollowed out shell of a man. So I did it. I approached her, then I pursued her, then I made her mine. And my life was saved...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nRyan Burnham is the privileged son of a U.S. Congressman and captain of his universityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hockey team.
