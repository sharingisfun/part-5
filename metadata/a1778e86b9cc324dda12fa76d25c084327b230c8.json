Beach scene snowglobes. Airbrushed neon sunset\nhotel paintings. All shining examples of potent Fake Escapism at work,\nin real life. And if you've ever wondered what the audio equivalent of\nthis kind of cheap coastal utopian simulacrum is, take a good listen\nto the recorded works of Mr. Matt Mondanile aka Ducktails, a crazy\ntalented suburban New Jerseyan who serves up masterpiece after\nblasterpiece of shimmering, smoke-and-mirrors exotic fantasia, rainbow\npsych-pop muzak for imaginary helicopter rides over crystal lagoons\nand lost waterfalls. His self-released tapes dropped over the past\nyear-plus have seen his basement guitar/rhythm hypnosis instincts\ngently arcing upwards into a total art form, and this, Ducktails'\ndebut full-length CD, is the absolute zenith of the vision. Lazy\nisland percussion loops under blissed horizons of hovering synth\ncolors, warm jangly wah-wah guitars lap like waves alongside casual\nhammock-chilling vocals; song titles like &quot;Beach Point Pleasant&quot; and\n&quot;Dancing With The One You Love&quot; further articulate Mondanile's mood\nagenda: maxin' &amp; relaxin'. A few numbers get a bit more tripped/spaced\nin a loosely post-Pacific City model, but those parts function less\nlike a drug ride and more just like the hazy time of night after the\nbeach bonfire's burned out and you pass out on the sand, holding hands\nwith someone special, staring up at the stars. What do you see?\nEndless blackness? Or a new BFF? CD mastered by Graham Lambkin (of The\nShadow Ring) in a 4-panel digipak with cover artwork by Jan Anderzen\n(of Kemialliset Ystavat/Tomuttontu), plus comes with a bonus song not\nfeatured on the vinyl version of the album. Edition of 500.\n\nTrack Listing\n----------------\n[01/10]\tBackyard\t\t\t\t\t\t(1:37)\t168 kbps\t2.05 MB\n[02/10]\tBeach Point Pleasant\t\t\t\t\t(4:57)\t205 kbps\t7.38 MB\n[03/10]\tPizza Time\t\t\t\t\t\t(2:34)\t212 kbps\t3.93 MB\n[04/10]\tHorizon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2:54)\t144 kbps\t3.02 MB\n[05/10]\tFriends\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(3:28)\t182 kbps\t4.55 MB\n[06/10]\tDancing with the One You Love\t\t\t\t(3:09)\t152 kbps\t3.46 MB\n[07/10]\tGem\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(3:12)\t151 kbps\t3.50 MB\n[08/10]\tDaily Vacation\t\t\t\t\t\t(3:37)\t186 kbps\t4.84 MB\n[09/10]\tThe Mall\t\t\t\t\t\t(2:21)\t195 kbps\t3.32 MB\n[10/10]\tSurf's Up\t\t\t\t\t\t(11:07)\t156 kbps\t12.49 MB\n\nTotal number of files: \t10\nTotal size of files: \t48.58 MB\nTotal playing time: \t38:56\nGenerated: \t\tSaturday, May 16, 2009 5:45:08 PM\n\nCreated with:\t\t#indie.torrents NFO Generator (Mac) v2.3b1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1778e86b9cc324dda12fa76d25c084327b230c8","amp;dn":"Ducktails+-+Ducktails+%282009%29+%5Bchillwave%2Fexperimental%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1778e86b9cc324dda12fa76d25c084327b230c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,119,142,134,185,204,50,77,218,18,250,118,210,92,8,67,39,178,48,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
