Find out by traveling with photographer and educator Justin Reznick to the spectacular Olympic National Park, where he explores three unique regions. First he journeys into the Sol Duc Valley, home of famous forests, creeks, and waterfalls. He brings three lensesÃ¢â‚¬â€wide angle, telephoto, and macroÃ¢â‚¬â€to shoot the valley from a variety of perspectives and focal lengths. Then he lands on Second Beach, experimenting with various foreground-and-background compositions. Last, Justin investigates the Hoh Rain Forest, where he shows how to shoot landscapes in the rain and introduces one more vital piece of equipment: the tilt-shift lens. In the final chapter, he reviews the selects from the shoot and the post-processed results.\n\nTopics include:\n\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tDefining the HIPS acronym for the shooting workflow\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tTaking a serene shot of a creek\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tShooting waterfalls\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tIsolating trees in a forest\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tGetting a macro shot of the forest floor\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tShooting reflective pools\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUsing a tilt-shift lens for a panorama\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tShooting fall foliage\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tComparing polarized shots\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:341d49f312bee2acedf030e24e31fd63a0f3b6e5","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Landscape+Photography%3A+Washington%27s+Olympic+National+Par","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"341d49f312bee2acedf030e24e31fd63a0f3b6e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,29,73,243,18,190,226,172,237,240,48,226,78,49,253,99,160,243,182,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
