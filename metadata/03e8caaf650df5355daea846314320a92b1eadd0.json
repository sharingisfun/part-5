Of her last 30 dates, 29 have ended the same way: the man sobbing uncontrollably. After one such disaster, Sandra--near desperation and maybe a little tipsy--gives in to a seemingly harmless encounter with her hot waiter, Alex. Argumentative, secretive, and hostile Alex may be the opposite of everything Sandra knows is right for her. But now, the girl who has spent all her life helping others change for the better, must find a way to cope with falling for someone who refuses to change at all.\n\nThis is a full-length, 110k word novel and is the third book in the Knitting in the City series. All books in the series can be read as a standalone.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nABOUT PENNY:\nPenny Reid is a part time author of romantic fiction.
