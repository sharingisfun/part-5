Kelley, becomes a hazardous quest into the nature of evil\n\nThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist explores the unusual relationship that took shape in a small prison cell in 1945. The cell held two men: Hermann GÃƒÂ¶ring, the most prominent Nazi leader still standing after HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fall, and Douglas M. Kelley, a young American psychiatrist sent to assess the mental fitness of GÃƒÂ¶ring and his top Nazi colleagues to stand trial at Nuremberg.\n\nSentenced to death at that trial, GÃƒÂ¶ring cheated the hangman in 1946 by swallowing a cyanide capsule just before his execution date. KelleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life spiraled downward into alcoholism, emotional outbursts, and depression. During an argument with his wife on New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day in 1958, he, like GÃƒÂ¶ring, ended his life by swallowing cyanide.\n\nGiven exclusive access to KelleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s records, award-winning journalist Jack El-Hai vividly re-creates the interactions and atmosphere, and explores the insidious impact of the GÃƒÂ¶ring-Kelley relationship, providing a cautionary tale about the dangers of coming too close to evil.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59bc9c2e76542b5bee37e124fbfc151b3683eee4","amp;dn":"The+Nazi+and+the+Psychiatrist-+Hermann+Goring%2C+Dr+Douglas+M+Kell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59bc9c2e76542b5bee37e124fbfc151b3683eee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,188,156,46,118,84,43,91,238,55,225,36,251,252,21,27,54,131,238,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
