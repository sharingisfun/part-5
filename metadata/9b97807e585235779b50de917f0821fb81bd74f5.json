In an easy-to-follow, step-by-step format, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll quickly get to know the ins and outs of Bootstrap while building a portfolio site, a WordPress theme, a business site, an e-commerce interface, and administration interface, and an upscale marketing site.\n\n&quot;Bootstrap Site Blueprints&quot; guides you through the process of building different types of web applications, by leveraging the power of Bootstrap 3. In the process, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll experience the power of customizing and recompiling BootstrapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LESS files and adapting BootstrapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s JavaScript plugins, to the design of an excellent user interface.

You will add custom icon fonts, customize and recompile BootstrapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful LESS files, and leverage BootstrapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s excellent JavaScript plugins to create dynamic user interfaces.\n\nBy the end of this book you will be a more adept and efficient designer.\nApproach\n\nA hands-on guide with projects based on fictitious, but common, application development briefs, which will illustrate practical ways of applying responsive web design with Bootstrap.\nWho this book is for\n\nWhether you are a beginner or intermediate web developer, if you wish to make the most of Bootstrap, then this book is for you.
