This is the 'Complete Edition', published by Pantheon in 2005. \n\nThe book tells the story of the artist's early childhood and adolescence, focusing on his relationship with his brother and sister. His brother develops severe and intractable epilepsy, causing the family to seek a variety of solutions from alternative medicine, most dramatically by moving to a commune based on macrobiotic principles. As the epileptic brother loses control of his own life, the artist develops solitary obsessions with cartoons, mythology and war. The book's graphic style becomes increasingly elaborate as the children's fantasy life takes over, with their dreams and fears (including epilepsy itself) appearing as living creatures. In brief interludes, the children appear as adults when the artist begins the process of writing the story.\n\nThe English translation of the book received very good reviews from critics. The review aggregator Metacritic reported the book had an average score of 92 out of 100, based on 15 reviews. Publishers Weekly has called it &quot;one of the greatest graphic novels ever published.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ca00b349edd65a249ddb5eec6e10459979b544","amp;dn":"David+B+-+Epileptic+%28Pantheon+Complete+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ca00b349edd65a249ddb5eec6e10459979b544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,202,0,179,73,237,214,90,36,157,219,94,236,110,16,69,153,121,181,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
