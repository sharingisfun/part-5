What basically started by revolving punk rock kids - hidden from narrow-minded authorities of suburban desert communities in the early 80s, became a vibe over the years. Desert Rock, often misinterpreted as musical genre continued its international underground spread until today. This is a close look from within its origin on the beginnings: Never-ending jams in the middle of the desert. Lo Sound Desert is narrated by Josh Homme, Brant Bjork, Mario Lalli and many others. It provides a unique insight into the history of the Coachella Valley music scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nRipped from the DVD with Handbrake using the recommended settings for DVD ripping","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971ba85637605cc66bd5f50b89304828565dac7e","amp;dn":"Lo+Sound+Desert+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971ba85637605cc66bd5f50b89304828565dac7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,27,168,86,55,96,92,198,107,213,245,11,137,48,72,40,86,93,172,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
