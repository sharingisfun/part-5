Fortunately, Burton has his veteranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s benefits, for neural damage he suffered from implants during his time in the USMCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite Haptic Recon force. Then one night Burton has to go out, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a job heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to doÃ¢â‚¬â€a job Flynne didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know he had. Beta-testing part of a new game, he tells her. The job seems to be simple: work a perimeter around the image of a tower building. Little buglike things turn up. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to get in their way, edge them back. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all there is to it. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offering Flynne a good price to take over for him. What she sees, though, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what Burton told her to expect. It might be a game, but it might also be murder.\n\n\n\nPraise for The Peripheral\n\n&quot;Spectacular, a piece of trenchant, far-future speculation that features all the eyeball kicks of Neuromancer and all the maturity and sly wit of Spook Country. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Cory Doctorow\n\n\n\nPraise for William Gibson\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“To read Gibson is to read the present as if it were the future.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Ã¢â‚¬Å“GibsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radar is deftly tuned to the changes in the culture that many of us are missing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Ã¢â‚¬Å“One of the most visionary, original, and quietly influential writers currently working.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The Boston Globe Ã¢â‚¬Å“Like Pynchon and DeLillo, Gibson excels at pinpointing the hidden forces that shape our world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Details\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nWilliam Gibson is the author of Neuromancer, Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, Virtual Light, Idoru, All TomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Parties, Pattern Recognition, Spook Country, Zero History, and Distrust That Particular Flavor.
