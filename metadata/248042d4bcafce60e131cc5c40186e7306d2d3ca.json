Using a single acoustic guitar to create drum sounds, bass lines and melodies simultaneously, his songs draw on a range of influences and styles including blues, soul, rock and even metal. Michael Hedges is an important source of inspiration. To date he has two solo albums, with a third currently in development, and has toured full-time since 2004. He is often a member of the &quot;Guitar Masters tour&quot;, alongside its founder Preston Reed and Andy McKee.\n\n\nBuy music on http://jongomm.com/store\n\nVisit http://jongomm.com/home\n\n\n\nTorrent file contains:\n\n\n2004 - Hypertension\n2009 - Don't Panic\n2012 - Singles - Video rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:248042d4bcafce60e131cc5c40186e7306d2d3ca","amp;dn":"Jon+Gomm+Discography+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"248042d4bcafce60e131cc5c40186e7306d2d3ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,128,66,212,188,175,206,96,225,49,204,92,64,24,110,115,6,210,211,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
