The two computers don't even have to be the same type, so for example you can use VNC to view a Windows Vista desktop at the office on a Linux or Mac computer at home. For ultimate simplicity, there is even a Java viewer, so that any desktop can be controlled remotely from within a browser without having to install software.\n\nFEATURES:\nCross-platform remote control\nVNC authentication\n128-bit AES encryption\nSystem authentication\nOptimized performance\nPrinting\nFile transfer\nChat\nDedicated support channel\n256-bit AES encryption\nSingle sign-on authentication\nPowerful deployment tool\nLow cost, discounts for volume\nFor personal and commercial use\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d0be6ea90543a17b74a9a4435b6146533ddce6","amp;dn":"RealVNC+Enterprise+Edition+5.0.1+%2B+key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d0be6ea90543a17b74a9a4435b6146533ddce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,208,190,110,169,5,67,161,123,116,169,164,67,91,97,70,83,61,220,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
