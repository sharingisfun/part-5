A young turk from the provinces who made his mark in Paris, he promoted his image as a gregarious outsider, passionate, physically robust, and profoundly ambitious. Drawing inspiration from natural motifs, Courbet reset the course of French painting to embrace immediacy, vitality, and painterly self-expression. \n\nCourbet and the Modern Landscape accompanies the first major museum exhibition to address the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary achievement in the genre of landscape painting. The book illustrates a highly selective group of landscapes from 1855 to 1877, most of them from the 1860s, when Courbet discovered in the countryside of his native Franche-ComtÃƒÂ© and on the shores of the Normandy coast a consistently rich source of visual stimulation. Many of the paintingsÃ¢â‚¬â€from collections in Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â€will be new to general readers of art history, and their juxtaposition will be a revelation to both experts and amateurs alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662cb0541d5ff743a8ed4ee9698553c8c92bc4c5","amp;dn":"Courbet+and+the+Modern+Landscape+%28Art+Ebook+Painting%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662cb0541d5ff743a8ed4ee9698553c8c92bc4c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,44,176,84,29,95,247,67,168,237,78,233,105,133,83,200,201,43,196,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
