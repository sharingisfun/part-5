The group's origins lie with Bill and Bob, who as children began their singing careers covering Everly Brothers hits. Given guitars by their father, Navy man William &quot;Bud&quot; Cowsill, the siblings soon recruited younger brothers Barry and John to play bass and drums, respectively, and as Beatlemania dawned, the teen foursome began performing live at school dances and church socials throughout their native Newport, RI. Soon, the Cowsills landed a regular weekend gig at the local club Bannisters Wharf, and in 1967 recorded the single &quot;All I Really Wanta Be Is Me&quot; for the Joda label. The record generated little response, however, and after an appearance on NBC's The Today Show, the group signed to Mercury Records, where they issued three more singles to negligible interest.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Most Of All\n02.The Rain, The Park &amp; Other Things\n03.We Can Fly\n04.In Need Of A Friend\n05.Indian Lake\n06.Poor Baby\n07.Hair\n08.The Prophecy Of Daniel &amp; John The Divine (Six-Six-Six)\n09.Silver Threads And Golden Needles\n10.II X II\n11.Love American Style\n12.When Everybody's Here (Bill Cowsill)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a251abdfa1e31c6391b256805cf68e4df1edb25d","amp;dn":"The+Cowsills+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282001+320+vtwin88cub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a251abdfa1e31c6391b256805cf68e4df1edb25d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,81,171,223,161,227,28,99,145,178,86,128,92,246,142,77,241,237,178,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
