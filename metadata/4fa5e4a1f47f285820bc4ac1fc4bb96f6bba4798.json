In this course you'll learn how to create and configure different types of maps, how to attach events to these maps, and how to create and customize markers. You'll tap into some of the more powerful services that Google provides, such as geocoding, and then abstract all of this out into your own custom library. By the end of this course, you'll be able to take the library you create and apply it to your own applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fa5e4a1f47f285820bc4ac1fc4bb96f6bba4798","amp;dn":"Tutsplus+-+Custom+Interactive+Maps+With+the+Google+Maps+API","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fa5e4a1f47f285820bc4ac1fc4bb96f6bba4798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,165,228,161,244,127,40,88,32,188,74,193,252,75,185,111,107,186,71,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
