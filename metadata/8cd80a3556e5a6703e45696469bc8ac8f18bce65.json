But Andrew Newberg, M.D., and Mark Robert Waldman have discovered a powerful strategy called Compassionate Communication that allows two brains to work together as one.\n\nIn twelve clear steps, Compassionate Communication actually changes the brain structure of both participants in a way that helps establish a mutual bond. Free from conflict and distrust, we can communicate more effectively, listen more deeply, and collaborate without effort. Outlining the science, the strategies, and the practical application of Compassionate Communication in a range of personal and professional settings, Newberg and Waldman prove that words can change your brain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd80a3556e5a6703e45696469bc8ac8f18bce65","amp;dn":"Words+Can+Change+Your+Brain+-+Andrew+Newberg+and+Mark+Robert+Wal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd80a3556e5a6703e45696469bc8ac8f18bce65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,216,10,53,86,229,166,112,62,69,105,100,105,188,138,200,241,139,206,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
