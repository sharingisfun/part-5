Also lacking is public intelligence in the sense of decision-support: knowing what one needs to know in order to make honest decisions for the good of all, rather than corrupt decisions for the good of the few.\n\nThe Open-Source Everything Manifesto is a distillation of author, strategist, analyst, and reformer Robert David Steele life's work: the transition from top-down secret command and control to a world of bottom-up, consensual, collective decision-making as a means to solve the major crises facing our world today. The book is intended to be a catalyst for citizen dialog and deliberation, and for inspiring the continued evolution of a nation in which all citizens realize our shared aspiration of direct democracyÃ¢â‚¬â€informed participatory democracy. Open-Source Everything is a cultural and philosophical concept that is essential to creating a prosperous world at peace, a world that works for one hundred percent of humanity. The future of intelligence is not secret, not federal, and not expensive. It is about transparency, truth, and trust among our local to global collective. Only &quot;open&quot; is scalable.\n\nAs we strive to recover from the closed world corruption and secrecy that has enabled massive fraud within governments, banks, corporations, and even non-profits and universities, this timely book is a manifesto for liberationÃ¢â‚¬â€not just open technology, but open everything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd915febff55574b2284c3fd749385826c35bf47","amp;dn":"Open-Source+Everything+Manifesto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd915febff55574b2284c3fd749385826c35bf47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,145,95,235,255,85,87,75,34,132,195,253,116,147,133,130,108,53,191,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
