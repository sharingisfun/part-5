At the time of this recording Parker had just returned from recuperating in a mental hospital in California and was, surprisingly, playing better than ever. Here, on tracks like &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; &quot;Hot House&quot; and &quot;Dizzy Atmosphere,&quot; Parker's soulful, dazzlingly mercurial lines animate the space they occupy like strings of fire. Especially prominent is the dialogue Parker establishes with drummer Max Roach, the two of them seeking out the hidden rhythms of each song - horn, snare and cymbal creating new shifting structures inside the standard 4/4 time signature.\n \nSound quality issues aside, BIRD ON 52ND ST. is essential for collectors and a fine example of Bird's conceptual and technical fluency on stage.\n \nThis is Charlie Parker relaxed and mellow, telling his story over a dozen or more choruses, displaying a sense of humor broader than the (generally) more cerebral and cosmic humor that came out of the strict studio environment.\n\n\n\nCD / 1994 / Ã¢â‚¬Å“Restored and RemasteredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n1 52nd Street Theme 2:17 \n2 Shaw 'Nuff 1:31 \n3 Out of Nowhere 3:02 \n4 Hot House 2:14 \n5 This Time the Dream's On Me 2:20 \n6 A Night in Tunisia 3:27 \n7 My Old Flame 3:22 \n8 52nd Street Theme 1:02 \n9 The Way You Look Tonight 4:41 \n10 Out of Nowhere 2:33 \n11 Chasin' the Bird 1:45 \n12 This Time the Dream's On Me 3:28 \n13 Dizzy Atmosphere 2:56 \n14 How High the Moon 3:37 \n15 52nd Street Theme 1:15\n\n\n\nPersonnel: \nCharlie Parker, alto saxophone\nMiles Davis, trumpet\nDuke Jordan, piano\nTommy Potter, bass\nMax Roach, drums\n\n\n\nRecorded in New York in 1948.  \n\n\n\nChasing the bird.\n\n:)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14cebb300ee293f0ecc6571c595e0414fb35a4a4","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+-+Bird+on+52nd+ST.+%2F+1948","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14cebb300ee293f0ecc6571c595e0414fb35a4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,206,187,48,14,226,147,240,236,198,87,28,89,94,4,20,251,53,164,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
