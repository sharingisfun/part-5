By exploring the subject through its 50 key insights - from the simple (the number one) and the subtle (the invention of zero) to the sophisticated (proving Fermat's last theorem) - this book shows how mathematics has changed the way we look at the world around us.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9add913876ac39d554eee6db8f97e90e7d48596f","amp;dn":"50+Mathematical+Ideas+You+Really+Need+to+Know+by+Tony+Crilly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9add913876ac39d554eee6db8f97e90e7d48596f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,221,145,56,118,172,57,213,84,238,230,219,143,151,233,14,125,72,89,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
