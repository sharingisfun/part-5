Robert Ben Garant and Thomas LennonÃ‚â€™s movies have made over a billion dollars at the box officeÃ‚â€” and now they show you how to do it yourself! This book is full of secret insider information about how to conquer the Hollywood studio system: how to write, pitch, structure, and get drunk with the best of them. Well . . . maybe not the best of them, but certainly the most successful. (If youÃ‚â€™re aiming to win an Oscar, this is not the book for you!) But if you can type a little, and can read and speak EnglishÃ‚â€”then you too can start turning your words into $TACK$ OF MONEY! This is the only screenwriting book you will ever need. Because all other ones pretty much suck. In these pages, Garant and Lennon provide the kind of priceless tips you wonÃ‚â€™t find anywhere else, including: Ã‚â€¢ THE ART OF PITCHING Ã‚â€¢ GETTING YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR Ã‚â€¢ TAKING NOTES FROM MOVIE STARS Ã‚â€¢ HOW TO GET FIRED AND REHIRED Ã‚â€¢ HOW TO GET CREDIT AND ROYALTIES! AND MOST IMPORTANT: WHAT TO BUY WITH THE HUGE PILES OF MONEY YOUÃ‚â€™RE GOING TO MAKE! Writing Movies for Fun and Profit will take you through the highs and lows of life as a professional screenwriter. From the highs of hugging Gisele BÃƒÂ¼ndchen and getting kung fu punched by Jackie Chan to the soul-crushing lows of Herbie: Fully Loaded. READ THIS BOOKÃ‚â€”and youÃ‚â€™ll have everything you need to make your first billion the old-fashioned wayÃ‚â€”by Ã‚â€œselling outÃ‚â€ in show business! A portion of the authorsÃ‚â€™ proceeds from this book are being contributed to the USO of Metropolitan Washington, a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to serving active duty military members and their families in the greater Washington, D.C., region.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf1f3b022e0ee6696f95d58d4320788d9c5edc1","amp;dn":"Writing+Movies+for+Fun+and+Profit+-+Thomas+Lennon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cf1f3b022e0ee6696f95d58d4320788d9c5edc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,241,243,176,34,224,238,102,150,249,93,88,212,50,7,136,217,197,237,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
