The all-male asylum is based upon the old Pendleton, Oregon asylum (now the Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution). With little medical oversight, the hospital ward is run by the buttoned-up, middle-aged Nurse Ratched (or &quot;the Big Nurse&quot;) and her orderlies, whom the Chief describes as resentful black men.\n\nPlease seed 1:1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04992b8dd5c5bc9fefb5003f90855a7848754bf0","amp;dn":"Ken+Kesey+-+One+Flew+Over+The+Cuckoo%5C%27s+Nest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04992b8dd5c5bc9fefb5003f90855a7848754bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,153,43,141,213,197,188,159,239,181,0,63,144,133,90,120,72,117,75,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
