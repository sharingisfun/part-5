It was released on April 4, 2014 in Europe, and on April 8, 2014 in North America.\n\nThe album features guest appearances from Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy, ex-The Agonist), Marco Hietala (Nightwish, Tarot) and George Oosthoek (ex-Orphanage).Background\n\nAccording to lead singer Charlotte Wessels, the album's title was inspired by Octavia E. Butler's science fiction trilogy Lilith's Brood. 'The Human Contradiction' refers to humans in general being highly intelligent and hierarchically structured at the same time. The songwriting, however, was not influenced by Lilith's Brood but continues the theme of being different that was portrayed by Delain's previous album We Are the Others. It charted at number 25 on the Official Album Charts in their native country of Netherlands, as well as charting at number 44 on the Official Album Charts in the United Kingdom.\nReception\nProfessional ratings\nGood Stuff\n\nA joint review by 10 Sonic Seducer writers found that The Human Contradiction was a well-produced gothic metal album oriented towards Within Temptation, but without any new impulses. A reviewer for the Decibel magazine wrote, too, that the album contained nothing new, but was well crafted. According to Metal Hammer Germany, The Human Contradiction was in fact different than other releases by Delain in that it contained a tiny musical allowing Charlotte Wessels to present the full range of her voice. The reviewer noted though that the album was &quot;too hard for sophisticated pop, [and] too shallow to have any rocking depth.&quot; Matt Farrington for All About The Rock said &quot;It would be nice to see them pushing the boundaries more to see what else can be delivered. That said it would be a tough task for them to deliver a better record than April Rain back in 2009&quot;.\nTrack listing\n\nAll lyrics written by Charlotte Wessels, all music composed by Guus Eikens, Charlotte Wessels and Martijn Westerholt (except where noted).\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Here Come the Vultures&quot;   \t06:05\n2. \t&quot;Your Body Is a Battleground&quot; (featuring Marco Hietala) \t03:50\n3. \t&quot;Stardust&quot;   \t03:57\n4. \t&quot;My Masquerade&quot;   \t03:43\n5. \t&quot;Tell Me, Mechanist&quot; (featuring George Oosthoek) \t04:52\n6. \t&quot;Sing to Me&quot; (featuring Marco Hietala) \t05:09\n7. \t&quot;Army of Dolls&quot;   \t04:57\n8. \t&quot;Lullaby&quot;   \t04:56\n9. \t&quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; (featuring Alissa White-Gluz) \t04:31\nTotal length:\n\t41:56 \t\nDigipak Bonus Disc \t\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n10. \t&quot;Scarlet&quot;   \t  \t4:36\n11. \t&quot;Don't Let Go&quot;   \t  \t3:56\n12. \t&quot;My Masquerade (Live from the My Masquerade concert, Haarlem 08/11/2013)&quot;   \t  \t5:02\n13. \t&quot;April Rain (Live from the My Masquerade concert, Haarlem 08/11/2013)&quot;   \tMartijn Westerholt, Charlotte Wessels \t4:45\n14. \t&quot;Go Away (Live from the My Masquerade concert, Haarlem 08/11/2013)&quot;   \tMartijn Westerholt, Guus Eikens, Charlotte Wessels \t3:42\n15. \t&quot;Sever (Live from the My Masquerade concert, Haarlem 08/11/2013)&quot;   \tMartijn Westerholt \t4:54\n16. \t&quot;Stay Forever (Live from the My Masquerade concert, Haarlem 08/11/2013)&quot;   \tMartijn Westerholt, Ronald Landa, Charlotte Wessels \t4:31\n17. \t&quot;Sing to Me (Orchestra Version)&quot;   \t  \t3:41\n18. \t&quot;Your Body Is a Battleground (Orchestra Version)&quot;   \t  \t3:20\nTotal length:\n\t38:32 \t\nSeed if you get ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54ef3937f144a6d7f72a92bee0dd84f50d3b9b30","amp;dn":"Delain+-+The+Human+Contradiction++mp3+320k+a2k+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54ef3937f144a6d7f72a92bee0dd84f50d3b9b30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,239,57,55,241,68,166,215,247,42,146,190,224,221,132,245,13,59,155,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
