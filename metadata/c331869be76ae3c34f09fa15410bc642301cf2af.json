Given that White Wolf sued its own fanclub without second thoughts, I figure I've got  maybe three months before they send vampires to eat my soul, so I'm kicking into overdrive.\n\nThis is an anime RPG. IT is better than BESM by any fair contest. Better than randomanime? I have no clue; I haven't played it. Whatever. If you like P+P games, and/or you like anime, then download it.\n\nThe homepage is www.wiseturtle.com\n\nNext realease: Exalted corebook + all the other Exalts and the Fair Folk. I'm forced to use the retarded quadrapalegic of the file sharing world: eDonkey. Hooray for 9 bits of download after 20+ hours in queues.\n\nYou guys are going to owe me your freaking souls when this is done.\n\nIncidently, I just got VII.I'll add it to the nWoD torrent when I'm done seeding this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c331869be76ae3c34f09fa15410bc642301cf2af","amp;dn":"Open+Versatile++Anime+RPG+%28OVA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c331869be76ae3c34f09fa15410bc642301cf2af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,49,134,155,231,106,227,195,79,9,250,21,65,11,198,66,48,28,242,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
