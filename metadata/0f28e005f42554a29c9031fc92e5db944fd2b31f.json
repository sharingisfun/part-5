Based on the wildly popular comic book series Hellblazer from DC Comics, seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine is armed with a ferocious knowledge of the dark arts and a wickedly naughty wit.

With his soul already damned to hell, he's decided to abandon his campaign against evil until a series of events thrusts him back into the fray when an old friend's daughter becomes the target of supernatural forces.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f28e005f42554a29c9031fc92e5db944fd2b31f","amp;dn":"Constantine.S01E01.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f28e005f42554a29c9031fc92e5db944fd2b31f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,40,224,5,244,37,84,162,156,144,49,252,146,229,219,148,79,210,179,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
