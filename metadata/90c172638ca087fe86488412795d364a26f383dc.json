It follows the career of the British MI6 spy Magnus Pym from his early days as a schoolboy to his eventual disappearance as a suspected agent of the Czech secret service.\n\n\nA Perfect Spy is the tale of Magnus Pym, a long-time spy for the United Kingdom. After attending his father's funeral, Pym mysteriously disappears. His fellow secret agents (not unreasonably) suspect he might have betrayed them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ throughout most of his career, Magnus worked for the Czechoslovak secret service. Although intrigue, wit, and suspense compose the novel, the story of Magnus Pym is partly an unadorned recollection of Magnus' childhood and memories of his father Rick Pym.\n\nFile list:\n\nA Perfect Spy 1x01 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.avi 523.09 MB\nA Perfect Spy 1x01 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.srt 42.02 KB\nA Perfect Spy 1x02 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.avi 520.63 MB\nA Perfect Spy 1x02 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.srt 45.94 KB\nA Perfect Spy 1x03 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.avi 527.49 MB\nA Perfect Spy 1x03 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.srt 46.18 KB\nA Perfect Spy 1x04 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.avi 532.72 MB\nA Perfect Spy 1x04 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.srt 43.50 KB\nA Perfect Spy 1x05 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.avi 557.89 MB\nA Perfect Spy 1x05 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.srt 49.68 KB\nA Perfect Spy 1x06 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.avi 515.77 MB\nA Perfect Spy 1x06 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.srt 40.82 KB\nA Perfect Spy 1x07 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.avi 497.15 MB\nA Perfect Spy 1x07 DVDrip Dual Eng Spa.srt 36.05 KB\n\n\nAnother contribution by the author who wrote tinker tailor soldier spy and the rest of the Karla trilogy.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90c172638ca087fe86488412795d364a26f383dc","amp;dn":"A+Perfect+Spy+-+John+le+Carre++%28BBC+1987+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90c172638ca087fe86488412795d364a26f383dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,193,114,99,140,160,135,254,134,72,132,18,121,93,54,74,38,243,131,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
