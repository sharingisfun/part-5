The song is an acoustic guitar driven ballad which tells of the end of a romance. The song is noted for its poignant lyrics concerning lost love and the grieving involved. Singer Mick Jagger gives a wrenching performance for the recording, while Stones-recording regular Nicky Hopkins plays the song's distinctive piano chords. The strings on the piece (as well as &quot;Winter&quot;) were arranged by Nicky Harrison.\nReleased as a single in August 1973, &quot;Angie&quot; went straight to the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and reached number five on the UK singles chart.\n\nLyrics:\n\nAngie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear?\nAngie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?\nWith no loving in our souls and no money in our coats\nYou cant say were satisfied\nBut angie, angie, you cant say we never tried\nAngie, youre beautiful, but aint it time we said good-bye?\nAngie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried?\nAll the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke\nLet me whisper in your ear:\nAngie, angie, where will it lead us from here?\nOh, angie, dont you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet\nI hate that sadness in your eyes\nBut angie, angie, aint it time we said good-bye?\nWith no loving in our souls and no money in our coats\nYou cant say were satisfied\nBut angie, I still love you, baby\nEverywhere I look I see your eyes\nThere aint a woman that comes close to you\nCome on baby, dry your eyes\nBut angie, angie, aint it good to be alive?\nAngie, angie, they cant say we never tried","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94109a7fcff9fe917ea62dfbe91c2dc3925ab526","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Angie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94109a7fcff9fe917ea62dfbe91c2dc3925ab526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,16,154,127,207,249,254,145,126,166,45,251,233,28,45,195,146,90,181,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
