The South Carolina musician spent much of his career traveling with medicine shows and made only a handful of recordings. They offer a a rich sampling of his delightfully diverse repertoire of folk songs, blues, and rags. It is on such plaintive, rhythmically compelling performances that his considerable reputation stands.\n\nPink Anderson: Vol. 1 Carolina Bluesman\nRecorded: 12 April  1961 in Spartanburg, South Carolina by Samuel Charters\nReleased: 1961\nPink Anderson, vocals, guitar\nLabel: Prestige/Bluesville\n\nTracklist:\n01 - My Baby Left Me This Morning\n02- Baby, Please Don't Go\n03- Mama Where Did You Stay Last Night\n04- Big House Blues\n05- Meet Me In The Bottom\n 06- Weeping Willow Blues\n07- Baby I'm Going Away\n08- Thousand Woman Blues\n09- I Had My Fun\n10- Every Day In The Week\n 11- Try Some Of That [Bonus  CD Track ]\n\n \nPink Anderson: Vol. 2 Medicine Show Man\nLabel: Prestige/Bluesville\nRecorded: 1961 by Samuel Charters\nReleased:1962\nPink Anderson, vocals, guitar\n\n Tracklist:\n01- I Got Mine\n02- Greasy Greens\n03- I Got A Woman 'Way Cross Town\n04- Travelin' Man\n05- Ain't Nobody Home But Me \n06- That's No Way To Do\n07- In The Jailhouse Now\n08- South Forest Boogie\n09- Chicken\n10- I'm Going To Walk Through the Streets Of...\n\n \nThe Blues Of Pink Anderson: Ballad &amp; Folksinger, Vol. 3\nRecorded: 14 August 1961 in Spartanville, South Carolina by Samuel Charters\nReleased: 1963\nPink Anderson, vocals, guitar\n\n \nTracklist:\n01- The Titanic\n02- Boweevil\n03- John Henry\n04- Betty And Dupree \n05- Sugar Babe\n06- The Wreck Of The Old 97\n07- I Will Fly Away\n08- The Kaiser (The Boys Of Your Uncle Sam)\n09- In The Evening\n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fbccf8fd9aff4c852200a83a3cd9c7436a819ae","amp;dn":"Pink+Anderson+Vol+1%2C2%2C3+%28blues%29+%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fbccf8fd9aff4c852200a83a3cd9c7436a819ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,188,207,143,217,175,244,200,82,32,10,131,163,205,156,116,54,168,25,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
