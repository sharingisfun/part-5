There are distractions from the drama with a full day of outdoor activities. The women become true City Slickers when they try their hand at fly fishing, skeet-shooting and repelling, but when it's Kristen's turn to descend down the mountain, things get tense. The ladies come together for a modern day treasure hunt called Geocaching, only to splinter apart again when a beer-lubricated Heather gets on Kristen's last nerve. Old friends Kristen and Heather square off in the most unexpected tiff of the season.
