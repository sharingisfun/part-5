Auer\t\r\n\r\nCast:\r\nGig Young\r\nMala Powers\r\nWilliam Talman\r\nEdward Arnold\r\nChill Wills\r\nMarie Windsor\r\nPaula Raymond\r\nOtto Hulett\r\nWally Cassell\r\nRon Hagerthy\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Auer directed and Steve Fisher wrote this police procedural film in the vein of the popular Detective Story of two years earlier. The film juggles around four characters through a particularly bad night in a Chicago precinct -- Johnny Kelly (Gig Young), a stressed out cop ready to crack; Sally &quot;Angel Face&quot; Connors (Mala Powers), a cheap strumpet lounge singer; Hayes Stewart (William Talman), a former magician and present thug; Penrod Biddel (Edward Arnold), a smooth and corrupt district attorney; and Sgt. Joe (Chill Wills), an Everyman character, known as &quot;The Voice of Chicago.&quot; The skimpy plot concerns Kelly, who is having an affair with Angel Face and is ready to quit his job and leave his wife Kathy (Paula Raymond) at the drop of a hat. In order to get quick money to escape Chicago and start life anew with Angel Face, Kelly accepts an assignment and a payment from Biddel to escort low-life Stewart across the state line. ~ Paul Brenner, All Movie Guide\r\n\r\nNot my rip, thanks to the original uploader!\r\n\r\nName                        City That Never Sleeps.1953.John H Auer.mkv\r\n\r\nSize                        4.37 GiB\r\nDuration                    01:30:53\r\n\r\nVideo track\r\nCodec ID                    V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nResolution                  960 x 720\r\nFrame aspect ratio          4:3 = 1.333333\r\nPixel aspect ratio          1:1 = 1\r\nDisplay aspect ratio        4:3 = 1.333333\r\nFramerate                   23.976024 fps\r\nBit rate \t            6 113 Kbps\r\nBPP\t                    0.369\r\n\r\nAudio track\r\nCodec ID                    A_DTS\r\nSampling frequency          48000 Hz\r\nChannels                    1\r\nBitstream type (bs)         DTS\r\nBitrate (bs)                768 kbps CBR\r\nSampling frequency (bs)     48000 Hz\r\nMode (bs)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c70879a00234e0f9bc36a91ab8bdad817fe749f","amp;dn":"City+That+Never+Sleeps.1953.John+H+Auer.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c70879a00234e0f9bc36a91ab8bdad817fe749f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,112,135,154,0,35,78,15,155,195,106,145,171,139,218,216,23,254,116,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
