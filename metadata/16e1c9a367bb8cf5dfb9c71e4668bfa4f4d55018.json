They are the fruits from a tree whose roots reach so deep into the soil that it is tapping into a pure, unspoiled well. Albums that sound abnormal compared to the rest of the bushels of genetically enhanced crops are a rare treat. After digesting these tasty morsels of sonics, you wonder if you could ever go back to consuming the old genetic monstrosities again.\nSouthern California indie folk group Run River North have planted a musical seed in especially fertile ground and has sprouted a self-titled debut that taps into the roots of traditional folk blended with a grand, ensemble sound. The six-piece band gained notoriety after producing a music video for, &quot;Fight To Keep,&quot; entirely in their Honda Fit, Accord, and CRV, a move that garnered attention from Honda Motor Company. As a result, in 2012, the band was surprised with an invitation to perform on Jimmy Kimmel Live. In 2013, the group was signed by Nettwerk Records, home to top artists such as fun.\nThe aforementioned &quot;Fight To Keep&quot; is vicious, as aptly portrayed in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official music video, which premiered on Conan O'Brien's Team Coco website in January. Starting out docile, it gradually builds into a rowdy tune that shows its teeth in a gnashing, grinding fashion. This is what Run River North do so well; making a cohesive, orchestral sound that sneaks up on the listener before it overpowers them. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lying BeastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ exhibits the same attributes with a soft introduction, lulling the song into a safe place before rapidly increasing the pressure.\nAnother common thread on this album is its mirror effect among two pairs of tracks. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lying BeastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“FoxbeardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are so eerily similar that they could be twins. Both songs utilize the same formula from beginning to end: a soft, solemn, deep opening progressing to a grand, all-encompassing finale. The opening track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Monsters Calling HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the closing number Ã¢â‚¬Å“BannerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bookend this album by utilizing an inverse effect. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Monsters Calling HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a prime example of the deep harmony, led by vocalist Alex Hwang, which is synonymous with Run River North and their ace in the hole moving forward. The opener announces this albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence with authority, while the closer brings the album down for a soft landing after a great, tension inducing crescendo.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“BeetleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a terror-filled tune that launches into a panic as it awakens drenched in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“cold and empty sweat.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Folksy with a classical edge, the tension is heightened with the effective violin play, tightening the binds around this song. The pins and needles are abundant on this lively track.\nWhat all of these songs on this album have in common are an apparent cohesiveness. Nothing sounds contrived or half-baked. Listen no further than the deep harmonies produced in every chorus. Each is so hearty, serene, and triumphant that is sounds effortless.\nComposed of an orchestral sensibility, this debut relies on the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strength as skilled musicians blending together to make an incredible noise. Oftentimes, folk acts try to make due with grit and ragged edges to give themselves a level of credibility in the genre. Run River North are far too skilled to pander to demands for raw, rambling racket. From the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“play,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ this album sounds too authentic to be real. However, play after play reveals and exceptionally strong album. Accept no imitations.\nReview by Travis Boyer\nRate 8/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n01. Monsters Calling Home 04:11\n02.
