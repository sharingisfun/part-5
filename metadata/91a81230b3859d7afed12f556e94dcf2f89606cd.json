FraserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time-travelling wife, Claire, also knows a couple of things: that the Americans will win, but that the ultimate price of victory is a mystery. What she does believe is that the price wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t include JamieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life or happiness Ã¢â‚¬â€ not if she has anything to say.\n\nClaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grown daughter Brianna, and her husband, Roger, watch the unfolding of BriannaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ history Ã¢â‚¬â€ a past that may be sneaking up behind their own family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a81230b3859d7afed12f556e94dcf2f89606cd","amp;dn":"An+Echo+in+the+Bone+%28Outlander%2C+%237%29+-+Diana+Gabaldon.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a81230b3859d7afed12f556e94dcf2f89606cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,168,18,48,179,133,157,122,254,209,47,85,110,148,220,242,248,150,6,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
