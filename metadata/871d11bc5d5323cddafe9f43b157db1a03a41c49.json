He dares to question the image of male-as-oppressor, arguing that this misconception has hindered not only men, but women as well.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nDr. Warren Farrell (1943-present) is an American author of seven books on women and men's issues. His books are published in more than fifty countries, and in fifteen languages. His books &amp; contributions cover twelve fields : history, law, sociology and politics (The Myth of Male Power); couples communication (Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say); economic and career issues (Why Men Earn More); child psychology and child custody (Father and Child Reunion); and teenage to adult psychology and socialization, (Why Men Are the Way they Are and The Liberated Man). All of his books contribute to women and men's studies and critique the image of the sexes in the media. For example, about his most recent book, Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?, the publisher, Oxford University Press states &quot;A perfect book to get students thinking and debating... ideal for courses in gender studies, sociology, psychology, economics, feminist philosophy, and contemporary moral issues.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_Of_Male_Power&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_Of_Male_Power&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Myth-Male-Power-Warren-Farrell/dp/0425181448/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224393334&amp;sr=8-1\n\nNOTE: You may need to crank the volume up a bit to hear the audio book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:871d11bc5d5323cddafe9f43b157db1a03a41c49","amp;dn":"The+Myth+of+Male+Power+%5BAudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"871d11bc5d5323cddafe9f43b157db1a03a41c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,29,17,188,93,83,35,205,218,254,159,67,177,87,219,26,3,164,28,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
