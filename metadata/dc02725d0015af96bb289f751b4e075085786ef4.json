The album was recorded at Massey Hall in Toronto on June 11 through 13 during their 2112 tour. Similar to a lyric in the track &quot;Limelight&quot; from 1981's album Moving Pictures, the title of this album alludes to William Shakespeare's play As You Like It.\n\nThis performance of &quot;2112&quot; omits the &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Oracle: The Dream&quot; sections of the studio recording. The final 32 seconds of &quot;Discovery&quot; are played as a lead-in to &quot;Presentation,&quot; but the liner notes do not indicate this. Rush would not perform the entire suite live until the 1996-97 Test for Echo Tour, as documented on the live album Different Stages.\n\nThe medley on track 9 is marked as below on the album but runs as follows: &quot;Working Man (first half)/Finding My Way/Working Man (second half)/Drum Solo&quot; before jamming out the end of the medley.\n\nFollowing along at the end of the last song the album closes with a bit of post-show chatter among the band members and the sound of a slamming of a door as they leave the venue.\n\nAll The World's A Stage was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the &quot;Sector&quot; box set\n\nAll The World's A Stage [2011 Remaster] [320k MP3]\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01. \t&quot;Bastille Day&quot;   \t4:57\n02. \t&quot;Anthem&quot;   \t4:56\n03. \t&quot;Fly by Night/In the Mood&quot; (Lee; Peart/Lee) \t5:03\n04. \t&quot;Something for Nothing&quot; (Lee, Peart) \t4:02\n05. \t&quot;Lakeside Park&quot;   \t5:04\n06. \t&quot;2112\n         I.
