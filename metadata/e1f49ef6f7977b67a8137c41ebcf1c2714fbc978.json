A No. 7 platinum hit, the record was their first in a string of hit albums and singles that continued uninterrupted for three years. The single &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, backed with &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot;, reached No. 2 on the national Billboard chart. The former would eventually become the group's most-covered song, with some 100 cover versions by other artists to date, including a hit version in 1971 by Ike &amp; Tina Turner. John Fogerty cites this song as being the result of high spirits on gaining his discharge from the Army Reserve. The album also featured a remake of the rock &amp; roll classic &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; and the band's nine-minute live-show closer, &quot;Keep On Chooglin'&quot;.\n\nWeeks later, in March 1969, &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; backed with &quot;Lodi&quot; was released and peaked at No. 2. The band's third album, Green River, followed in August 1969 and went gold along with the single &quot;Green River&quot;, which again reached No. 2 on the Billboard charts. The B-side of &quot;Green River&quot;, &quot;Commotion&quot;, peaked at No. 30 and the band's emphasis on remakes of their old favorites continued with &quot;Night Time Is the Right Time&quot;.\n\nCCR continued to tour incessantly with performances at the Atlanta Pop Festival and Woodstock. Their set was not included in the Woodstock film or soundtrack because John Fogerty felt the band's performance was subpar. (Several tracks from the event were eventually included in the 1994 commemorative box set.) Stu Cook, however, held an opposing view, saying &quot;The performances are classic CCR and I'm still amazed by the number of people who don't even know we were one of the headliners at Woodstock '69.&quot; The band complained that they had to take the stage at three in the morning because the Grateful Dead had jammed so far past their scheduled time that by the time CCR began playing, many in the audience had gone to sleep.Or were trippin so hard that they thought the Dead were still performing.\n \n        Born on the Bayou\n        Green River\n        Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won't Do)\n        (Wilson Pickett cover)\n        Commotion\n        Bootleg\n        Bad Moon Rising\n        Proud Mary\n        I Put a Spell on You\n        (Screamin' Jay Hawkins cover)\n        Night Time Is the Right Time\n        (Roosevelt Sykes cover)\n        Keep On Chooglin'\n        Encore:\n        Susie Q\n        (Dale Hawkins cover)\nGood times  now I got to find seeders for this classic rip,seeders where you at?
