(Soviet Union: Russian title)\nThe Irony of Fate, or Sauna Blues (English DVD title)\na.k.a. The Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath! (informal English title)\nDirector: Eldar Ryazanov\n\nIMDb User rating: 8.7/10\n\nDVD Rip with English subtitles\n\nThis movie is a true Russian cult classic.  It has been a tradition to see this movie on  New Years Eve for the last 30+ years.\nIt is a great story that combines elements of subtle satire, romance, and at times laugh-outloud comedy into a farcical love triangle.\n\nIf you didn't know that the Russians could do satire, you have to see this film, which is an irreverent look at all the mass-production and lack of individuality which went with the Communist system and which form the basis for the series of misunderstandings which would be impossible elsewhere. A genuine love story, loads of fun as well and the most stunning views of St Petersburg in the Winter. There's a lot of dialogue, so your Russian needs to be up to scratch if you see it in the original, and it's a long film but worth every minute. The quality of translation offered by the subtitles is truly superb, provide translation is provided not only of the dialogue, but of the songs as well.  The songs are an important part of narration, not just there for a backdrop. The song lyrics and the poetry are by some of the most prominent Russian poets of the Silver Age and are just plain beautiful. In short this an amazing film, one of those that can be watched over and over.\n\nThe acting is great as well. Andrei Myagkov delivers a character who undergoes significant, yet somehow believable transformation from a shy, nerdy young doctor to a bold, at times arrogant, yet at the same time romantic man. A great comic performance by Yuri Yakovlev, as the jealous fiance of the heroine, alone makes the film worth watching, to the last moments.\n\n- - - -\nTruly wonderful, and with universal appeal, 4 January 2006\nAuthor: Witold Brostow from Denton, Texas\n\nLet me sort out what in this film is Soviet, what is Russian, and what is universal.\n\nSoviet is the background, including the cartoon which precedes the appearance of humans: a man with a tube kills any architect originality, even so innocent as balconies. As a consequence, the same buildings are put up in Artica as well in a southern desert before surprised camels. The Soviet reality is the basis of the plot with identical buildings in different cities. Also the New Year tree rather that the Christmas tree is Soviet. However, as the story unfolds, the Soviet reality recedes into little visible background. An exception is a line in one of the songs: if you do not have a dog, your neighbor cannot poison your dog.\n\nRussian are the beautiful poems which are made into songs. There are also some views of Leningrad, but actually only a few, with the St. Isaac Basilica shown several times from different sides.\n\nThe cast and the technical crew are largely Russian, but not only. Obviously Armenian, Georgian and Jewish names are listed. The actress playing Nadya has been imported from Central Europe; Barbara Brylska is a Polish actress, well known also from a number of other movies made in Poland as well as in other countries.\n\nThe appeal of the film is truly universal ! This is the reason why viewers from countries so disparate as Latvia, Ukraine and China like this film so much (not to mention Texans). The love-jealousy quadrangle, two mothers, friends of Zhenya and colleagues of Nadya could have lived in many countries around the world. Even the story of the same address could have happened for instance in Germany where practically every city and town has Bahnhofstrasse and Poststrasse.\n\nFinally, the atmosphere of this film is unique - a word which very rarely can be used discussing films. We have seen other films directed by Eldar Ryazanov, all of them good, but none comparable to this one. All that takes place in the film is plausible, it could have happened in reality. At the same time, there is the feeling of poetic, unreal and sublime. These two basically opposed reactions to the film coexist somehow in the viewer; this simply does not happen in movies, films directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski excepted. Irony of the Fate is a truly wonderful film, alive 30 years after being created; it will enchant future generations as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df2ba5788330a0acd2bd833b8857aa1c6230d3a4","amp;dn":"The+Irony+of+Fate%2C+or+Sauna+Blues+%5B1975%5D+USSR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df2ba5788330a0acd2bd833b8857aa1c6230d3a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,43,165,120,131,48,160,172,210,189,131,59,136,87,170,28,98,48,211,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
