Whether they will ever team again is unknown. But with Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood Live From Madison Square Garden, fans everywhere are able to experience the sound and the glory of a performance on that famous stage by two of rock's greatest artists.\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:993aa8775eafb784e4047c01adf36aa6b2bf1348","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+%26+Steve+Winwood+-+Live+From+Madison+Square+Garden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"993aa8775eafb784e4047c01adf36aa6b2bf1348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,58,168,119,94,175,183,132,228,4,124,1,173,243,106,166,178,191,19,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
