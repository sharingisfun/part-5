Iyer's two previous releases were attempts to integrate the avant-garde,\nSouth Asian, and M-Base concepts that shaped him as a player and composer. On\nPanoptic Modes, Iyer continues to do this, but manages to arrive at the next\nlevel in terms of artistic focus and vision. With this new quartet music (three\ntracks are trio pieces), he continues to eschew the rhythmically obvious at all\ncosts. His harmonic and formal concepts are as challenging as ever, yet his\nexceedingly difficult writing is rendered oddly accessible by the unperturbed\nfacility of his band. Highlights include the brisk, rolling rhythms and animated\npiano/drum conversation heard on &quot;Configurations&quot;; the highly angular\njuxtaposition of melody and bassline on &quot;Atlantean Tropes&quot;; the dark, suggestive\nworld of the anti-death penalty ballad &quot;Numbers,&quot; which lasts not even two\nminutes; and the stirring quartet remake of &quot;Trident&quot; (a far slower trio version\nappeared on Iyer's 1998 record, Architextures). Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62d0298b20f96fd415ff1526e291b7137a3ac789","amp;dn":"Vijay+Iyer+-+Panoptic+Modes+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62d0298b20f96fd415ff1526e291b7137a3ac789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,208,41,139,32,249,111,212,21,255,21,38,226,145,183,19,122,58,199,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
