There was more to come: the new social studies textbook\nWorld of Mankind. Published by Follett, this book instructed the teacher how to instill\nhumanistic (no right/no wrong) values in the KÃ¢â‚¬â€œ3 students. At the textÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suggestion the\nteacher was encouraged to take little tots for walks in town during which he would point\nout big and small houses, asking the little tots who they thought lived in the houses: Poor\nor Rich? Ã¢â‚¬Å“What do you think they eat in the big house? ...in the little house?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ When I\ncomplained about this non-educational activity at a school board meeting I was dismissed\nas a censor and the press did its usual hatchet job on me as a misguided parent. A friend of\nmineÃ¢â‚¬â€a very bright gal who had also lived abroad for yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€told me that she had overheard\ndiscussion of me at the local co-op. The word was out in town that I was a Ã¢â‚¬Å“kook.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That was\nnot a Ã¢â‚¬Å“positive response/rewardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for my taking what I believed to be a principled position.\nSince I had not been Ã¢â‚¬Å“trained,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I was just mad!\nNext stop on the road to becoming a Ã¢â‚¬Å“resisterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was to become a member of the school\nphilosophy committee. Our Harvard-educated, professional change agent superintendent gave\nall of the committee members a copy of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Philosophy of EducationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1975 version) from\nthe Montgomery County schools in Maryland, hoping to influence whatever recommendations\nwe would make.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b42942a8740334c901cd87c5757413e06054a639","amp;dn":"The+Deliberate+Dumbing+Down+of+America+A+Chronological+Paper+Tra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b42942a8740334c901cd87c5757413e06054a639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,41,66,168,116,3,52,201,1,205,135,197,117,116,19,224,96,84,166,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
