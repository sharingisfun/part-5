It was the most publicized of Dream Theater's albums since Awake, debuting on the Billboard charts at No. 46 and the Billboard Internet charts at No. 1. \r\n\r\nThe subsequent world tour included a select few special &quot;album cover&quot; gigs ,in which they played Metallica's Master of Puppets in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThroughout their career, Dream Theater's live shows have gradually become bigger, longer, and more diverse. Prior to Portnoy's departure, Dream Theater &quot;rotated&quot; its set lists to ensure that fans who attended multiple shows in the same area will not see too many (or any) songs repeated. Portnoy, who constructed the set lists, would take into account the set list from the last time the band was in a particular city for the benefit of fans who saw the band on successive tours.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2002\r\n\r\nStyle:\tProgressive Metal\r\n\r\nAdditional:\tThrash Metal\r\nCountry:\tUSA\r\n\r\nFormat:\tmp3\r\nSize:\t111 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t01/24/2016 \r\nFiles:\t12\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLength:0:57:48\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n01.
