Much of the story centers on the daring deejay&amp;#039;s attempts to put on the very first live rock &amp; roll stage show at the Paramount Theatre in Brooklyn. To do this he must overcome the protests of concerned and angry parents, conservatives, and local police. Several performers of the era appear in the film including Chuck Berry, and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n \nSongs included:\n\nHot Wax Theme        \nRock &amp; Roll Is Here to Stay        \nMr. Lee        \nMaybe        \nHey Little Girl        \nReelin&amp;#039; and Rockin&amp;#039;        \nRoll over Beethoven        \nWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?        \nThat Is Rock &amp; Roll        \nI Put a Spell on You        \nMr. Blue        \nWhole Lotta Shakin&amp;#039; Going On        \nGreat Balls of Fire        \nSweet Little Sixteen        \nThat&amp;#039;s Why        \nSincerely        \nThere Goes My Baby        \nHushabye        \nRave On        \nStay        \nTutti Frutti        \nZoom        \nLittle Star        \nWhen You Dance        \nSplish Splash        \nSea Cruise      \nGoodnight, It&amp;#039;s Time to Go    \n\nRipped from a VERY RARE commercial video cassette that was only issued for a few months in the early 80&amp;#039;s.\nPerhaps the music rights have held this film from re-release?\n\nCAST:\n\n \nTim McIntire  - Alan Freed  \nFran Drescher  - Sheryl  \nJay Leno  - Mookie  \nLaraine Newman  - Teenage Louise  \nCarl Earl Weaver  - Chesterfield  \nAl Chalk  - Chesterfield  \nSam Harkness  - Chesterfield  \nArnold McCuller  - Chesterfield  \nJeff Altman  - Lennie Richfield  \nMoosie Drier  - Artie Moress  \nChuck Berry  - Himself  \nJerry Lee Lewis  - Himself  \nKenny Vance  - Prof. La Piano  \nTom Baker  - Vinnie (Promo Man)  \nOlivia Barash  - Susie  \nHamilton Camp  - Louie Morgan  \nMelanie Chartoff  - Debbie  \nCameron Crowe  - Delivery Boy  \nKeene Curtis  - Mr. Leonard  \nWee Willie Davis  - Freed&amp;#039;s Friend  \nNora Denney  - Louise&amp;#039;s Mom  \nJoe Esposito  - Pianotone  \nFil Formicola  - Man Singing in the Hallway  \nGarry Goodrow  - Louise&amp;#039;s Dad  \nLarry Hankin  - Diamond&amp;#039;s Manger  \nJo Ann Harris  - Timmy and the Tangerine  \nJohn Hawker  - Janitor  \nScreamin&amp;#039; Jay Hawkins  - Himself  \nJohnny Haymer  - Song Plugger  \nMichael Heit  - Mr. Morris (Manager)  \nCharles Irwin  - Timmy and the Tangerine  \nBobby Johnson  - Tap Dancer  \nArnold Johnson  - Arnold (Musician in Bar)  \nJohn Lehne  - D.A.
