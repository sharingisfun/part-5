Don Van Vliet (christened Captain Beefheart by one-time colleague Frank Zappa) and The Magic Band rehearsed this record for over a year, translating Beefheart&amp;#039;s ideas into fully fleshed-out pieces: although the record on first listen appears spontaneous and improvised, it is in fact carefully constructed, as the instrumental versions on the Grow Fins box-set demonstrate. Trout Mask Replica fuses blues, freeform jazz, rock, and Beefheart&amp;#039;s surreal lyrics into an initially perplexing and daunting blend, in which the two guitars, drums and bass of10 seem to be playing four different songs at once--but over time, the music&amp;#039;s angular, discordant shapes and rhythms not only begin to make sense, but take on an eccentric beauty. For those unfamiliar with Beefheart&amp;#039;s work, check out the definitive compilation The Dust Blows Forward, or start with the luminously remastered Safe As Milk and Mirror Man. Both are essential records, but the man&amp;#039;s mythical reputation begins and ends with the legacy of Trout Mask Replica. --Burhan Tufail \n \n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee4b77a873c021f3bf2ca6e85431ec6ce6d19e43","amp;dn":"Captain+Beefheart+%26+The+Magic+Band-Trout+Mask+Replica-1969-mp3%403","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee4b77a873c021f3bf2ca6e85431ec6ce6d19e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,75,119,168,115,192,33,243,191,44,166,232,84,49,236,108,230,209,158,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
