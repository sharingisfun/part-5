Farfisa organ, gloriously fuzzy guitars, and rattlesnake percussion (plus occasionally the obligatory sitar and trippy backwards tapes) support Watson\\'s deliciously whiny vocals, but this is no mere period recreation. Unlike a lot of contemporary artists who try to work in this style, Watson doesn\\'t forget what made the best psych-pop singles work so well: strong melodies and immediate hooks. Songs like the \\&quot;Itchykoo Park\\&quot;-like music hall amble \\&quot;Sunny Day\\&quot; and the statement of intent \\&quot;We Are the Orange Alabaster Mushroom\\&quot; capture the listener through their unabashed catchiness. Leaning more toward the fanciful side of British psychedelia than the comparatively drab San Francisco style (much more Syd Barrett than Grace Slick), this is an utterly charming collection likely to delight any psych-pop fan. Space and Time was originally released as an LP in 2000. The 2001 CD reissue by Hidden Agenda includes three previously unheard tracks, including the exceedingly trippy \\&quot;Sydney\\'s Electric Headcheese Sundial,\\&quot; the Orange Alabaster Mushroom\\'s first-ever recording. \n\nTracks\n\t1\tYour Face Is In My Mind\t\t\t\n\t2\t(We Are) The Orange Alabaster Mushroom\t\t\t\n\t3\tTree Pie\t\t\t\n\t4\tCrazy Murray\t\t\t\n\t5\tAnother Place\t\t\t\n\t6\tRainbow Man\t\t\t\n\t7\tEthel Tripped a Mean Gloss\t\t\t\n\t8\tValerie Vanillaroma\t\t\t\n\t9\tSpace And Time\t\t\t\n\t10\tSlug\t\t\t\n\t11\tSunny Day\t\t\t\n\t12\tAim the Vimana Toward the Dorian Sector\t\t\t\n\t13\tMister Day\t\t\t\n\t14\tGone\t\t\t\n\t15\tSydney\\'s Electric Headcheese Sundial\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62460c09ff475e25dfe355feed71354a10a0c9c","amp;dn":"The+Orange+Alabaster+Mushroom-+Space+and+Time%3A+A+Compendium","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d62460c09ff475e25dfe355feed71354a10a0c9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,36,96,192,159,244,117,226,93,254,53,95,238,215,19,84,161,10,12,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
