Based on new evidence culled from brain-scan studies, a wide-reaching survey of peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s religious and spiritual experiences, and the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ analyses of adult drawings of God, neuroscientist Andrew Newberg and therapist Mark Robert Waldman offer the following breakthrough discoveries:\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Not only do prayer and spiritual practice reduce stress, but just twelve minutes of meditation per day may slow down the aging process.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Contemplating a loving God rather than a punitive God reduces anxiety and depression and increases feelings of security, compassion, and love.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fundamentalism, in and of itself, can be personally beneficial, but the prejudice generated by extreme beliefs can permanently damage your brain.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Intense prayer and meditation permanently change numerous structures and functions in the brain, altering your values and the way you perceive reality.\n\nBoth a revelatory work of modern science and a practical guide for readers to enhance their physical and emotional health, How God Changes Your Brain is a first-of-a-kind book about faith that is as credible as it is inspiring.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8963345281bb7464b4ea931ab20186f6d96de979","amp;dn":"How+God+Changes+Your+Brain%3A+Breakthrough+Findings+from+%5BiDeusEx%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8963345281bb7464b4ea931ab20186f6d96de979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,99,52,82,129,187,116,100,180,234,147,26,178,1,134,246,217,109,233,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
