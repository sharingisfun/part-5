A. Lafferty Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thirteen books. All pdf format.\n\nThe files in this torrent are all new or reprocessed scans. All but one of the books are out-of-print; many are now hard to find and quite expensive. I believe the only Lafferty still in-print is Okla Hannali; even when new editions are published, such as the new multi-volume edition of Lafferty's collected short stories, they go out of print instantly.\n\nLafferty wrote many more books than the thirteen here, but most of the books in this torrent were at one time relatively easy to obtain. Many other Lafferty books were published only in limited editions, and it's said that Lafferty wrote a great deal that remains unpublished. These thirteen can, then, perhaps be considered a Lafferty &quot;taster,&quot; something to tide you over until the world rediscovers Lafferty's genius.\n\nIf you want to know where to start with Lafferty, Michael Swanwick suggested Nine Hundred Grandmothers.\n\n\nPast Master (1968)\nThe Reefs of Earth (1968)\nSpace Chantey (1968)\nFourth Mansions (1969)\nNine Hundred Grandmothers (1970) (short stories)\nThe Devil Is Dead (1971)\nArrive at Easterwine (1971)\nStrange Doings (1972) (short stories)\nOkla Hannali (1972)\nDoes Anyone Else Have Something Further to Add? (1974) (short stories)\nNot to Mention Camels (1976)\nAurrelia (1982)\nAnnals of Klepsis (1983)\n\n\nAbout the author:\n\nRaphael Aloysius Lafferty (1914-2002) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer known for his original use of language, metaphor, and narrative structure, as well as for his etymological wit.\n\nLafferty's quirky prose drew from traditional storytelling styles, largely from the Irish and Native American, and his shaggy-dog characters and tall tales are unique in science fiction. Little of Lafferty's writing is considered typical of the genre. His stories are closer to tall tales than traditional science fiction and are deeply influenced by his Catholic beliefs; Fourth Mansions, for example, draws on The Interior Mansions of Teresa of Avila.\n\nHis writings, both topically and stylistically, are not easy to categorize. Plot is frequently secondary to other elements of Lafferty's writing; while this style has resulted in a loyal cult following, it causes some readers to give up attempting to read his work.\n\nLafferty was nominated for Hugo and Nebula awards numerous times, but won only once, a Hugo for &quot;Eurema's Dam&quot; in 1973.\n\nNeil Gaiman once wrote of Lafferty:\n\n&quot;There was a writer from Tulsa, Oklahoma ... who was, for a little while in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the best short story writer in the world. His name was R. A. Lafferty, and his stories were unclassifiable and odd and inimitable -- you knew you were reading a Lafferty story within a sentence.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13fa4cdfacaa21c7ee05c14e196512e0c8251f1c","amp;dn":"R.+A.+Lafferty+-+Science+Fiction+Novels+and+Stories+%2813+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13fa4cdfacaa21c7ee05c14e196512e0c8251f1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,250,76,223,172,170,33,199,238,5,193,78,25,101,18,224,200,37,31,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
