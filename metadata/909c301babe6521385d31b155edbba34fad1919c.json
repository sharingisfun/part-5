I have downloaded and installed this and it works fine. Just copy the contents of the crack folder into install directory. When it asks for a username / reg code or password just input anything and click okay.\n\nMake sure you configure your site URL and you have to configure mail settings as well. This program is capable of generating an email account but I think it works best if you use a throwaway Hotmail or similar.\n\nYou can input for auto capatcha solving which makes this program work a lot faster, but even entering in capatchas manually isn't too bad.\n\nDoesn't run in socket mode, go to options to configure how many windows or threads you want to run.\n\nWhen you start the program it will create profiles for you for the sites you have selected and then you can leave your backlink, which is all done automatically. Pretty quick way to get backlinks.\n\nFor best use add sites to the list so you create profiles to unique sites you can do all this and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909c301babe6521385d31b155edbba34fad1919c","amp;dn":"Rank+Leap+Pro+v+1.0.05+seo+automation+software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909c301babe6521385d31b155edbba34fad1919c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,156,48,27,171,230,82,19,133,211,27,21,94,219,186,52,250,209,145,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
