(NAA) build 300 Curtiss P-40s for the R.A.F. Had Ã¢â‚¬Å“DutchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kindelberger, NAAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s President agreed to this, what is generally considered to be the greatest piston engine fighter aeroplane ever built would have never been created. Instead, NAA counter offered that they could produce a superior aeroplane to the P-40 and agreed to do it in 120 days. 102 days later the first Mustang airframe was completed, and 47 days after that the first Mustang flew. It went on to serve in every theatre of the War and in every Allied air force. A total of 16,766 were built, making it the most numerous American fighter aircraft. Because of the great care and attention to aerodynamic detail that went into its brilliant design, the Mustang was, from its inception, one of the fastest single-engine piston aeroplanes of the W.W. II era.\n\nThe Wings of POWER 3: P-51 FEATURES:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢The worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most iconic WWII fighter aircraft\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢As with every A2A aircraft, it is gorgeously constructed, inside and out, down to the last rivet.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Designed and built to be flown &quot;By The Book&quot;.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Custom Cockpit Systems and Gauges.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Visual Real-Time Load Manager, with the ability to load fuel and stores in real-time.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Naturally animated pilot.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢3D Lights 'M' (built directly into the model) with under-wing landing light than can be turned on, deployed, and retracted and fully functional recognition lights.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Pure3D Instrumentation now with natural 3D appearance with exceptional performance.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Sound engineered by A2A sound professionals.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Oil pressure system models oil viscosity (oil thickness).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Authentically modeled pneumatic system.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢In cockpit pilot's map for handy in-flight navigation.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Auto-Mixture that actually performs as intended. Now you can set for Ã¢â‚¬Å“RUN&quot; and the aircraft fuel-to-air ratio will be automatically determined and set by the carburetor based upon various factors, such as altitude.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Dual speed, dual stage Supercharger modeled with accurate behavior.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fuel delivery system simulated.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢All models include A2A specialized materials with authentic metal.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Pilot's Notes pop-up 2D panel keeps important information easily available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a256e3a536c7a86bb46b4ba2792dd475979f3a66","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+A2A+Simulations+P-51+with+Accusim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a256e3a536c7a86bb46b4ba2792dd475979f3a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,86,227,165,54,199,168,107,180,107,75,162,121,45,212,117,151,159,58,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
