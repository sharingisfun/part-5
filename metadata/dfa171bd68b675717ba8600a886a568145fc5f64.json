It contains short clear articles on all the grammatical problems which regularly cause difficulty to foreign learners. In addition, it deals with selected points of vocabulary, idiom, style, pronunciation and spelling. The main differences between British and American usage are also dealt with. Each entry contains an explanation of a problem, examples of correct usage, and - when this is useful - examples of typical mistakes.\n\nSpecial features of this book include:\n- simple and practical presentation\n- alphabetical arrangement of numbered entries\n- detailed index and cross-reference system\n- distinction between formal and informal usage\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa171bd68b675717ba8600a886a568145fc5f64","amp;dn":"Practical+English+Usage+-+Michael+Swan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa171bd68b675717ba8600a886a568145fc5f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,161,113,189,104,182,117,113,123,168,96,10,136,106,86,129,69,252,95,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
