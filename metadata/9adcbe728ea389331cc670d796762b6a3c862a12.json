The game is currently in alpha and contains a wide range of single player content including:\n\n    A creative mode allowing you to push your designs to the limit and ensure the total annihilation of your opponents.\n    A campaign waged over hundreds of islands against eight unique factions.\n    A Story Mode where you can (eventually!) play 15 missions as each of the eight factions - a fantastic mixture of strategy, design and wild battles! Defend your fleet against waves of enemy forces in a series of extremely tough challenges that unlock new components. \n\nAn expansive multiplayer and co-op element is planned for the coming months!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9adcbe728ea389331cc670d796762b6a3c862a12","amp;dn":"From+the+Depths+v1.761","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9adcbe728ea389331cc670d796762b6a3c862a12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,220,190,114,142,163,137,51,28,198,112,215,150,118,43,106,60,134,42,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
