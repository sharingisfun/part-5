Hour-long original airings appear as one file, as per the DVD listing.\n\nThe picture quality of the original DVDs are of aged quality because the source (original televisions series) was videotaped, as opposed to filmed. Therefore, instead of concentrating on Blu-Ray-type specifications, I concerned myself with storage. Each season fits nicely on a single-layer disc.&quot;\n\nEPISODE LIST:\n\nS01E01 - Pilot.avi\nS01E02 - Pilot, Pt. 2.avi\nS01E03 - Les on a Ledge.avi\nS01E04 - Hoodlum Rock.avi\nS01E05 - Hold-Up.avi\nS01E06 - Bailey's Show.avi\nS01E07 - Turkeys Away.avi\nS01E08 - Love Returns.avi\nS01E09 - Mama's Review.avi\nS01E10 - A Date with Jennifer.avi\nS01E11 - The Contest Nobody Could Win.avi\nS01E12 - Tornado.avi\nS01E13 - Goodbye Johnny.avi\nS01E14 - Johnny Comes Back.avi\nS01E15 - Never Leave Me, Lucille.avi \nS01E16 - I Want to Keep My Baby.avi\nS01E17 - A Commercial Break.avi\nS01E18 - Who is Gordon Sims.avi\nS01E19 - I Do, I Do...
