Fitzgerald's time on the Verve label would see her produce her most highly acclaimed recordings, at the peak of her vocal powers. This album inaugurated Fitzgerald's Songbook series, each of the eight albums in the series focusing on a different composer of the canon known as the Great American Songbook. Fitzgerald's manager, (and the producer of many of her albums), Norman Granz, visited Cole Porter at the Waldolf-Astoria, and played him this entire album. Afterwards, Porter merely remarked, &quot;My, what marvellous diction that girl has&quot;.\n\n[size=4][color=deepskyblue]Frank Devol backs Ella with a 1940s-style big band with enough modernist, Atomic Age elements tossed in to stop it from being just an empty exercise in nostalgia. Fitzgerald finds the perfect marriage between mainstream pop and jazz singing -- her harmonic improvisations are extraordinary. A real treat.\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01. All Through The Night (3:19)\n02.
