It has the Accusim 1.2 update. Seed it because I will have to free up my bandwidth for subsequent uploads.\n\nI am seeing a lot of requests for titles I have, but I can't keep up with all the torrents' comments. If you post in my thread or send me a PM there is a much better chance what you want will get made into a torrent.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit my thread in the Suprbay forums. There you can see the latest news, drop a comment and use the private message system to contact me directly. That forum has a rating system similar to the quality field found at the top of all torrents. Perhaps you'd like to say hi or show your support.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=113113&amp;pid=709028#pid709028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=113113&amp;pid=709028#pid709028&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b19aa93cc80e439eeaf344f803d70a935deaa6","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+A2A+Simulations+P-40+with+Accusim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35b19aa93cc80e439eeaf344f803d70a935deaa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,177,154,169,60,200,14,67,158,234,243,68,248,3,215,10,147,93,234,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
