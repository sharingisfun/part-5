These trains were a vital cog in the military machine from carrying troops, to moving hospitals, to being transformed into actual weapons. In this compelling series we tell the stories of these incredible trains...\r\nWe combine expert interviews, authentic reconstruction, engineering graphics and archive, highlighting the extraordinary human stories alongside the engineering detail and military perspective. The stories are dramatic, exciting and filled with fascinating historical detail. Each of these incredible stories is set against a backdrop of conflict and we put the events into context. In addition to the stories of the trains we learn more about the military, political and domestic battles happening at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6)  Secrets and Lies \r\nThe strategic importance of trains has resulted in many elaborate schemes and methods being devised to destroy them. Historian Neil Faulkner tells the story of Lawrence of Arabia and his pioneering guerrilla warfare against the railways of the Ottoman Empire. We track down a train used by the SOE in the Second World War to teach their agents how to de-rail locomotives. Under New York's Grand Central Terminal are two railway secrets: rusting in a siding is President Roosevelt's personal train that brought him secretly into the city, and a generator called M42 that its claimed Nazi spies tried to destroy in the Second World War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Combat-Trains-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 1666 Kbps\r\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 8\r\n * Part Size: 518 MB\r\n * Source: PDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1918/combat-trains-the-death-railway","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac2e5ff8d459ace7a0cec1590ae0f2309c38f1ed","amp;dn":"Combat+Trains+6of8+Secrets+and+Lies+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac2e5ff8d459ace7a0cec1590ae0f2309c38f1ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,46,95,248,212,89,172,231,160,206,193,89,10,224,242,48,156,56,241,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
