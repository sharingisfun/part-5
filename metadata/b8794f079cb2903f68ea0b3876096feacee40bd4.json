A specialist encrypter is attacked by thugs with orders from an unknown source, is chased by invisible predators, and dates an insatiably hungry librarian who never puts on weight. In the End of the World a new arrival is learning his role as dream-reader. But there is something eerily disquieting about the changeless nature of the town and its fable-like inhabitants. Told in alternate chapters, the two stories converge and combine to create a novel that is surreal, beautiful, thrilling and extraordinary.\n\n\n\nRead by Adam Sims, Ian Porter\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8794f079cb2903f68ea0b3876096feacee40bd4","amp;dn":"Haruki+Murakami+-+Hard-boiled+Wonderland+and+the+End+of+the+Wor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8794f079cb2903f68ea0b3876096feacee40bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,121,79,7,156,178,144,63,104,234,11,56,118,9,111,234,206,228,11,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
