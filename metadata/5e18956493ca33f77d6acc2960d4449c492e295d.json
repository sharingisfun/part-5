For example, using sex, food, or hostility to relieve tension--that's a defense--catalogued here as entry number 68: Impulsivity. Screaming at someone can be a defense. \n\nPlaying golf can be a defense. So can saving money. Or at least all of these activities may involve defenses. In this book, Blackman catalogs 101 defenses--the most ever compiled--with descriptions practical for use in everyday assessment and treatment of psychopathology. He explains how to detect and interpret a defense and offers supportive therapy techniques. The many practical tips interspersed throughout this text make it an excellent reference tool for students and experienced clinicians, while the user-friendly features allow all readers to experience how psychological defenses operate in everyday life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e18956493ca33f77d6acc2960d4449c492e295d","amp;dn":"101+Defenses%3A+How+the+Mind+Shields+Itself","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e18956493ca33f77d6acc2960d4449c492e295d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,24,149,100,147,202,51,247,125,106,204,41,96,212,68,156,73,46,41,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
