The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\nGiant Steps is a 1960 studio album by jazz musician John Coltrane, released on Atlantic Records.\n\nGiant Steps was his second album to be recorded by the Atlantic label, and marked the first time that all of the pieces on a recording had been composed by him. The recording exemplifies Coltrane\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s melodic phrasing that came to be known as sheets of sound, and features the use of a new harmonic concept now referred to as Coltrane changes. Jazz musicians continue to use the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Giant Steps\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; chord progression, which consists of a peculiar set of chord progressions which often move in thirds, as a practice piece and as a gateway into modern jazz improvisation. The ability to play over the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Giant Steps\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;/Coltrane cycle remains to this day one of the benchmark standards by which a jazz musician\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s improvising skill is measured.\n\nThe album is also considered to be Coltrane\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s farewell to bebop. He ventured into the territory of modal jazz shortly afterwards.\n\nSeveral pieces on this album went on to become jazz standards, such as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Naima\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Giant Steps\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Cousin Mary\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Countdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Mr. P.C.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\n\n\n Reception\n\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Core Collection\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; calling it \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Trane\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first genuinely iconic record.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;[1] In 2003, the album was ranked number 102 on Rolling Stone magazine\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2004, it was one of fifty recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.\n\n\nAll tracks composed by John Coltrane.\n\nSide one\n\n   1. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Giant Steps\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n   2. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Cousin Mary\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n   3. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Countdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:21\n   4. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Spiral\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:56\n\nSide two\n\n   5. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Syeeda\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Song Flute\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:00\n   6. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Naima\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n   7. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Mr. P.C.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (Mr. Paul Chambers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:57\n\nAdditional takes first released on Alternate Takes, 1974\n\n   8. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Giant Steps\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n   9. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Naima\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n  10. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Cousin Mary\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:54\n  11. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Countdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n  12. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Syeeda\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Song Flute\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:02\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:044dc591ad6f1fb84ff893d94e4c5933d79b6dad","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Giant+Steps+-+%28+320+%29+-+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"044dc591ad6f1fb84ff893d94e4c5933d79b6dad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,77,197,145,173,111,31,184,79,248,147,217,78,76,89,51,215,155,109,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
