What it is and isn't (and there is still uncertainty as to what it really is). He does the same for meditation, although it's much briefer. Based on his research, he concludes that hypnosis and meditation are both process and states of awareness in that they represent unusual and different phenomena.\n\nIf you are only interested in the history and evolution of hypnosis, this book is an easy and enjoyable read (includes an extensive bibliography). However, if you are looking for guidance on how to use hypnosis, hypnosis scripts, specific interventions, etc.; this is not the book for you, as these are not included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb1b75d4cded5278f304d50470dc94237f3e8073","amp;dn":"Meditation+and+Hypnosis.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb1b75d4cded5278f304d50470dc94237f3e8073","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,27,117,212,205,237,82,120,243,4,213,4,112,220,148,35,127,62,128,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
