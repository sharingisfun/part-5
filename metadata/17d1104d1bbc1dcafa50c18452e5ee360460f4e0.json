He was awarded the Georg BÃƒÂ¼chner Prize in 1967 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972 &quot;for his writing which through its combination of a broad perspective on his time and a sensitive skill in characterization has contributed to a renewal of German literature.&quot;\n\nHe served for several years as the president of PEN International and was a leading defender of the intellectual freedom and human rights of writers worldwide.  When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet Union, he first took refuge in BÃƒÂ¶ll's Eifel cottage.  In 1976, BÃƒÂ¶ll demonstratively left the Catholic church, &quot;without falling away from the faith.&quot;\n\nBÃƒÂ¶ll's work has been translated into more than 30 languages and he remains one of Germany's most widely-read authors.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB or PDF format as indicated:\n\n* BILLIARDS AT HALF-PAST NINE (Melville House, 2010).
