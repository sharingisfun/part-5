Forgas, &quot;The Psychology of Social Conflict and Aggression&quot;\n2011 | ISBN: 1848729324 | 342 pages | PDF | 4,7 MB\n\nThis book provides an up-to-date integration of some of the most recent developments in social psychological research on social conflict and aggression, one of the most perennial and puzzling topics in all of psychology. It offers an informative, scholarly yet readable overview of recent advances in research on the nature, antecedents, management, and consequences of interpersonal and intergroup conflict and aggression. The chapters share a broad integrative orientation, and argue that human conflict is best understood through the careful analysis of the cognitive, affective, and motivational processes of those involved in conflict situations, supplemented by a broadly-based understanding of the evolutionary, biological, as well as the social and cultural contexts within which social conflict occurs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e5a227e08c15a9a4ce1e03b6bb110b51f4af3da","amp;dn":"The+Psychology+of+Social+Conflict+and+Aggression","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e5a227e08c15a9a4ce1e03b6bb110b51f4af3da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,90,34,126,8,193,90,154,76,225,224,59,107,177,16,181,31,74,243,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
