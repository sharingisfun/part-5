The Swedish Academy noted that &quot;her magnificent epic writing has, in the words of Alfred Nobel, been of very great benefit to humanity.&quot;  Apart from the Nobel Prize, she was the recipient of prestigious literary awards in South Africa, Europe, and the U.S., including a number of annual CNA Literary Awards in South Africa, the W.H. Smith Literary Award, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the Booker Prize and the Grand Aigle d'Or.  In 2007 Gordimer was awarded the French Legion of Honour.\n\nHer work has been described as &quot;history from the inside&quot;, dealing with moral and racial issues, particularly the devastating impact of apartheid on the lives of all South Africans.  Through her novels, short stories, and essays, Gordimer revealed the prejudices and ideologies, the tensions and stresses of life in a racially divided society and the corrupting and corrosive effects of the apartheid system.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n    == Novels &amp; Short Stories ==\n\n* BEETHOVEN WAS ONE-SIXTEENTH BLACK &amp; OTHER STORIES (Penguin, 2007)\n\n* BURGER'S DAUGHTER (Penguin, 1980) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* THE CONSERVATIONIST (Penguin, 1978) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* GET A LIFE (Bloomsbury, 2005) -- ePUB\n\n* A GUEST OF HONOUR (Penguin, 1973)\n\n* THE HOUSE GUN (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1998) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* JULY'S PEOPLE (Viking / Jonathan Cape, 1981) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* JUMP &amp; OTHER STORIES (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux / Bloomsbury, 1991) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* LIFE TIMES: Stories, 1952-2007 (Penguin, 2011) -- ePUB\n\n* LIVINGSTONE'S COMPANIONS: Stories (Viking, 1971)\n\n* LOOT &amp; OTHER STORIES (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2003)\n\n* MY SON'S STORY (Penguin, 1991) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2012) -- ePUB\n\n* NONE TO ACCOMPANY ME (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux / Bloomsbury, 1994) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* NOT FOR PUBLICATION &amp; OTHER STORIES (Viking, 1965)\n\n* THE PICKUP (Penguin, 2002)\n\n* A SOLDIER'S EMBRACE: Stories (Penguin, 1982)\n\n* SOMETHING OUT THERE (Penguin, 1985)\n\n* A SPORT OF NATURE (Knopf, 1987)\n\n* WHY HAVEN'T YOU WRITTEN: Selected Stories, 1950-1972 (Penguin, 1992)\n\n* A WORLD OF STRANGERS (Penguin, 1962)\n\n\n    == Essays &amp; Non-fiction ==\n\n* THE ESSENTIAL GESTURE: Writing, Politics &amp; Places (Knopf, 1988).
