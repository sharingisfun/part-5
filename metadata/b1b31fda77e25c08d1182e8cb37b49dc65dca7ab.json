Professor Brian Cox and Professor Jeff Forshaw go on a journey to the frontier of 21st century science to consider the real meaning behind the iconic sequence of symbols that make up EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most famous equation, E=mc2. Breaking down the symbols themselves, they pose a series of questions: What is energy? What is mass? What has the speed of light got to do with energy and mass? In answering these questions, they take us to the site of one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted. Lying beneath the city of Geneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss boarder, is a 27 km particle accelerator, known as the Large Hadron Collider. Using this gigantic machineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which can recreate conditions in the early Universe fractions of a second after the Big BangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Cox and Forshaw will describe the current theory behind the origin of mass.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b31fda77e25c08d1182e8cb37b49dc65dca7ab","amp;dn":"Why+Does+E+%3D+mc2%3F++%3D++Brian+Cox+++%28epub%2Fmobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b31fda77e25c08d1182e8cb37b49dc65dca7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,179,31,218,119,226,92,8,209,24,46,140,179,123,73,220,101,220,167,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
