The goal of the course is to provide enough training in PowerShell fundamentals, language and syntax so that you can be productive and effective in a very short time. The course has many live demonstrations of PowerShell in action from using WMI to query remote machines for management information, running long running tasks as background jobs, creating pipelined expressions and creating simple PowerShell scripts and functions.\n\n\nLessons\nLesson 1: Introduction and Welcome 00:09:44\nLesson 2: The PowerShell Paradigm 00:26:53\nLesson 3: Requirements and Installations 00:15:10\nLesson 4: Using PowerShell Help 00:35:51\nLesson 5: The PowerShell ISE 00:18:42\nLesson 6: PowerShell Providers 00:35:07\nLesson 7: Extending PowerShell 00:18:57\nLesson 8: Understanding the PowerShell Pipeline 01:00:33\nLesson 9: PowerShell Operators 00:39:32\nLesson 10: Arrays and Hash Tables 00:43:25\nLesson 11: Core PowerShell Cmdlets 00:52:20\nLesson 12: Working with Objects 00:47:05\nLesson 13: PowerShell Formatting 00:25:46\nLesson 14: PowerShell Serialization 00:33:12\nLesson 15: PowerShell and Regular Expressions 00:39:43\nLesson 16: PowerShell Background Jobs 00:28:36\nLesson 17: PowerShell Scheduled Jobs 00:24:34\nLesson 18: PowerShell Remoting 00:48:55\nLesson 19: PowerShell and WMI 01:07:35\nLesson 20: PowerShell and CIM 00:46:57\nLesson 21: PowerShell Web Cmdlets 00:28:18\nLesson 22: PowerShell Scripting Basics 00:47:12\nLesson 23: PowerShell Scripts and Functions 00:38:16\nLesson 24: PowerShell Script Error Handling and Debugging 00:51:48\nLesson 25: PowerShell Practicum 00:38:35\nLesson 26: WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Next? 00:15:04\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42f7aaddfabf035a32fe521cc23481b0c61818ce","amp;dn":"TrainSignal+-+PowerShell+v3+Essentials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42f7aaddfabf035a32fe521cc23481b0c61818ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,247,170,221,250,191,3,90,50,254,82,28,194,52,129,176,198,24,24,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
