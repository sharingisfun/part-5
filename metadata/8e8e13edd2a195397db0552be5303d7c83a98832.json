These are not necessarily the same objects that are the most spectacular or intriguing visually. The camera reveals different things and has different requirements. What objects in the sky tonight are large enough, bright enough, and high enough to be photographed? This book reveals, for each month of the year, the choicest celestial treasures within the reach of a commercial CCD camera. Helpful hints and advice on framing, exposures, and filters are included. Each deep sky object is explained in beautiful detail, so that observers will gain a richer understanding of these astronomical objects.\n\nThis is not a book that dwells on the technology of CCD, Webcam, wet, or other types of astrophotography. Neither is it a book about in-depth computer processing of the images (although this topic is included). Detailed discussions of these topics can be found in other publications. This book focuses on what northern latitude objects to image at any given time of the year to get the most spectacular results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e8e13edd2a195397db0552be5303d7c83a98832","amp;dn":"The+100+Best+Targets+for+Astrophotography+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e8e13edd2a195397db0552be5303d7c83a98832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,142,19,237,210,161,149,57,125,176,85,43,229,48,61,124,131,169,136,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
