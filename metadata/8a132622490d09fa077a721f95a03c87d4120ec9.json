The audacious and exquisite Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Name alone features Neil Young and Graham Nash, members of the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Santana and one-time flame Joni Mitchell.\n\nThe second CD takes some liberties with the chronological approach in order to bring some flow to the music Crosby made intermittently in the subsequent three decades, between endless freebase hits, a prison term, liver failure and his downright miraculous recovery. The big surprise provided by these 15 little-heard and critically dismissed tracks is that, during even the worst of times, Crosby was able to come up with songs and vocal arrangements that echoed his halcyon days.\n\nThere are revelations aplenty among the 16 previously unreleased tracks on the third CD. Demos of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Long Time Gone,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  VuÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“TriadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ expose CrosbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wispy, asymmetrical song structures, as well as the degree to which this born collaborator relied on his mates Ã¢â‚¬â€œ notably, fellow genius/fuck-up Stephen Stills Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for the solidity they provided.\nLive renditions of Crosby &amp; NashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Lee ShoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Traction In The RainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1971 are poetically pristine, and a scintillating 2002 workout on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dream For HimÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by CSNY couldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come from 30 years earlier. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a delightful outtake from Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Name Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the wistful, vocally adventurous Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kids And DogsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with heady guitar accompaniment from Jerry Garcia.\nBut the real mindblower is an alternate take of Ã¢â‚¬Â¦NameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cowboy MovieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, in which Crosby sings his ample ass off, clearly inspired by the breathtaking guitar interplay of Garcia and Neil Young, both in absolutely peak form, while Phil Lesh and Mickey Hart manage to keep the roof from blowing off.\n\n\n\n\nDavid Crosby \n\nVoyage\n\n2006\n\nAnthology\n1968 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2004\n\n \n\n3CD Box Set / 2006 / 320Kbps\n\n\nDisc 1 / Essential:\n\n1.
