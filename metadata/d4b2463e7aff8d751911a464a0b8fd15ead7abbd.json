In this new edition, Johnson has updated his argument, Harvey Siegel has contributed a counter-argument and Christopher Winch has provided a foreword and afterword drawing the debates together.The issues debated in this new edition of Teaching Thinking Skills include:Do thinking skills exist?What are the aims of education?Can thinking skill be taught?Are thinking skills transferable?\nTeaching Thinking Skills raises issues not only for those concerned with thinking skills per se but more broadly for those concerned with the role of thinking in professional and vocational activities and with the extent to which abilities are broad or narrow, transferable or non-transferable.
