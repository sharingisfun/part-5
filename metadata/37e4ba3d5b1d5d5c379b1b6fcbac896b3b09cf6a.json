It spawned two Top 40 hits, &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot; and \n&quot;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes&quot; which peaked respectively at #28 the week of August 23, 1969\nand at #21 the week of October 25, 1969, on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The \nalbum itself peaked at #6 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart.\n\nComing on the heels of the Sweet Baby James reissue by Audio Fidelity, the outfit that releases \nlimited edition remastered versions of classic rock albums, is the widely celebrated debut album \nby Crosby, Stills and Nash. Going back about a year earlier than Taylor's breakthrough record, \nCrosby, Stills &amp; Nash also signaled a shift away from the harsher, heavier sound of the late 60s \nand helped establish the template for lighter, more melodic fare that dominated rock for much of \nthe 70s.\n\n\n  01.
