So here it is for the princely sum of fuck all. Enjoy.\n\nAmazon description:\n\nJack Hatfield [yes I know, a very English name for the protagonist of a book written by a Jew who is constantly slagging England off] is a hardened former war correspondent who rose to national prominence for his insightful, provocative commentary. But after being smeared as a bigot and extremist by a radical media watchdog group, he ultimately loses his job and finds himself working in obscurity as a freelance news producer in San Francisco. Hatfield is on a ride-along with the SFPD bomb squad when a seemingly routine carjacking turns deadly, after police find several pounds of military-grade explosives in the jacked car. And when the FBI urges Hatfield to stay out of it, he knows he\\'s onto something big. This event will open up a shadowy trail that leads Hatfield to Tel Aviv, London, Paris, and back again to the United States, where he works with a beautiful and seductive Yemeni intelligence agent and a veteran Green Beret to expose a terrorist group known as the Hand of Allah - and a plot within the highest corridors of power that will make 9/11 look like child\\'s play. In this lightning-paced first thriller, spanning the globe from Europe and Israel to the back alleys of San Francisco\\'s Chinatown, a reporter must make the choice between protecting his own life and investigating a terrorist cell whose goal is nothing less than total political control - no matter what the cost.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Abuse-Power-Michael-Savage/dp/0312651619&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Abuse-Power-Michael-Savage/dp/0312651619&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db28ece9638201c03b0ea0f3b6f0da0537de8426","amp;dn":"Abuse+of+Power+-+Michael+Savage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db28ece9638201c03b0ea0f3b6f0da0537de8426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,40,236,233,99,130,1,192,59,14,160,243,182,240,218,5,55,222,132,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
