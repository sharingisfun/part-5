The story concerns the irrepressible Joao de Deus (played by the director, Joao Cesar Monteiro), an ill-kempt, lusty and none-too-honest resident of Violeta's boarding house, which happens to have yellow walls. Joao, who has no visible means of support, is in his fifties, and is not above cadging money from his 70 year old mother, who still works as a cleaning lady. He has a wistful sort of lust for the young ladies in the boarding house, and gets a kind of thrill when he is permitted to take a bath in their used water. He strikes up a friendship with a slightly stupid girl who is a mite promiscuous, and even has a brief sexual encounter with her himself. Many slightly &quot;off&quot; encounters occur during the remainder of the film, but despite Joao's potentially defeating setback near the end, it appears that it won't be long before he's back in action.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Casa Amarela.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.44 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 57mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 763 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 57mn\n      Bit rate : 1 529 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.400\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.190\n      Stream size : 1.25 GiB (87%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 57mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 224 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 188 MiB (13%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0098175\n\nPortuguese audio; English and Portuguese srt subtitles, English, French, Italian and Portuguese subpack (sub/idx)\n\nJoao Cesar Monteiro - Recordacoes da Casa Amarela [1989]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:283fac811a6b22ed521b1fe3a1c95a0bc123ccb9","amp;dn":"Joao+Cesar+Monteiro+-+Recordacoes+da+Casa+Amarela+%5B1989%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"283fac811a6b22ed521b1fe3a1c95a0bc123ccb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,63,172,129,26,107,34,237,82,27,31,227,161,201,90,11,193,35,204,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
