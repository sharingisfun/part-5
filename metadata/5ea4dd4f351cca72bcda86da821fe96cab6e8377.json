MoRE CoMING SooN. ENJoY!\n\n\n\nV.A. - SHAMANS &amp; POSSESSED\n\n\nThis compelling compilation brings together tracks from a bunch of different \nreleases in Buda Musique's Musique Du Monde series to provide a global, \npan-cultural perspective on traditional shamanic ritual music. Here you'd \ndefinitely find some wild and wonderful examples of musical expression made \nby and for shamans and other &quot;possessed&quot; persons from places as diverse as \nIndonesia, Iran, Siberia, Haiti, Vietnam, Ecuador, Guyana, and Brazil. From \nthe always-incredible Cak chant of Bali to Voodoo frenzies, from the \nanti-suicide ceremony of a Siberian shaman to the hallucinogenically-enhanced \nmouth-bowing of an Amazonian healer, this is both some great listening and a \nfascinating reminder of the universal human desire to transcend this world and \nfind strength and succor in what to some is a very real spiritual realm. Some \nof the selections demonstrate the communal, celebratory energy needed to make \ncontact with spirits, while others seem to derive their power from the depth \nof feeling evident in a singer's solo performance. 11 tracks, 60 minutes, an \nexcellent international &quot;shaman-sampler&quot; indeed.\n\nHiQuality: 320Kbps + Booklet (byAmbroseBierce)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ea4dd4f351cca72bcda86da821fe96cab6e8377","amp;dn":"V.A.+-+SHAMANS+%26+POSSESSED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ea4dd4f351cca72bcda86da821fe96cab6e8377","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,164,221,79,53,28,202,114,188,218,134,218,130,31,233,108,171,110,131,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
