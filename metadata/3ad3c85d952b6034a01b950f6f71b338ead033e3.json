While the general concept is unchanged, the new edition features a broad array of new material, e.g., ultrafast lasers (atto- and femto-second lasers), coherent matter waves, Doppler-free Fourier spectroscopy, interference spectroscopy, quantum optics and gravitational waves and still more applications in chemical analysis, medical diagnostics, and engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ad3c85d952b6034a01b950f6f71b338ead033e3","amp;dn":"Laser+Spectroscopy+2+-+Experimental+Techniques+5th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ad3c85d952b6034a01b950f6f71b338ead033e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,211,200,93,149,43,96,52,160,27,149,15,111,113,179,56,234,208,51,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
