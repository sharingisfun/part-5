The present book treats these topics in detail. It also presents the nuclear reaction and structure theory, thermonuclear reaction rate formalism and stellar nucleosynthesis. The topics are discussed in a coherent way, enabling the reader to grasp their interconnections intuitively. The book serves both as a textbook, with many examples and end-of-chapter exercises, but also as a reference book for use by researchers working in the field of nuclear astrophysics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c3b2db55eeb907f7bc64cedb55b2db2e34e0fe","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Physics+of+Stars.djvu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c3b2db55eeb907f7bc64cedb55b2db2e34e0fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,195,178,219,85,238,185,7,247,188,100,206,219,85,178,219,46,52,224,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
