Combine Douglas AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irreverent take on life, the universe, and everything with a genuinely moving love story, and you have some idea of the humor, originality, and poignancy of Matt HaigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest novel.\n\nOur hero, Professor Andrew Martin, is dead before the book even begins. As it turns out, though, he wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a very nice man--as the alien imposter who now occupies his body discovers. Sent to Earth to destroy evidence that Andrew had solved a major mathematical problem, the alien soon finds himself learning more about the professor, his family, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“the humansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ than he ever expected. When he begins to fall for his own wife and son--who have no idea heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the real Andrew--the alien must choose between completing his mission and returning home or finding a new home right here on Earth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f79ce36f89ff5f1524c40c24153ad67ce8f140","amp;dn":"Matt+Haig+-+The+Humans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f79ce36f89ff5f1524c40c24153ad67ce8f140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,247,156,227,111,137,255,95,21,36,196,12,36,21,58,214,124,232,241,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
