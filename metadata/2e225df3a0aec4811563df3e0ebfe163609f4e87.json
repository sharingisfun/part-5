Number Ones includes his solo chart toppers in the UK and abroad from the period beginning with his Off the Wall album right up to the new song &quot;One More Chance&quot;, a collaboration with R Kelly. The remaining 17 songs on the album are all classics drawn from the disco-soul Off the Wall, the funky Thriller, the good Bad, the safe Dangerous, the semi-best-of History and the weak Invincible. Regardless of whether the bulk of Number Ones has appeared on other greatest hits albums, this is still an incredible selection of Michael Jackson's best music. --Georgina Collins\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Don't stop 'til you get enough                       [03:56]\n02.Rock with you                                        [03:41]\n03.Billie jean                                          [04:54]\n04.Beat it                                              [04:18]\n05.Thriller                                             [05:12]\n06.I just can't stop loving you                         [04:12]\n07.Bad                                                  [04:07]\n08.Smooth criminal                                      [04:17]\n09.The way you make me feel                             [04:58]\n10.Man in the mirror                                    [05:04]\n11.Dirty diana                                          [04:41]\n12.Black or white                                       [03:19]\n13.You are not alone                                    [04:34]\n14.Earth song                                           [05:01]\n15.You rock my world                                    [04:27]\n16.Break of dawn                                        [05:30]\n17.One more chance                                      [03:49]\n18.Ben (live)                                           [02:59]\n________\n78:59 min\n122,8 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
