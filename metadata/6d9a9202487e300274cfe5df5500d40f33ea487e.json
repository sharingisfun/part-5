Some pages have intentional spelling errors, &quot;fake&quot; defects, dots and signs that may be lost at OCR\n2. There are a lot of pages where text is upside down, written verticaly or diagonally and this is part of the book\n\nIf you wish to try your luck at OCRing the book, you should be able to export each page to BMP and try.\n\n\nI have spent several days at scanning this book so a thanks will go a long way in motivating me to upload future books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d9a9202487e300274cfe5df5500d40f33ea487e","amp;dn":"House+Of+Leaves+In+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d9a9202487e300274cfe5df5500d40f33ea487e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,154,146,2,72,126,48,2,116,207,229,223,85,0,212,15,51,234,72,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
