Through unparalleled musicianship and a timelessauthentic sound. Made Up Mind proves that TTB is fast becoming a band for the ages. TTB is known for their extraordinary family of musicians and Made Up Mind continues that tradition as most tracks were penned by husband and wife. Tedeschi and Trucks along with various friends and co-writers Doyle Bramhall Eric KrasnoGary Lour's John Leventhal all of whom also contributed to TTB's debut Revelator. The album was also co-produced by Jim Scott (Johnny Cash Red Hot Chili PeppersWilco) and Trucks and engineered by Bobby Tis - the same team that developed the last two TTB albums. Made Up Mind features &quot;Part of Me,&quot; a song driven by a classic southern soul groove straight out of Muscle Shoals. The raucous soul-rocker title track &quot;Made Up Mind&quot; demonstrates the full power of the band from the album's first notes. Throughout the course of the album it becomes increasingly apparent that Susan Tedeschi has evolved into one of the most dauntingly commanding vocalists in contemporary musicher serious lung power exploding on standout tracks such as the ÃƒÂ¼ber funky &quot;Misunderstood&quot; and just as convincingly digging into the core of poignant tender ballads like &quot;It's So Heavy&quot; and &quot;Calling Out to You.&quot; Derek Trucks has indisputably matured as a guitarist of our time tearing up barnburners with his slide and lead lines while showcasing his easier more subtle touch on the bluesy &quot;Do I Look Worried . Although Tedeschi Trucks Band bears the names of its co-leaders each member of this 11-piece juggernaut contributes equally there are no weak links in this true group achievement.\nTedeschi Trucks Band - Made Up Mind (flac) [MentalZero][Eccles] (Size: 322.38 MB)\n \t\t00 Tedeschi Trucks Band album art 01.JPG\t31.65 KB\n \t\t00 Tedeschi Trucks Band album art 02.JPG\t66.94 KB\n \t\t01 Made Up Mind.flac\t24.99 MB\n \t\t02 Do I Look Worried.flac\t29.73 MB\n \t\t03 Idle Wind.flac\t31.6 MB\n \t\t04 Misunderstood.flac\t37.45 MB\n \t\t05 Part Of Me.flac\t26.02 MB\n \t\t06 Whiskey Legs.flac\t26.19 MB\n \t\t07 It's So Heavy.flac\t27.93 MB\n \t\t08 All That I Need.flac\t32.33 MB\n \t\t09 Sweet And Low.flac\t25.85 MB\n \t\t10 The Storm.flac\t43 MB\n \t\t11 Calling Out To You.flac\t17.19 MB\n \t\tMade Up Mind.cue\t1.87 KB\n \t\tTedesci Trucks Band - Made Up Mind.m3u\t1.62 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t2.59 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t749 bytes\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 322 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Made Up Mind\t\t\t\nTrack name/Total                         : 11\nComposer                                 : Tedeschi Trucks Band\nGenre                                    : Blues Rock\nRecorded date                            : Ausgust 19, 2013\n\n\n\n===========================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 888 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44 KHz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:547d81abbd04eceb17cf5206398a4721b162f382","amp;dn":"Tedeschi+Trucks+Band+-+Made+Up+Mind+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D%5BEccles%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"547d81abbd04eceb17cf5206398a4721b162f382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,125,129,171,189,4,236,235,23,207,82,6,57,138,71,33,177,98,243,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
