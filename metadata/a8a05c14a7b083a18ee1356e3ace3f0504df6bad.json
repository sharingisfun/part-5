They were once noisy, risky, and ineffective, but today's new machines are safe and sleek, and make cooking fabulous meals in no time a snap. In The Ultimate Pressure Cooker Cookbook, Tom Lacalamita's expert advice will guide you through buying and caring for your pressure cooker, and his delicious foolproof recipes are your keys to success.\n\nBy cooking with high temperature and steam pressure, a pressure cooker seals in flavor and prepares in minutes what takes hours with conventional methods. Besides being an incredible time saver, a pressure cooker is capable of producing delicious, intensely flavored food that is also low in fat. Imagine being able to produce healthy nutritious home-cooked meals any night of the week. With The Ultimate Pressure Cooker Cookbook as your companion, it is all possible.\n\nJust pile the ingredients into a pot, lock the lid, and bring to full pressure, and in 20 minutes you can have rich homemade soup that tastes as if it had been simmering on the stove for hours. Perhaps you feel like a taste of Italy...how does perfect creamy risotto in 10 minutes sound? Delicious meals that taste as though you spent the day in the kitchen are at your fingertips when you use a pressure cooker.\n\nWith the same thoroughness used in his three previous books in the Ultimate Cookbook series, Lacalamita begins by methodically examining all the types of pressure cookers available, giving careful instructions and expert advice on their use and maintenance. In over 85 triple-tested recipes derived from the Mediterranean tradition, he then shows how pressure cookers are great tools for today's cooks. Step-by-step instructions guide you through these tasty and healthy pressure-cooker recipes -- from rich Vegetable Soup with Basil or hearty Turkish Bean Stew to Mussels h la Cataplana and Loin of Pork with Bitter-Orange Sauce. In addition to nutritional analysis for each recipe, charts of basic cooking times and conversion formulas are provided so that favorite home recipes can also be adapted to cooking in the pressure cooker.\n\nIn The Ultimate Pressure Cooker Cookbook, Tom Lacalamita is your guide to the world of fast, fabulous cooking.\n\nNote from uploader: Front cover is the last page","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a05c14a7b083a18ee1356e3ace3f0504df6bad","amp;dn":"Tom+Lacalamita+-+The+Ultimate+Pressure+Cooker+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a05c14a7b083a18ee1356e3ace3f0504df6bad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,160,92,20,167,176,131,161,142,225,53,110,58,206,63,5,4,223,107,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
