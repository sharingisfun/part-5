Second printing, with corrections.\n\nISBN: 9780691059082 | 352 pages | PDF\n\n\nTwenty-five years ago one could list by name the tiny number of multiple personalities recorded in the history of Western medicine, but today hundreds of people receive treatment for multiple personality disorder [MPD -- now called dissociative identity disorder] in every sizable town in North America. Clinicians, backed by a grassroots movement of patients and therapists, find child sexual abuse to be the primary cause of the illness, while critics accuse the MPD community of fostering false memories of childhood trauma. Here the distinguished philosopher Ian Hacking uses the MPD epidemic and its links with the contemporary concept of child abuse to scrutinize today's moral and political climate, especially our power struggles about memory and our efforts to cope with psychological injuries.\n\nWhat is it like to suffer from multiple personality? Most diagnosed patients are women: why does gender matter? How does defining an illness affect the behavior of those who suffer from it? And, more generally, how do systems of knowledge about kinds of people interact with the people who are known about? Answering these and similar questions, Hacking explores the development of the modern multiple personality movement. He then turns to a fascinating series of historical vignettes about an earlier wave of multiples, people who were diagnosed as new ways of thinking about memory emerged, particularly in France, toward the end of the nineteenth century. Fervently occupied with the study of hypnotism, hysteria, sleepwalking, and fugue, scientists of this period aimed to take the soul away from the religious sphere. What better way to do this than to make memory a surrogate for the soul and then subject it to empirical investigation?\n\nMade possible by these nineteenth-century developments, the current outbreak of dissociative disorders is embedded in new political settings. Rewriting the Soul concludes with a powerful analysis linking historical and contemporary material in a fresh contribution to the archaeology of knowledge. As Foucault once identified a politics that centers on the body and another that classifies and organizes the human population, Hacking has now provided a masterful description of the politics of memory: the scientizing of the soul and the wounds it can receive.\n\nFor more on the book, see the Wikipedia article: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting_the_Soul:_Multiple_Personality_and_the_Sciences_of_Memory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting_the_Soul:_Multiple_Personality_and_the_Sciences_of_Memory&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;In this brilliant and provocative new book, Ian Hacking fixes his searching gaze on the hot topic of multiple personality. The results are remarkable... In Hacking's hands, multiple personality emerges as a paradigmatic case study illuminating basic questions about truth, memory, fact and fiction, about knowledge, science, and identity... [This book] treats these impossibly difficult problems of knowability in the human sciences with grace and wisdom.&quot; -- Ellen Herman, Contemporary Psychology\n\n&quot;The details of Hacking's discussion are enthralling and illuminating. He manages to avoid altogether the sensationalism usually associated with treatments of multiple personality, providing an informative history and raising deep and important philosophical issues.&quot; -- Marya Schechtman, Mind\n\n&quot;There is little Mr. Hacking leaves untouched. His book ranges from history, science and philosophical rumination to amused reflections on daily life with equal authority and grace. Mr. Hacking writes with a poetic, almost elegiac beauty.&quot; -- Washington Times\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb01514fdddca5bfc54f2e21b71bfce7951b1d98","amp;dn":"Ian+Hacking+-+Rewriting+the+Soul+%5Bon+multiple+personality%5D+%281998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb01514fdddca5bfc54f2e21b71bfce7951b1d98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,1,81,79,221,220,165,191,197,79,46,33,183,27,252,231,149,27,29,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
