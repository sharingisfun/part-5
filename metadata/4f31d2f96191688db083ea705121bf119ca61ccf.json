Naturally they contain the songs every one knows and loves from an artist, but what usually gets me is that they in a lot of instances omit the other songs of that performer's catalog, that while not as popular, are every bit as good. In a lot of cases these songs are essential to grasping that artist. This collection of gems from the pride of Muscle Shoals, Alabama does a fine job capturing the essence of Mr. Bobby Womack. All of the hits are here, from &quot;Womans Gotta Have It&quot;, &quot;That's The Way I Feel About Cha&quot;, the classic &quot;If You Think Your Lonely Now&quot; (covered tremendously by K-Ci by the way) and what Womack greatest hits would be complete without &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;? My standout personal favorite is the soul stirring &quot;Harry Hippie&quot;.  Womacks' vocals are so on point on this and virtually every song on this collection. He is without a doubt one of soul music's most important voices, and this cd testifies to that effect. My only complaint is a few too many covers. The versions of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot;, &quot;California Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; are nothing special. They could have been replaced by other songs less known to someone prone to buy a greatest hits cd, thus drawing them deeper into the artist. Again that is why I usually avoid GH albums even when getting to know an artist for the first time. I'll start with the most popular album, then work my way through. Though it may take a little longer, it's usually more fulfilling to do it that way. Other than my lil hangup, this is a strong assemblage of Womack's music, and the price is usually perfect for those looking to dig up on some great soul music by him, possibly for the first time.\nAmazon Review By D.
