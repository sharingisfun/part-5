As the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“at workÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ suggest, Peter Seibel focuses on how his interviewees tackle the day-to-day work of programming, while revealing much more, like how they became great programmers, how they recognize programming talent in others, and what kinds of problems they find most interesting.\n\nHundreds of people have suggested names of programmers to interview on the Coders at Work web site: www.codersatwork.com. The complete list was 284 names. Having digested everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feedback, we selected 15 folks whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been kind enough to agree to be interviewed:\n\n    Frances Allen: Pioneer in optimizing compilers, first woman to win the Turing Award (2006) and first female IBM fellow\n    Joe Armstrong: Inventor of Erlang\n    Joshua Bloch: Author of the Java collections framework, now at Google\n    Bernie Cosell: One of the main software guys behind the original ARPANET IMPs and a master debugger\n    Douglas Crockford: JSON founder, JavaScript architect at Yahoo!\n    L.
