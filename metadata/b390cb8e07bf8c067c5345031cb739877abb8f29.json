In which case you'd need to use the torrent -recheck\nfacility in your software to verify anything thats missing for you to\nbegin to seed. ta!!\n\nSame goes for our re-launches of our best movie successes of the past,\nas in many cases we've only added a folder with an image of the DVD jacket, etc\nWe have however made them all multi-tracker enabled in our re-launch program.\n\n\n&quot;Yes Minister&quot; is the best of comedy that there is to be found - British!\nIt ranks with &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; in its popularity among many if not most\nand is bloody great entertainment for which there can be no acceptable\nsubstitute of resempling quality.\n\nThis entire collection of ALL Yes Minister episodes from the complete\nDVD collection is in efficient DivX format to save downloading time and bother.\nGreat picture and sound, and you could even downlod yourselves a software\nconverter (if needed) for your video ipod, perhaps! &quot;Yes Prime Minister&quot; was also\nre-launched as a complete collection and is adequately seeding, less than a\nfull day later! We thought we'd start with that series for those that only want \none series collection rather than both, from this related titles. Maigret will\nfollow soon.\n\nPick and choose from the episodes on the torrent file, or go for all\nat once, its all the same (you can simply activate one episode at a time\nwhile going for the whole nine yards). Thanks for seeding to everyone\nthats wanting to be intitiated or to enjoy this whenever they wish!! ta!!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nReviews: moviesbyrizzo.info\n\nOptional Note: This is a multi-tracker torrent\nIf you use utorrent software, simply highlight the mounted torrent, then\nclick on &quot;trackers&quot; in your software, next, right click on the tracker that\nis showing, and select &quot;add tracker&quot; You should then then see all the trackers\nthat are alreay included atthe outset. Place a space (blank line) between each\ntracker showing, then click &quot;ok&quot; Your trackers will now show status and update\nmore easily when required (if desired, right click manually, on a selected\ntracker or on DHT and select &quot;update&quot; for a better read).\n\nPS If you enable &quot;show alternating background color&quot; in your preferences\nmenu for &quot;UI settings&quot;, you'll find your screen easier on the eye and more\npleasing to read. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b390cb8e07bf8c067c5345031cb739877abb8f29","amp;dn":"Yes+Minister+Complete+series+%28lovely+DivX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b390cb8e07bf8c067c5345031cb739877abb8f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,144,203,142,7,191,140,6,124,83,69,3,28,183,57,135,122,187,143,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
