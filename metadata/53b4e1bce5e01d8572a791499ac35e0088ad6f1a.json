Translated by Brian McGuiness and David Pears, with an Introduction by Bertrand Russell.\n\nISBN: 9780415255622 | 144 pages | PDF\n\n\nPerhaps the most important work of philosophy written in the twentieth century, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus was the only philosophical work that Ludwig Wittgenstein published during his lifetime.  Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme brilliance, it captured the imagination of a generation of philosophers.\n\nFor Wittgenstein, logic was something we use to conquer a reality which is in itself both elusive and unobtainable. He famously summarized the book in the following words: &quot;What can be said at all can be said clearly; and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.&quot;\n\nDavid Pears and Brian McGuinness received the highest praise for their meticulous translation. The work is prefaced by Bertrand Russell's original introduction to the first English edition.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b4e1bce5e01d8572a791499ac35e0088ad6f1a","amp;dn":"Ludwig+Wittgenstein+-+Tractatus+Logico-Philosophicus%2C+2nd+edn.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b4e1bce5e01d8572a791499ac35e0088ad6f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,180,225,188,229,224,29,133,114,167,145,73,154,195,94,0,136,173,111,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
