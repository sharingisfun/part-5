Make no mistake, Snoop&amp;#039;s raps are still very much gangsta, as the title of the disc implies and as &quot;Bang Out&quot; clearly outlines. They&amp;#039;re just a bit more adult-contemporary gangsta now. Despite the heavy pro-pimp overtones, the Doggfather&amp;#039;s smoothed-out timbre and flow mask the harshness of his regressive views. The exceptional production throughout is highlighted by the Neptunes&amp;#039; contributions, from the catchy, minimalist &quot;Drop It Like It&amp;#039;s Hot&quot; all the way to the &amp;#039;80s retro-funk jam &quot;Let&amp;#039;s Get Blown.&quot; Steady vocal contributions from funk stalwart Charlie Wilson (Gap Band) and 50 Cent, and nasty beats supplied by everyone from the Alchemist to Hi-Tek put this one over the top. --Dalton Higgins  \n\n\n1.
