One button allows users to capture the entire screen, whereas the Capture Area button lets users select the part of the screen they want to include. \r\n\r\nThis allows users to save time by cropping their screen capture at the start, instead of fiddling with cropping after the fact. Users can enter a file name and location to save the image, if desired, or the program will simply copy the image to the clipboard if nothing is entered. \r\n\r\nThe program's only other feature is a button that opens Microsoft Paint, allowing users to immediately start editing their screenshot. ScreenCapture has no Help file, but we can't say this is a major fault; there's not much of anything that one could need help with. \r\n\r\nAt a mere 636KB, ScreenCapture is small enough to be carried on a USB drive or other portable device, which is a nice plus. Overall, ScreenCapture doesn't offer much in the way of features, but we like it for its simplicity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbf5e8d7edaa04588959bc7abe12c69c6899ddda","amp;dn":"Screen+Capture+MINI+600k+portable+%5BTuzito%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbf5e8d7edaa04588959bc7abe12c69c6899ddda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,245,232,215,237,170,4,88,137,89,188,122,190,18,198,156,104,153,221,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
