Miles &quot;Pudge&quot; Halter's whole existence has been one big nonevent, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave the &quot;Great Perhaps&quot; (FranÃ§ois Rabelais, poet) even more. Then he heads off to the sometimes crazy, possibly unstable, and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe.
