Ã¢â‚¬Å“We just wanted to make sure that no one would ever mistake us for a folk band ever again,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ jokes James Felice when discussing Celebration, Florida, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark, twisted synth-heavy 2011 record.\n\nFavorite Waitress, due June 17th, will be a more recognizable return to basics for long-time fans of the upstate New York group. The album was recorded in the winter of 2013 at Mike Mogis and Conor OberstÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Arc Studios in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nFavorite Waitress marks the first time the Felice Brothers have recorded in a proper studio outside of their native Hudson Valley, but James Felice says that more than any other record the band has released to date, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut with record label Dualtone resembles the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live sound.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We realized that we could have these interesting sonic motifs and have weird sounding songs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Felice of their last record, Ã¢â‚¬Å“but on Favorite Waitress we really wanted to make sure that we could perform them live. More than anything weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever done, our new record has been the product of the Felice Brothers as a live touring band.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTrue to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free-flowing live show, Favorite Waitress features plenty of shared sing-alongs and feel-good harmony, with band members James Felice and Christmas Clapton contributing several songs in addition to primary songwriter Ian Felice. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more collaboration on this album than anything weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever done,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says James Felice. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been doing this for a long time, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sort of weird to think about, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pros now.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b3f0fffad00e1dbeb145244420cff5dd62060d","amp;dn":"The+Felice+Brothers+-+Favorite+Waitress+%5B2014%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b3f0fffad00e1dbeb145244420cff5dd62060d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,179,240,255,250,208,14,29,190,177,69,36,68,32,207,245,221,98,6,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
