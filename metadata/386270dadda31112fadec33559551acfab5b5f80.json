Stella (also available on other platforms) is the all around best one for compatability and speed (for faster machines). Pcatari works smoother on slower machines. \n\nThis is the download for you if all you want to do is play Atari 2600 on your computer without having to download a bunch of extra useless stuff. \nAll you need is right here in one small download!\n\nAlso, I don't have a whole smorgasborg of confusing files to mulch through. I divided the files into 3 seperate folders for easy identification: 1.Roms 2.Manuals 3.Emulators Easy as 1-2-3! First intall an emulator (Stella is recommended) then load the rom directory into the emulator and you're off! \n\nTo get stella for other operating systems go to &lt;a href=&quot; http://stella.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://stella.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you enjoy this download please feel free to leave a positive comment and a good rating. Thanks and have fun!\n\nIMPORTANT!!! Most of these games start with the F2 function key. However, some start with the spacebar or by pressing -enter- then F2. Also, A detailed user guide complete with illustrations can be found in the resulting Stella docs folder. It even has a brief history of the 2600 VCS!\n\nCheck out my other torrents!
