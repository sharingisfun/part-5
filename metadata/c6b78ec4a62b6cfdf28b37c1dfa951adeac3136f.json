Resize your images using BenVista PhotoZoom Pro 4, and get superb results through our unique, award-winning S-Spline technology!\n \nHigher Quality: Equipped with S-Spline Max, the latest generation of BenVista's patented S-Spline algorithm, PhotoZoom Pro 4 creates image enlargements of unequalled quality. PhotoZoom Pro 4 beats any of the alternative solutions, such as Photoshop's Bicubic technique, fractal-based methods, and so-called 'industry standards'.\n \nTruly Any Size: Where competitors fail to get past 300000 by 300000 pixels (or even much lower), PhotoZoom Pro 4 enlarges images up to 1 million by 1 million pixels. No other product offers this capability, let alone with preservation of image quality.\n \nFits into your Workflow: BenVista does not intend to dictate how you should fit PhotoZoom Pro 4 into your workflow.

You can choose which you like best. You can even fine-tune each technique to your personal liking, and save your favorite settings so you can use them again later.\n \nNew in PhotoZoom Pro 4 are the additional fine-tuning options for S-Spline Max, offering improved sharpness control and a great new technology for reducing JPEG compression artifacts and noise.\n \nImage Support: PhotoZoom Pro 4 perfectly meets the requirements of the professional user when it comes to image support. It fully supports color spaces like RGB, CMYK, Grayscale and Lab, just like metadata of the types EXIF, IPTC, XMP, and ICC profiles. Also, PhotoZoom Pro 4 supports layers, 16 bits/channel (including Raw) and 32 bits/channel (HDR) images and, last but not least, a very wide range of image file formats.\n \nConclusion: PhotoZoom Pro 4 is the ideal solution for enlarging digital images, both for printing and on-screen purposes. Besides enlargements of unequalled quality it offers various professional functions and features, and can be easily fit into anyone's workflow. PhotoZoom Pro 4 is an absolute must-have for both professionals and serious amateurs who want to resize their images.\n \nPhotoZoom Pro 4 - System requirements\n \nWindows:\n Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2008, 2003, or 2000 (32 &amp; 64bit)\n Photoshop version CS2 or higher for plug-ins\n \nHomepage: http://www.benvista.com/\n \nInstallation Instructions:\n \n1.
