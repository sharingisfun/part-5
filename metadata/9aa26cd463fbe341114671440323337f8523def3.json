Steven Waddington stars as the tragic King Edward, Andrew Teirnan as his beloved Gaveston, Nigel Terry as the villainous Mortimer and Tilda Swinton is the jealous and destructive Queen Isabella. One of the film's most surprising sequences occurs when Annie Lennox appears crooning Cole Porter's classic &quot;Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,&quot; the piece she performed in the AIDS benefit &quot;Red, Hot and Blue.&quot;\n\n\n\n \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tSteven Waddington as Edward II\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tKevin Collins as Lightbourne, the Jailor\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tAndrew Tiernan as Piers Gaveston\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tJohn Lynch as Spencer\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tDudley Sutton as Bishop of Winchester\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tTilda Swinton as Isabella\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tJerome Flynn as Kent\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tJody Graber as Prince Edward\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tNigel Terry as Mortimer\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tJill Balcon as Chorus of Nobility\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tBarbara New as Chorus of Nobility\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tAndrea Miller as Chorus of Nobility\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tBrian Mitchell as Chorus of Nobility\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tDavid Glover as Chorus of Nobility\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tJohn Quentin as Chorus of Nobility\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tAndrew Charleson as Chorus of Nobility\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tRoger Hammond as Bishop\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tAllan Corduner as Poet\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tAnnie Lennox as Singer\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Âª\tTony Forsyth as Captive Policeman\n\n\nIn Edward II, the new king of England (title role played by Steven Waddington, of The Last of the Mohicans, Carrington), finds his throne in peril when he brings his lover Gaveston (Andrew Tiernan, The Pianist) back from exile.
