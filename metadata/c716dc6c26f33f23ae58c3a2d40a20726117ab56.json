It was released on 22 June 1979.\n\nIt was recorded live during the European leg of Queen's Jazz world tour between January and March 1979.[5] The album was self-produced by the band and was their first album to be mixed at their own studios, Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland.\n\nGuitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor revealed on the US radio show In the Studio with Redbeard (which spotlighted the making of 1980's The Game) that the band was not happy with the album's final mix as the band mixed the album themselves.\n\nDespite May and Taylor's unhappiness with the album, Live Killers reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 16 on the Billboard 200 in the United States, and is certified double platinum in the US.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n    &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; [fast version] (Brian May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18\n    &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; (Freddie Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n    &quot;Death on Two Legs (Dedicated To...)&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:31\n    &quot;Killer Queen&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:59\n    &quot;Bicycle Race&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:28\n    &quot;I'm in Love with My Car&quot; (Roger Taylor) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:08\n    &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:31\n    &quot;You're My Best Friend&quot; (John Deacon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:08\n    &quot;Now I'm Here&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:42\n    &quot;Dreamer's Ball&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44\n    &quot;Love of My Life&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:57\n    &quot;'39&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:26\n    &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:02\n\nDisc 2\n\n    &quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:28\n    &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot; (Deacon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:17\n    &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 12:13\n    &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; [intro: &quot;Mustapha&quot;] (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:02\n    &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:40\n    &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; (Taylor) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:35\n    &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (May) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n    &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; (Mercury) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:27\n    &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (Trad.; arr.
