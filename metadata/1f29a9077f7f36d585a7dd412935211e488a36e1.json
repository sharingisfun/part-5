He's got a pretty typical life for a six-year-old troll. He lives\nin the enchanted Orange Forest with his beloved dragon Norville, surrounded by\nfantastical friends like Gina Giant, Ogre Doug, Libby Light Sprite, and the\ntroublemaking Bobgoblin. But Wally has something that sets him apart from\neveryone else: a magic stick that can make any word come to life!\n\nProduced by Nickelodeon Productions.\n\n\nWhen Wally's glider lands in Stan's swamp, the grumpy swamp monster\nissues a challenge: he'll give the glider back if Wally can make him\nlaugh. It's no easy task, because Stan has never laughed before.\n\nWallykazam.S01E07.Totally.Swamped.720p.WEBRip.x264.AAC.mp4\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 29.970fps [CRF 23.0 - PS3 Preset]\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo  [128Kbps ABR]\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:23:03\nFile size: 188 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f29a9077f7f36d585a7dd412935211e488a36e1","amp;dn":"Wallykazam.S01E07.Totally.Swamped.720p.WEBRip.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f29a9077f7f36d585a7dd412935211e488a36e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,41,169,7,127,127,54,213,133,167,221,65,41,53,33,30,72,138,54,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
