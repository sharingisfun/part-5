They never returned, their bodies were never recovered, and only painful questions remain. \n\nNow, in the aftermath of a rush-hour hit-and-run accident, a clearly disoriented woman is claiming to be Heather, the younger Bethany sister. Not a shred of evidence supports her story, and every lead she reluctantly offers takes the police to another dead endÃ¢â‚¬â€a dying, incoherent man; a razed house; a missing grave. \n\nBut she definitely knows something about that terrible dayÃ¢â‚¬â€and about the shocking fissures that the tragedy exposed in the foundation of a seemingly solid family.\n\nGenre: Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf93bc0df8aeff493ac6b39eea2bacd6546718a2","amp;dn":"What+The+Dead+Know+by+Laura+Lippman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf93bc0df8aeff493ac6b39eea2bacd6546718a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,147,188,13,248,174,255,73,58,198,179,158,234,43,172,214,84,103,24,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
