It includes some substantial and incredibly useful titles. The original uploads are not mine; but I have sourced them and collected them together for convenience. I offer particular thanks to whoever _F1_ might be on The Pirate Bay. His offerings were remarkably wide-ranging and consistently excellent.\n\nUsers of this selection will, I am sure, soon discover that PDF versions are ideal for casual reference (in the way that you might access a tome in a University Library) but are not - other than for those few who really can comfortably read text off an illuminated screen for long periods - really substitutes for the hard copy when intensive study is required. Unfortunately, in my experience, such reference works as are offered here are far too often unavailable to students and other readers in their local libraries, either because the books are not on the shelves at all - having been lost, damaged, stolen or loaned out - or because there are just too few copies available to meet the demand that should have been anticipated.\n\nThe titles included are:\n\nCambridge Companions to:\nThe Age of Pericles\nAncient Greek Law\nAncient Greek Political Thought\nThe Age of Augustus\nThe Age of Constantine\nThe Roman Republic\nThe Babylonian World\nThe Cambridge Ancient History\nThe Cambridge History of Africa\nThe Cambridge History of Russia\nThe Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia\nThe New Cambridge Modern History\nThe Second World War - Winston Churchill\nThe New Cambridge Medieval History\nThe Civil War - Shelby Foote\nHistorical Atlas of Ancient Rome\nMiddle Ages Reference Library - Judson Knight\nThe Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare\nBlackwell's Companion to International History 1900-2001\nPlagues in World History\nThe Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire\nThe Oxford History of Modern Europe\nThe Oxford History of the Classical World\n\nHappy browsing......and seed on!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb20efb5f56215e1e6a0e5a3e207dec5eb8464d","amp;dn":"The+History+Reference+Collection+++%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb20efb5f56215e1e6a0e5a3e207dec5eb8464d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,178,14,251,95,86,33,94,30,106,14,90,62,32,125,236,94,184,70,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
