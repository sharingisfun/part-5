But his cousin, Shan yos'Galen can't wait. With enemy agents closing in, he invokes Plan B-setting in motion a series of events that will have dire consequences-for all of Liad.\n\nPursued across space by the ultra-secret Department of the Interior, hunted by the galaxy-wide Juntavas syndicate, former Agent of Change Val Con yos'Phelium and his ex-soldier lifemate Miri Robertson have commandeered the only spaceship on Vandar and fled, seeking help from Miri's newly discovered kin on Lytaxin. Elsewhere, Clan Korval is in action. Scattered across space by the newly invoked Plan B, certain clan members pursue the search for the long-missing Val Con.\n\nFirst Speaker Nova yos'Galan returns to Lufkit, seeking clues, as Dutiful Passage, Korval's premier tradeship, arms itself for war - and discovers treachery. Back on Lytaxin, Miri's homecoming is interrupted by a full-scale Yxtrang planetary invasion. Then things start to get really interesting....\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Andy Caploe\nLength: 14 hrs and 2 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:09-04-12\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e3aa1f65828b0041c88333263b4d7aa900641ad","amp;dn":"Sharon+Lee%2C+Steve+Miller+-+Plan+B+%28Liaden+Universe+%2311%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e3aa1f65828b0041c88333263b4d7aa900641ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,58,161,246,88,40,176,4,28,136,51,50,99,180,215,170,144,6,65,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
