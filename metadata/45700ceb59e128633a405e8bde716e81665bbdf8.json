It made the shortlist for the 2006 Mercury Music Prize and was one of NME's top one hundred albums of the decade.\n\nThe Mercury nomination provoked some criticism, as collaborator Mark Lanegan is American and the award is for British and Irish artists only. However Campbell wrote most of the tracks and self-produced the album. Campbell had written the music and some of the lyrics, before sending it to Lanegan.\n\nReleased 2006 \nRecorded 2005 \nGenre Indie pop\nAlternative rock \nLength 42:45 \nLabel V2 Records \nProducer Isobel Campbell, Dave Paterson \n\nsongs written by Isobel Campbell except where stated\n\n&quot;Deus Ibi Est&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51 \n&quot;Black Mountain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10 (music based in part on the traditional melody &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;) \n&quot;The False Husband&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53 \n&quot;Ballad of the Broken Seas&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42 \n&quot;Revolver&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40 (Mark Lanegan) \n&quot;Ramblin' Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29 (Hank Williams) \n&quot;(Do You Wanna) Come Walk with Me?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 \n&quot;Saturday's Gone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37 \n&quot;It's Hard to Kill a Bad Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53 (Jim McCulloch) \n&quot;Honey Child What Can I Do?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 (Campbell/Shaw) \n&quot;Dusty Wreath&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 \n&quot;The Circus Is Leaving Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35 \n\nPersonnel\nMark Lanegan - Vocals \nIsobel Campbell - Vocals, Piano, Cello, Harpsichord, Tubular Bells, Glockenspiel \nAlyn Cosker - Drums \nJim McCulloch - Guitars \nRoss Hamilton - Double Bass (1,6-8), Bass Guitar (4,10,12) \nDavid Robertson - Bodhran (1), Percussion (8), Congas (9) \nBill Wells - Bass Guitar (2,3), Piano (4), Vibraphone (8) \nJohn McCusker - Solo Violin (4) \nJoshua Blanchard - Acoustic Guitar (5) \nEddi Nappi - Bass Guitar (5) \nNorm Block - Drums (5) \nGeoff Allen - Whip (6) \nClaire Campbell - Violin (8) \nHelen Thompson - Harp (10) \nChris Geddes - Hammond Organ (12) \nPaul Leonard Morgan - String Arrangements (3-5,9-10) \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45700ceb59e128633a405e8bde716e81665bbdf8","amp;dn":"Isobel+Campbell+%26+Mark+Lanegan...Ballad+of+the+Broken+Seas%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45700ceb59e128633a405e8bde716e81665bbdf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,112,12,235,89,225,40,99,58,64,94,139,222,113,110,129,102,91,189,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
