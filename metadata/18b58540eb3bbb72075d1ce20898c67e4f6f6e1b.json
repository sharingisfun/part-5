Like all Deitel Developer titles, they teach the best way possible: via hundreds of complete example C++ programs, with thousands of lines of downloadable C++ source code.\n\n\n\nUnlike other C++11 books, this guide teaches robust, best-practice coding practices that fully support the CERTÃ‚Â® Coordination CenterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authoritative secure coding standards. To help you write programs that are even more secure, the Deitels also introduce C++11Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s new non-deterministic random-number generation capabilities. Using all these techniques, you can write industrial-strength C+11 code that stands up to attacks from viruses, worms, and other forms of malware.\n\n\n\nIdeal for anyone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked with at least one programming language before, C++11 for Programmers utilizes a proven Ã¢â‚¬Å“early objectsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ approach, emphasizing program clarity, software reuse, and component-oriented software construction. In addition to the core language, it will help you take advantage of the newest standard libraries and the newest language extensions. Coverage includes many new C++11 features, including smart pointers, regular expressions, shared_ptr and weak_ptr, and more.\n\n\n\nThis book contains 240 complete C++11 programs (more than 15,000 lines of downloadable code). All code has been thoroughly tested on three popular industrial-strength C++11 compilers: GNU C++ 4.7, MicrosoftÃ‚Â® Visual C++Ã‚Â® 2012, and AppleÃ‚Â® LLVM in XcodeÃ‚Â® 4.5.\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18b58540eb3bbb72075d1ce20898c67e4f6f6e1b","amp;dn":"C%2B%2B11+for+Programmers+%2C+2E+%5BEpub%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18b58540eb3bbb72075d1ce20898c67e4f6f6e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,181,133,64,235,59,187,114,7,93,28,226,8,152,198,126,79,111,110,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
