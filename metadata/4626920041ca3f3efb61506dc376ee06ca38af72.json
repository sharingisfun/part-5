Gypsies have long been known as gifted musicians and their music has enlivened weddings, dances and other celebrations for centuries. Gypsy Caravan includes gorgeous songs that will astonish the listener with their emotional depth, entrancing rhythms and alluring melodies. \nOver the years, Gypsies have been simultaneously scorned and glorified, rejected and romanticized. They are almost mythical and magical beings, representing people outside the confines and mundane realities of the everyday world. Gypsy music is exotic, mysterious and accessible and will appeal to a broad range of people who are interested in world and folk music. The success of films and soundtracks on Gypsy music such as Latcho Drom reveals that there is broad interest in Gypsy music and culture. Gypsy Caravan also features detailed liner notes by noted music critic and Gypsy music specialist Michal Shapiro. \n\n\nTracklist:\nRomanyi Rota - Divi Divi, So Kerdjan \nKalyi Jag - Movi Shei, Sabina \nSaban Bajramovic - Pena \nVlatko Stefovski - Gipsy Song \nCoco Briaval - Les Yeux Noirs \nThierry Robin - L&amp;#039;Amour S&amp;#039;Envole \nMiguel Angel Cortes - Al Likindoy \nRomanyi Rota - Korkore Zav Ande Kalyi Ratyi \nAmaro Suno - Kutka Avel e Sej Bari \nDjelem - Codru \nAndo Drom - Sza Tele Zsav\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n\nFor more info: http://www.putumayo.com/ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4626920041ca3f3efb61506dc376ee06ca38af72","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Gypsy+Caravan+By+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4626920041ca3f3efb61506dc376ee06ca38af72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,38,146,0,65,202,63,62,251,97,80,109,195,118,238,6,202,56,175,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
