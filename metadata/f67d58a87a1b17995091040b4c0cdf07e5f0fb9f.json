rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Armed_Boxer&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBefore Bruce Lee, there were a few kung fu movie stars. The first huge star was Jimmy Wang Yu who started working in the very first Shaw Brothers sword plays back in 1965. He directed and starred in 'One-Armed Boxer' for Golden Harvest in 1971 and is in top form both in front of and behind the camera. While you can clearly see Jimmy Wang Yu is not a real martial artist, he is still one of the best kung fu stars ever. At least 50 people die in this movie and he does the most damage.\n\nThe story is simple. A gang that is involved in opium smuggling and prostitution is looking to take out Wang Yu's kung fu school. When defeated, the gang hires Japanese fighters. Well, mostly Japanese.\n 2 Thai kickboxers, 2 Tibetan Lamas, a Yoga kung fu master(I never heard of Yoga kung fu, but hey, it's a movie), a Judo expert, a Taekwondo expert, and the unstoppable Lung Fei. Lung Fei also brings his 2 students, and obviously Wang Yu doesn't stand a chance against all of these guys.\n These are truly 10 of the craziest villains that you will ever come across. Wong Wing San played the Yoga guy with extendable arms in 'Master of the Flying Guillotine', but he just plays one of Lung Fei's 2 students in this.\n I will stop my review right now and let you find out for yourself how Wang Yu loses his arm and gets revenge.\n\nIf you are a fan of kung fu movies pre-Bruce Lee, this is a must have. Maybe the best basher ever. It's one of the movies that started the imaginary world where only martial arts schools exist.\n So the one martial arts school is a gang, and the other school is made up of good people. You just have to go with it, but it more than works. The movie is serious, but takes place in a complete fantasy world. &quot;Never insult Tibetan martial arts&quot;.\n\nThere are too many good things to speak of when it comes to this movie. The great soundtrack, TONS of bloody fights (there is like 20 individual fights), Lung Fei's fangs, very creative training sequences, and best of all, Jimmy Wang Yu's acting.\n He was always the best at making me believe that he is in a really tough fight.\n\nOverall, this is a one of a kind. They didn't make enough crazy movies like this that actually had good stories. A true classic in every way.\n\nRed Sun version is widescreened with English and Cantonese languages. I don't know who they stole the print from.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/uOVTK7O&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/uOVTK7O&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjacker, from The Chop Shop.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
