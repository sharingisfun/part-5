The highly accessible text presents the scientific principles used in the construction of TCP/IP, and shows how the components were designed to work together. It covers details of each protocol, including ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, RIP, DHCP, OSPF and others. It also covers technologies such as Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Network Address Translation (NAT).
