Fortunately, Ezekiel Boone has upped the ante on arachnophobia. This is a fresh take on classic horror, thoroughly enjoyable and guaranteed to leave your skin crawling.â€ â€”Michael Koryta, New York Times bestselling author of Those Who Wish Me Dead\r\n\r\nAn astonishingly inventive and terrifying debut novel about the emergence of an ancient species, dormant for over a thousand years, and now on the march.\r\n\r\nDeep in the jungle of Peru, where so much remains unknown, a black, skittering mass devours an American tourist whole. Thousands of miles away, an FBI agent investigates a fatal plane crash in Minneapolis and makes a gruesome discovery. Unusual seismic patterns register in a Kanpur, India earthquake lab, confounding the scientists there. During the same week, the Chinese government â€œaccidentallyâ€ drops a nuclear bomb in an isolated region of its own country. As these incidents begin to sweep the globe, a mysterious package from South America arrives at a Washington, D.C. laboratory. Something wants out.\r\n\r\nThe world is on the brink of an apocalyptic disaster. An ancient species, long dormant, is now very much awake","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08fc3bb1097c7ddac10c1d26b105e1f1be43feb6","amp;dn":"The+Hatching+by+Ezekiel+Boone+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08fc3bb1097c7ddac10c1d26b105e1f1be43feb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,252,59,177,9,124,125,218,193,12,29,38,177,5,225,241,190,67,254,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
