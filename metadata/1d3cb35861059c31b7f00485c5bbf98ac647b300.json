Simple Port Forwarding works with WebPages and not directly with your router. Making it a safe program to use. Its no different than using Firefox, IE or any other browser to setup port forwarding yourself. The program works by automating the process for you. So whether you don't understand how to forward ports, or your simply looking for an easier way to forward ports then this program is for you. Its port forwarding made simple.\n\nSimple Port Forwarding has a large database of known ports for over 700+ games and programs, so finding the port you need is made a little easier. Simple Port Forwarding will also remember custom applications you put in, so you don't have to reenter them. The program remembers the last IP address you use to forward to, this helps not having to set it every time you load new ports!\n\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
