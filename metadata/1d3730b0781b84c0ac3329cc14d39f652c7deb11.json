The group consists of Bono (vocals and guitar), The Edge (guitar, keyboards and vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums and percussion). The band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed to Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, they had become a top international act. They were more successful as a live act than they were at selling records, until their 1987 album The Joshua Tree,[1] which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature &quot;from heroes to superstars&quot;.[2]\n\nTheir 1991 album Achtung Baby and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour were a musical and thematic reinvention for the band. Reacting to their own sense of musical stagnation and a late-1980s critical backlash, U2 incorporated dance music and alternative rock influences into their sound and performances, abandoning their earnest image for a more ironic, self-deprecating tone. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s. Since 2000, U2 have pursued a more conventional sound, while maintaining influences from their earlier musical explorations.\n\nU2 have released 12 studio albums and are among the most critically and commercially successful groups in popular music. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and they have sold more than 150 million records. In 2005, the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone magazine ranked U2 at number 22 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.[3] Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes, including Amnesty International, the ONE/DATA campaigns, Product Red, and The Edge's Music Rising. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoy 1980\n\n\nBoy is the debut album from Irish rock band U2, released October 20, 1980. Produced by Steve Lillywhite, the album received generally positive reviews. Common themes among the album's songs are the thoughts and frustrations of adolescence.[1] The album included the band's first United Kingdom hit single, &quot;I Will Follow&quot;. Boy's release was followed by U2's first tour of continental Europe and the United States.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;I Will Follow&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Twilight&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;An Cat Dubh&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Into the Heart&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Out of Control&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Stories for Boys&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;The Ocean&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;A Day Without Me&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;The Electric Co.&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Shadows and Tall Trees&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1981\n\n\nOctober is the second album by Irish rock band U2, released in 1981. The album featured spiritual themes, inspired by Bono, The Edge, and Larry Mullen, Jr.'s memberships in a Christian group called the &quot;Shalom Fellowship&quot;, which led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the rock and roll lifestyle.[1] The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n&quot;Gloria&quot;  \n&quot;I Fall Down&quot;  \n&quot;I Threw a Brick Through a Window&quot;  \n&quot;Rejoice&quot;  \n&quot;Fire&quot;  \n&quot;Tomorrow&quot;  \n&quot;October&quot;  \n&quot;With a Shout (Jerusalem)&quot;  \n&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;  \n&quot;Scarlet&quot;  \n&quot;Is That All?&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWar 1983\n\n\nWar is the third studio album by Irish rock band U2, released on 28 February 1983. The album has come to be regarded as U2's first overtly political album, in part because of songs like &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, &quot;New Year's Day&quot;, as well as the title, which stems from the band's perception of the world at the time; Bono stated that &quot;war seemed to be the motif for 1982.&quot;[8]\n\nWhile the central themes of their earlier albums Boy and October focused on adolescence and spirituality, respectively,[9] War focused on both the physical aspects of warfare, and the emotional aftereffects.[8] The album has been described as the record where the band &quot;turned pacifism itself into a crusade.&quot;[10]\n\nWar was a commercial success for the band, knocking Michael Jackson's Thriller from the top of the charts to become the band's first #1 album in the UK. It reached #12 in the U.S. and became their first Gold selling album there. In 2003, the album was ranked number 221 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Seconds&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;New Year's Day&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Like a Song...&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Drowning Man&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;The Refugee&quot; (produced by Bill Whelan)\n7.\t&quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Red Light&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Surrender&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;&quot;40&quot;&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder a Blood Red Sky 1983 \n\n\nUnder a Blood Red Sky is a mini-LP live album by Irish rock band U2, produced by Jimmy Iovine and released in 1983. Along with its companion concert film, U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky, the release helped establish U2's reputation as a live band, making the band a popular live college rock act.\n\nThe album consists of live recordings from three shows on the band's War Tour from Colorado, Boston, and Germany. Album highlights include a fiery rendition of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (famously introduced by Bono with the words, &quot;this is not a rebel song&quot;) and a jaunty run-through of the B-side &quot;Party Girl&quot;.\n\nAn accompanying concert video entitled Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky was released the following year. Unlike the album, the film was recorded entirely at the dramatic outdoor Red Rocks Amphitheatre on 5 June 1983. The band's performance of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; from the film has been cited as one of Rolling Stone's &quot;50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll.&quot;\n\nThe title is taken from the lyrics of the song &quot;New Year's Day&quot;, originally released on U2's War album.\n\nThe album was re-released as a remastered CD on September 29, 2008\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Gloria&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;11 O'Clock Tick Tock&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;I Will Follow&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Party Girl&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;The Electric Co.&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;New Year's Day&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;40&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unforgettable Fire 1984\n\n\nThe Unforgettable Fire is the fourth studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was released in October 1984. The band wanted a different musical direction following the harder-hitting rock of their 1983 album War. They employed Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois to produce and assist them experiment with a more ambient and abstract sound. The resulting change in direction was at the time the band's most dramatic.\n\nRecording began in May 1984 at Slane Castle, where the band lived, wrote, and recorded to find new inspiration. The album was completed in August 1984 at Windmill Lane Studios. It features atmospheric sounds and lyrics that lead vocalist Bono describes as &quot;sketches&quot;. Two songs feature lyrical tributes to Martin Luther King Jr. The Unforgettable Fire received generally favourable reviews from critics and produced the band's biggest hit at the time, &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;, as well as the live favorite &quot;Bad&quot;, a song about heroin addiction. A 25th Anniversary edition of the album was released in October 2009.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Wire&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Promenade&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;4th of July&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Bad&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Indian Summer Sky&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Elvis Presley and America&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;MLK&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Joshua Tree 1987\n\n\nThe Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by rock band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 9 March 1987 on Island Records. In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 release The Unforgettable Fire, for The Joshua Tree, U2 aimed for a harder-hitting sound that used the limitation of strict song structures. The album incorporates influences from American and Irish roots music into the band's sound, and thematically, it depicts their love-hate relationship with the United States.\n\nInspired by tour experiences in the United States and American literature they were reading, U2 settled on &quot;America&quot; as a theme for the record. Recording began in January 1986 in Ireland, and to foster a relaxed, creative atmosphere, the group recorded in two houses, in addition to two professional studios. Several events during the sessions helped shape the politically- and socially-conscious tone of the album, including the band's participation in A Conspiracy of Hope tour, the death of roadie Greg Carroll, and lead vocalist Bono's travels to Central America. Recording completed in November, with additional production continuing into January 1987. Throughout the sessions, U2 sought a &quot;cinematic&quot; quality for the record that would evoke a sense of location, in particular, the open spaces of America. They represented this in the sleeve's photographs depicting them in American desert landscapes and with a lone Yucca brevifolia plant (&quot;Joshua tree&quot;).\n\nThe album received critical acclaim, topped the charts in over 20 countries, and sold in record-breaking numbers. According to Rolling Stone, the album increased the band's stature &quot;from heroes to superstars&quot;. It produced the hit singles &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, &quot;With or Without You&quot;, and &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;. The album won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1988. The group supported the record with the successful Joshua Tree Tour. Frequently cited as one of the greatest albums in rock history, The Joshua Tree is one of the world's all-time best-selling albums, with over 25 million copies sold. In 2007, U2 released a 20th anniversary remastered edition of the record.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;With or Without You&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;In God's Country&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot;  \t\n9.\t&quot;One Tree Hill&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Exit&quot;  \t\n11.\t&quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRattle and Hum 1988\n\n\nRattle and Hum is the name of both an album and a companion documentary style motion picture by Irish rock band U2. Both were released in 1988.\n\nBoth the film and the album contain live recordings, covers, and new songs. To a greater extent than on their previous album, The Joshua Tree, the band explores American Music, and incorporates elements of blues-rock, folk rock, and country. The motion picture was filmed primarily in the United States in late 1987 during the Joshua Tree Tour and it features their experiences with American music. Although Rattle and Hum was intended to represent the band paying tribute to rock legends, some critics accused U2 of trying to place themselves amongst the ranks of these artists. While critical reception was mixed, the album was a commercial success, reaching the #1 spot in several countries with multiplatinum sales.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (Live)\n2.\t&quot;Van Diemen's Land&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Desire&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; (Live)\n6.\t&quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; (Live)\n7.\t&quot;Freedom for My People&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Silver and Gold&quot; (Live)\n9.\t&quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; (Live)\n10.\t&quot;Angel of Harlem&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Love Rescue Me&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Heartland&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;God Part II&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; (Excerpt)\n16.\t&quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; (Live)\n17.\t&quot;All I Want Is You&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAchtung Baby 1991\n\n\nAchtung Baby is the seventh studio album by rock band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 19 November 1991 on Island Records. Stung by the criticism of their 1988 release Rattle and Hum, U2 shifted their musical direction to incorporate alternative rock, industrial, and electronic dance music influences into their sound. Thematically, the album is darker, more introspective, and at times more flippant than the band's previous work. Achtung Baby and the subsequent multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour were central to the group's 1990s reinvention, which replaced their earnest public image with a more lighthearted and self-deprecating one.\n\nSeeking inspiration on the eve of German reunification, U2 began recording Achtung Baby in Berlin's Hansa Studios in October 1990. The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. After weeks of tension and slow progress, the group made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song &quot;One&quot;. They returned to Dublin in 1991, where morale improved and the majority of recordings were completed. The album's title and colourful multi-image sleeve were chosen to confound expectations of U2 and their music.\n\nAchtung Baby is one of U2's most successful records. It earned favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 Top Albums, while topping the charts in many other countries. It spawned five hit singles, including &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, and &quot;The Fly&quot;. The album has sold 18 million copies worldwide and won a Grammy Award in 1993 for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. One of the most acclaimed records of the 1990s, Achtung Baby is regularly featured on lists of the greatest albums of all-time.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Zoo Station&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;One&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Until the End of the World&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;So Cruel&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;The Fly&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Acrobat&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Love Is Blindness&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZooropa 1993\n\n\nZooropa is the eighth studio album by the Irish rock band U2. Produced by Flood, Brian Eno, and The Edge, it was released on 5 July 1993 on Island Records. Inspired by the band's experiences on the Zoo TV Tour, Zooropa expanded on many of the tour's themes of technology and media oversaturation. The record continued the group's experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, Achtung Baby, in 1991.\n\nU2 began writing and recording for Zooropa in Dublin in February 1993, during a six-month break between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The record was originally intended as an EP to promote the &quot;Zooropa&quot; leg of the tour that was to begin in May 1993, but during the sessions, the group decided to extend the record to a full-length LP.[1] Pressed for time, U2 wrote and recorded at a rapid pace, with songs originating from many sources. The album was not completed in time for the tour's resumption, forcing the band to travel between Dublin and their tour destinations in May to complete mixing and recording.\n\nZooropa, much like Achtung Baby, was critically and commercially successful, peaking at number one in several countries, despite none of its three singlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;Lemon&quot;, and &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½being clear hits. In 1994, Zooropa won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Zooropa&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Babyface&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Numb&quot; (The Edge)\n4.\t&quot;Lemon&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Some Days Are Better Than Others&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;The First Time&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Dirty Day&quot; (Bono and The Edge)\n10.\t&quot;The Wanderer&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop 1997\n\n\nPop is the ninth studio album by Irish rock band U2, released in March 1997. The album was a continuation of the band's 1990s reinvention, as they pursued a new musical direction by combining alternative rock, techno, dance, and electronica influences. The album employs a variety of production techniques relatively new to U2, including sampling, loops, programmed drum machines, and sequencing.\n\nRecording sessions began in 1995 with various record producers, including Nellee Hooper, Flood, Howie B, and Steve Osborne, who were introducing the band to various electronica influences. At the time, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. was inactive due to a back injury, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting. Upon Mullen's return, the band began re-working much of their material but ultimately struggled to complete songs. After the band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming 1997 PopMart Tour before the album was completed, U2 were rushed into completing the album. Even after delaying the album's release date from the 1996 Christmas and holiday season to March 1997, U2 ran out of time in the studio and the final product was not to their liking. Since the album's release, many of its songs have been re-recorded and remixed.\n\nAlthough it reached #1 in 35 countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, Pop's lifetime sales are among the lowest in U2's catalogue, and critical reaction was mixed. Pop was certified Platinum by the RIAA on May 5, 1997.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;DiscothÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨que&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Mofo&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Last Night on Earth&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Gone&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Miami&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;The Playboy Mansion&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Please&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll That You Can't Leave Behind 2000\n\n\nAll That You Can't Leave Behind is the tenth studio album by rock band U2. It was released on 30 October 2000 by Island Records in the United Kingdom and Interscope Records in the United States. Following the mixed reception to their 1997 album, Pop, All That You Can't Leave Behind represented a return to a more conventional sound for the band after they experimented with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s. At the time of the album's release, U2 said on a number of occasions that they were &quot;reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world&quot;.[1] U2 brought back producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois who had produced a number of the band's previous albums. The album was originally named &quot;U2000&quot;, which was a working title for their past PopMart Tour.\n\nAll That You Can't Leave Behind has sold over 12 million copies, received wide critical acclaim, and won seven Grammy Awards. The songs &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, &quot;Walk On&quot;, &quot;Elevation&quot;, and &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of&quot; were all successful singles. In 2003, the album was ranked number 139 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.\n\n\nTracks:  \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Beautiful Day&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Elevation&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Walk On&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Kite&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;In a Little While&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Wild Honey&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Peace on Earth&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;When I Look at the World&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;New York&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Grace&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Dismantle and Atomic Bomb 2004\n\n\nHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is the eleventh studio album by Irish rock band U2, released in November 2004. Much like their previous album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb was commercially successful and critically acclaimed and maintains a more traditional rock sound after the band experimented with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s. The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite, with others involved in the production including Flood, Jacknife Lee, Nellee Hooper, Chris Thomas, Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Carl Glanville. The title of the album derives from a lyric in the song &quot;Fast Cars&quot;, which was only available on some versions of the album.\n\nU2 lead singer Bono described the album as &quot;our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years or whatever it is, but this is our first rock album.&quot; [1] Although not a concept album in the traditional sense, most of the music on the record deals with the world at the crossroads of its existence. Love and war, peace and harmony, and approaching death are themes of the album.\n\nHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and its singles won all nine Grammy Awards for which it was nominated (U2 themselves were awarded eight out of the nine). The album also was the fourth biggest selling album of 2004 [2], selling over 9 million copies[3] and yielded several successful singles in &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own&quot;.\n\nThe album was also included in Rolling Stone's list of 100 Best Albums of the Decade at number 68.\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Vertigo&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Miracle Drug&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Love and Peace or Else&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;All Because of You&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Crumbs from Your Table&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;One Step Closer&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Original of the Species&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Yahweh&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Line on the Horizon 2009\n\n\nNo Line on the Horizon is the twelfth studio album by rock band U2. Released on 27 February 2009, it was the band's first record since How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), marking the longest gap between studio albums of U2's career. The band originally intended to release the songs as two EPs, but later combined the material. Photographer Anton Corbijn shot a companion film, Linear, to be released alongside the album and included with several special editions.\n\nU2 began work on the album in 2006 with record producer Rick Rubin, but shelved most of the material from those sessions. From June 2007 to December 2008, the band collaborated with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who produced and co-wrote many of the new songs. Writing and recording took place in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland and Morocco. The group intended to release No Line on the Horizon in November 2008; after composing 50 to 60 songs, they postponed the release because they wanted to continue writing.\n\nPrior to release, U2 indicated that Eno's and Lanois' involvement, as well as the band's time in Fez, Morocco, had resulted in a more experimental record than their previous two albums; the band compared the shift in style to that seen between The Joshua Tree (1987) and Achtung Baby (1991). Upon its release, No Line on the Horizon received generally favourable reviews, although many critics noted that it was not as experimental as previously suggested. The album was not as commercially successful as anticipated, and the band expressed disappointment over the relatively low sales. As of 2010, U2 are supporting the album with the U2 360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Tour.
