Fully replicating all the systems in Train Simulator is simply not possible, but we have added features which bring that dream closer to reality and give you a genuine feeling of what the real locomotive is like.\n\nDynamic exhaust - dense smoke at start-up; colour and density varies with engine load and temperature\nVariable-speed, independent left and right rain-clearing wipers which work with TS2014 rain effects\nSander visual effects\nWorking cab, clipboard and instrument lights\nIndividual horn tones\nRealistic air brake controls with centre return (when controlled from keyboard)\nWorking train length button\nAuto Slow Speed Control to select a slow speed of 0.5MPH, 1MPH, or 2.7MPH. Locomotive will accelerate/decelerate automatically to hold the set speed.\nOperational Slow speedometer \nDriverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key (must be inserted before reverser can be moved)\nAWS/DSD self-test\nEnhanced cab detail and texturing\nCustom couplings\nCustom driver model\nCustom bogie and coupling sounds\nElectronic power control system regulates traction motor current and engine RPM\nAfter emergency brake application due to acknowledging an AWS or DSD alert, there is a 105-second timer before the brakes can be released again\nBrake pressure reaction times and indications react to the amount of rolling stock connected to the locomotive.\n\n\nADVANCED FEATURES IN DETAIL\n\nOperating battery isolating switch\n\nLocated on the locomotive underframe next to the fuel tank, this has three positions:\n\nISOLATE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all electrical systems isolated\nON Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all systems supplied with power\nOFF Ã¢â‚¬â€œ only lights and NRN Radio powered\n\nSubsidiary control panel\nLocated above the left side cab window.\n\nCab lights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ turns on the overhead cab lights\nClipboard light Ã¢â‚¬â€œ adjusts the clipboard light to the left of the driving position to be either Bright or Dim\nInstrument Lights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ OFF/ON turns on the gauge lighting (Dim/Bright operation not simulated)\nAuto-sand isolation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ disables the auto-sanding system. Auto-sand should be disabled when running light engine or with a train of less than 300 tons.\nTail lights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ turns on the two red marker lights at this end of the locomotive.\nLight Indicator LEDs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ five LEDs show the state of the marker, head and tail lights at this end of the locomotive\nHead marker lights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ four-position switch selects between OFF (no white lights); DAY (right-hand headlight, left-hand marker) YARD WORK (both markers) and NIGHT (left-hand headlight, right-hand marker)\nÃ¢â‚¬Æ’\nLeft console\nHorn lever Ã¢â‚¬â€œ selects the hornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high note. For the low note, press [B].\nAuto air brake Ã¢â‚¬â€œ three-position lever. Pull back to release the brakes, push forward to apply. Spring-return to central 'Hold' position.\nDirect brake Ã¢â‚¬â€œ three-position lever. Pull back to release the brake, push forward to apply. Can be left in either position and must be manually returned to the central 'Hold' position.\nTrain length Ã¢â‚¬â€œ used to indicate once the back of the train has passed a certain point. Push the button as the loco passes a location, and you will hear a beep. When the rear of the train passes the same point you will hear a triple beep\nHazard lights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push to activate flashing main headlights to warn oncoming drivers of a hazard on the line.\nEmergency brake plunger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push down to activate emergency braking. Brake pipe pressure will drop to zero and brakes will apply. The plunger will need to be raised again in order to re-pressurise the brake pipe and release the brakes.\nÃ¢â‚¬Æ’\nCentre console\n\nPower Controller Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pull back to apply power. The controller has an 'On' notch. If moved past the 10% position it will remain here for one second Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this makes it easy to locate the notch without looking at the controller. In the 'On' notch the engine RPM will remain at idle but power will be supplied to the traction motors at speeds below 2MPH.\nMaster Switch (Reverser) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has 4 positions:\n   OFF Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Master Key can be inserted/removed\n   REVERSE\n   ENGINE ONLY\n   FORWARD\nAWS Reset Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push to acknowledge an AWS warning.\nMaster key Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Insert into the socket next to the Master Switch in order to unlock the driving desk.\nNRN Radio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push the blue button to initiate a test call. Has red transmit light and working volume control.\n \nInstrument panel - left side\nDuplex main reservoir/main reservoir pipe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ left needle shows main reservoir air pressure, which should remain around 10 bar. Right needle shows main reservoir pipe pressure, which should remain around 7 bar.\nBogie brake cylinder pressure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shows the brake pressure for each of the loco bogies. 0 bar = full release, 4.25 bar = max application.\nBrake pipe/control pipe pressure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ inner needle shows brake pipe pressure, outer needle shows control pipe pressure. Brake pipe should follow control pipe with a delay based on the length of the train. 5 bar = release, 3.4 bar = full service application.\nAWS sunflower Ã¢â‚¬â€œ turns black and yellow to indicate an AWS warning has been acknowledged.\nSpeedometer.\n\nSwitches and lamps\n\nParking brake On Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push to apply parking brake.\nParking brake indicator Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shows if parking brake is on or off.\nParking brake Off Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push to release parking brake.\nAWS isolated Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shows red until AWS test is completed. Can also be clicked to disable AWS/DSD.\nEngine stopped Ã¢â‚¬â€œ red light if RPM below 190.\nWheel slip Ã¢â‚¬â€œ red light if wheels are slipping.\nGeneral fault Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will illuminate red if slow speed is enabled with the power controller higher than 'On'. To clear, move power controller to 'Off'.\nAuto-sanding Ã¢â‚¬â€œ red light indicates that auto-sanding is isolated on the subsidiary control panel.\n\nInstrument panel - right side\n\nGauges:\n\nSlow Speedometer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ only active when slow speed control is enabled. Shows speed from 0-3 MPH.\nAmmeter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shows traction current. The electronic engine control system will limit amps to a max of 6,800.\nAir flowmeter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shows the rate at which air is flowing into the train pipe. If brakes are being released it will read 0. If brakes are applying it will read off the scale. With the auto air brake lever in the 'Hold' position it should show a reading proportional to the number of wagons in the consist.\nControls:\n\nSlow Speed Control Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a four-position switch, with settings for Off, 0.5MPH, 1MPH and 2.7MPH. To enable slow speed, move the power controller to 'Off', select your desired speed and then move the power controller to 'On'. Moving the power controller above the 'On' notch with slow speed engaged will cause a loss of power and the General Fault light will turn red. To restore power move the power controller to 'Off' and then back to 'On'.\nLeft and right windscreen wiper controls Ã¢â‚¬â€œ use to adjust the speed of the left-hand/right-hand windscreen wipers.\nEngine Start Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push to start engine.\nEngine Stop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push to stop engine.\nFire alarm test Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push to test the fire alarm bell.\nGuard buzzer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ push to activate the driver/guard signalling buzzer.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nIn the case of an emergency brake application due to the driver failing to acknowledge an AWS or DSD alert, there is a 105-second timer before the brakes can be released again.\nThe electronic power control system regulates traction motor current and engine RPM according to the setting of the power controller and the railhead conditions. If wheelslip is detected, power will automatically be reduced until adhesion improves.\nWhen auto-sanding a dispensing sand effect is seen at the wheels.\nExternal rain on glass. This will be cleared by operating the windscreen wipers.\n\nCOACHES\n\nThis package includes three types of Mk.1 coach created by Just Trains, all complete with passenger view, a unique leaking steam effect from the coach heating system and connecting vacuum hose pipes and steam heat pipes when used with compatible steam locomotives like the Just Trains Standard 4MT Advanced. \n\nThe Mk.1 coaches are in a brown and cream livery in the following versions:\n\nBrake Standard Open\nFirst Open\nTourist Standard Open\n\nYGB SEACOW ADVANCED\n\nThe YGB Seacow is a ballast hopper which is used throughout the rail system, transporting and dispensing track bed gravel to track workers.
