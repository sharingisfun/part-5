But a deeply unfunny thing happened to him on the way to Japan. The 1940 games were canceled. Mr. Zamperini became an Air Force lieutenant. And he wound up going to Japan not as a miler but as a savagely abused prisoner of war.\n\nYet through torment after hellish torment, he demonstrated the kind of survival skills that would make Paul Bunyan look like a marshmallow in comparison. And Laura Hillenbrand, the author of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeabiscuit,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ knows a winner when she sees one. Ms. Hillenbrand has given Mr. Zamperini the full ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeabiscuitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ treatment in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnbroken,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which is only her second book.\n\nThe ideal way to read ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnbrokenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ would be with absolutely no knowledge of how Mr. ZamperiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life unfolded. Ms. Hillenbrand has written her book so breathlessly, and with such tight focus, that she makes it difficult to guess what will happen to him from one moment to the next, let alone how long he was able to survive under extreme duress. But blinders are for horses, not for readers of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnbroken.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So we must acknowledge the good news that Mr. Zamperini is now a snappy 93, and better able to promote this book than its author (who is often sidelined by her chronic fatigue syndrome). HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on YouTube. The words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSurvival,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œResilienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRedemptionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are part of the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s subtitle. And Mr. Zamperini, strongly influenced by Billy Graham more than 50 years ago, has been treating his story as an inspirational tale ever since. Hollywood has had its eye on him for so long that the young Tony Curtis was once scheduled to play the starring role on screen.\n\nThe Louie Zamperini story has been crammed with excitement right from the start. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOutraces DeathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ read a caption with his picture in The New York Times on Sept. 9, 1945, when this athleteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suffering and survival became big news. His adventure, The Times said, in wording so revealing about postwar euphoria, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfollowed the usual raft story pattern, except that it eclipsed them all in endurance.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ And endurance is what Ms. Hillenbrand has made ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnbrokenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ all about.\n\nJust as she demonstrated in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeabiscuit,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ms. Hillenbrand is a muscular, dynamic storyteller, never using an ordinary verb when a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œteeming,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbuffetedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œporpoisingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will do. Her command of the action-adventure idiom is more than enough to hold interest. But she happens also to have located a tale full of unforgettable characters, multi-hanky moments and wild turns. And if some of it sounds too much like pulp fiction to be true, Ms. Hillenbrand has also done a bang-up research job. She interviewed Mr. Zamperini more than 75 times. He has an excellent memory. And he is a pack rat nonpareil: his scrapbook covering the years 1917-1938 is a single book that weighs 63 pounds. Most memorably Ms. Hillenbrand persuaded a man from the Army Air Forces Historical Association to bring a once-top-secret Norden bombsight of the type used in World War II bombers to her house, set it up with a screen of Arizona and teach her how to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbombÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Phoenix.\n\nMy other torrents:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/insane86&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/insane86&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:053f78ec85fc7dacbf714a078d093d552ea48f76","amp;dn":"Unbroken+by+Laura+Hillenbrand+%28epub+%2B+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"053f78ec85fc7dacbf714a078d093d552ea48f76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,63,120,236,133,252,125,172,191,113,74,7,141,9,61,85,46,164,143,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
