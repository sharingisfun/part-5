Full Windows XP (nothing is removed)\n\n#\n\n 2. TinyXP (large components removed, but usable for most)\n\n#\n\n 3. MicroXP (extremely small, only takes 221Mb of HDD space)\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n All three versions are updated to February 2010.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n There are also three more boot options:\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n 4. Acronis True Image EES v9.7.8353 (Backup\\Restore)\n\n#\n\n 5. Hiren's BootCD v10.1 (Includes Live Windows XP)\n\n#\n\n 6. SpinRite v6.1 (Hard Disk Testing and Repair)\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Tons of drivers included!\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n After the first reboot, on all installations, you will see a pop up\n\n#\n\n &quot;Driver Selector&quot; window, This has a 1 minute timer. If the minute\n\n#\n\n counts down, you will get important driverpacks included.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n This selector has a lot of drivers and you can pick and choose any\n\n#\n\n combination you want, but remember that you must be sat at the PC\n\n#\n\n after the first reboot.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n All three choices include 22 different driverpacks, all are optional,\n\n#\n\n but you will always get basic drivers included even if the timer is\n\n#\n\n left to count down. That is, CPU, Chipset, LAN, Mass Storage, Sound,\n\n#\n\n the main nVidia and ATI graphics drivers and Wireless LAN.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Even if you choose to create a smaller CD sized ISO (which you can\n\n#\n\n easily do by just double clicking a batch file in the ISO folder on\n\n#\n\n this DVD) those still include drivers and the driver selector, but\n\n#\n\n they are on a 700Mb CD so have to have less driver packs.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Options 1 and 2\n\n#\n\n ---------------\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n - NOT unattended.\n\n#\n\n - You do not require any product key\n\n#\n\n - Allows you to do a &quot;Repair&quot; installation\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n You can install Windows the way you want, choose your own username,\n\n#\n\n regional and language options etc.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Option 2\n\n#\n\n --------\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Option 2 is TinyXP Rev10 (February 2010).\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n This is usable for most people, but it does not include Chinese,\n\n#\n\n Japanese or Korean languages. It also has a lot of other things\n\n#\n\n removed that are classed as a waste of resources, or just bulky\n\n#\n\n and useless. For example the upgrade option is removed, since\n\n#\n\n only a clean install is advised, also the Tour is removed, MSN\n\n#\n\n Explorer and many other items, but whilst keeping all of the\n\n#\n\n functionality (services) in Windows. This means you get a smaller\n\n#\n\n install and it uses less RAM, but you get almost the whole of\n\n#\n\n Windows and will not miss anything taken out.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n To see whats removed from TinyXP, see the file here:\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n XP02I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n You should only install this Windows onto a freshly formatted\n\n#\n\n partition or hard disk.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Option 3\n\n#\n\n --------\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Option 3 is not for the faint hearted, it is an extremely small edition\n\n#\n\n of Windows with a lot of components removed. I actually use it myself\n\n#\n\n though, as my main OS. It seems to do everything I need it to do.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n There are advantages to MicroXP:\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n - Extremely fast installation\n\n#\n\n - Fast to scan for viruses\n\n#\n\n - Making a backup is fast\n\n#\n\n - Defragmenting is fast\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Those are just some advantages - the OS is also less prone to viruses\n\n#\n\n because there are so few files left to attack and it runs very fast.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n This boots up in probably a third of the time of normal Windows XP.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n This installation is unattended and set to US English, but you can\n\n#\n\n change the country for your keyboard afterwards.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n You should only install this Windows onto a freshly formatted\n\n#\n\n partition or hard disk.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Included driverpacks:\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n BlueTooth (42.60 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Broadband (16.20 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Chipset (11.50 Mb)\n\n#\n\n CPU (148.00 Kb)\n\n#\n\n Graphics A (297.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Graphics B (375.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Graphics C (587.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Input Devices (56.90 Mb)\n\n#\n\n LAN Ethernet (50.20 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Mass Storage (32.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Miscellaneous (52.10 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Modem (177.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Monitor (95.10 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Phone (15.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Scanner (13.90 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Sound A (182.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Sound B (280.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n TV Card (75.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n USB Devices (2.69 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Virtual (8.42 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Webcam (221.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n Wireless LAN (158.00 Mb)\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n Sizes above are for the uncompressed drivers on your hard disk.\n\n#\n\n \n\n#\n\n The drivers that get copied to your hard disk are only there\n\n#\n\n during setup and will be removed again afterwards.

When it encounters\n\n#\n\n a sector with errors that cannot be corrected by the disk drive's error\n\n#\n\n correcting code, it tries to read the sector up to 2000 times, and\n\n#\n\n tries to determine the most probable value of each bit by comparing\n\n#\n\n the results.
