Where a desperate Time Lord calls directory enquiries in search of his sworn arch-enemy and Alan Bennett and Thora Hird are the kind of thugs you most certainly wouldn't share your buttered scones with.\n\n\n\n\nDead Ringers - S01 - (4x30 Minutes)\n\nDead Ringers - S02 - (8x30 Minutes) \n\nDead Ringers - S03 - (6x30 Minutes)\n \nDead Ringers - S04 - (5x30 Minutes) \n \nDead Ringers - S05 - (3x30 Minutes)\n[b]Dead Ringers - S05 - E04 - (Never Broadcast, 9-11)[/b]\n\nDead Ringers - S06 - (7x30 Minutes)\n\nDead Ringers - S07 - (5x30 Minutes)\n\nDead Ringers - S08 - (4x30 Minutes)\n\nDead Ringers - S09 - (4x30 Minutes)\n\nDead Ringers - S10 - (5x30 Minutes)\n\nDead Ringers - S11 - (6x30 Minutes)\n\nDead Ringers - S12 - (6x30 Minutes) \n \nDead Ringers - S13 - (2x30 Minutes) \n \nDead Ringers - S14 - (5x30 Minutes) \n \nDead Ringers - S15 - (5x30 Minutes)\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d3f607cdb3386b2d650f05ec41f92c88333cadb","amp;dn":"Dead+Ringers+-+S01+to+15+-+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d3f607cdb3386b2d650f05ec41f92c88333cadb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,63,96,124,219,51,134,178,214,80,240,94,196,31,146,200,131,51,202,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
