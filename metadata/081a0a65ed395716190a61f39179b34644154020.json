However, her songwriting skills were on display even on GallowsbirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bark, where her song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bright Blue TieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was one of the lower-key standouts among the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical sleights of hand. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not surprising, then, that Friedberger's solo debut Last Summer recalls the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album and expands on that songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lilting melody and wryly detailed lyrics. A few tracks feel like they were crowded out of the Furnaces' brimming catalog, particularly Ã¢â‚¬Å“Inn of the Seventh Ray,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which boasts some jaunty pianos and travelog lyrics that are decidedly Fiery, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Heaven,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which makes Friedberger's knack for pop melodies literal by sounding like a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s soda jingle. Meanwhile, the charm that makes the Furnaces' trickier moments ultimately winning shows up in spades on Ã¢â‚¬Å“My MistakesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Fall Apart on You Tonight,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ perhaps the most accessible songs Friedberger has ever sung. Fortunately, though, Last Summer doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trace the lines of her work with her brother too closely. Instead, she reveals a softer, more personal approach that melds singer/songwriter intimacy with her innate wit. Her voice caresses lines like Ã¢â‚¬Å“he shaved off his beard/and saw The Girl Who Played with Fire&quot; on the lovely Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scenes from Bensonhurst,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and disparages Ã¢â‚¬Å“Glitter Gold YearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s annus horribilus with a twist: Ã¢â‚¬Å“You said it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be so bad/But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Friedberger keeps most of her stories close to home, chronicling everyday New York adventures in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roosevelt IslandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“One-Month Marathon,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but the instrumentation she surrounds them with is far-flung. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Early EarthquakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a potent reminder of how commanding she is with just a guitar and some percussion behind her, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“OwlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Head ParkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ fuses strings, synths, saxophone, and layers of vocals into something lush, sophisticated, and miles away from FriedbergerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band. While Last Summer has enough ties to her work with the Fiery Furnaces to please fans, it gives Friedberger the time in the spotlight she deserves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081a0a65ed395716190a61f39179b34644154020","amp;dn":"Eleanor+Friedberger+-+Last+Summer+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081a0a65ed395716190a61f39179b34644154020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,26,10,101,237,57,87,22,25,10,97,243,145,121,179,70,68,21,64,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
