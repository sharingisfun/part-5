Go to the DLC Packer/Unpacker tab and unpack your DLC (anything that you OWN inside your content folder) .. then open the APP_ID file with notepad and copy the number inside there\n\n2. then fill in that number in the textfield (theres the APP ID from the song Damnit)\n\n3. then select the folder where you'd like all the output we are going to get (make this something else then the folder where all your DLC's are) - SavePath\n\n4. and click bulk repack and then select the folder where you have all your downloaded DLC's \n\n(make sure the only files inside that folder are .dat files, else the program will probably crash (I didn't program any error checking))\nthen click Bulk Repack.. now it may look like the program is hanging or going to crash but it won't, it's just busy repacking your DLC's\n\n\n\nWhat it's doing now is.. unpacking all the DLC's you have in that folder.. editing the APP_ID number and repacking them again.. Just look inside the folder.. you'll notice when it's done \nthen copy all the .dat files to your content folder and voila.. got all DLC's on legit rocksmith","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3456c257dacae7b1b19d2d24943f77cd2b8f20be","amp;dn":"Rocksmith+DLC+-+ALL+SONGS%2876%29+%2B+Repacker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3456c257dacae7b1b19d2d24943f77cd2b8f20be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,86,194,87,218,202,231,177,177,157,45,36,148,63,119,205,43,143,32,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
