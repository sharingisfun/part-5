This was obviously on everybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind, because this second Burnett-produced album updates the sound a decade or so into a mesh of folky honky tonk, garage rock, and girl group ballads, with a touch of Daniel Lanois-like swampy noodling on a few tracks, making Put Your Needle Down sound a bit like Emmylou HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Lanois-produced Wrecking Ball as sung by the Everly BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ little sisters while fronting the Cowboy Junkies.\nThat may sound like a mess, but it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and this album grows on you as it progresses, with the sistersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ assured singing (and songwriting Ã¢â‚¬â€ they co-wrote many of the songs here) making everything cohere and shine. At the center of things is an old Bob Dylan song called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dirty Lie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ previously only heard as an unfinished Dylan demo. Given permission by Dylan to finish the song, it emerges here as a striking Ã¢â‚¬Å“St. James InfirmaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-like jewel with a dark, murky jazz-blues feel. Not much about this album is country, really, with the swampy, haunting Ã¢â‚¬Å“Iuka,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a sisters original co-write, sounding like a Cowboy Junkies track gone deep into Mississippi folk or blues territory (the sisters are from Alabama, by the way), and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a neat late-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢50s, early-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s girl group feel to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black and Blue,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ while Boudleaux BryantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lonely Island,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one of the coolest tracks here, sounds exactly like a female version of the Everly Brothers singing a classic 1950s girl group ballad. This set might not be as insularly perfect as \nThe Secret SistersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ first album, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimately just as impressive, if not more so, breaking the duo out of that Ã¢â‚¬Å“honky tonk made of fine glassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feel that could have easily trapped them creatively and artistically. This set breaks that bind and means the Secret Sisters have the freedom to go anywhere from here, and whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musically forward or back in time really matters little with this kind of talent. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice to know that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not about to stand still.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14399d137f1de8aa11aec30ccfd26f031023f758","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Sisters+-+Put+Your+Needle+Down+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14399d137f1de8aa11aec30ccfd26f031023f758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,57,157,19,127,29,232,170,17,174,195,12,207,210,111,3,16,35,247,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
