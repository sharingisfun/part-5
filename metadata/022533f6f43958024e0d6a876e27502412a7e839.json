With his reassuring, â€œyou can do itâ€ attitude, he goes out of his way to show readers how to create realistic design elements that they can implement with basic tools and a little DIY experience. His mission is to bring peopleâ€™s imaginations to life. The design features he constructs use materials easily found, are budget-conscious, and whenever possible environmentally friendly. In Carterâ€™s Way, he decodes the time-tested principles of design, using specific examples and stunning photos to visually illustrate his points.\r\n\r\nEach chapter will cover a different area of the house, acknowledging the diversity of layouts in todayâ€™s homes. For example, one chapter will focus on spaces for cooking, eating, and socializing to appeal both to people with a formal dining area and those with more open floor plans, with a design that is about comfort, entertaining, and practicality. Other chapters include: intimate bedroom spaces featuring beautiful and efficient storage for a sensual environment that becomes a sanctuary; living/family rooms with the kind of versatility that allows them to convert from game-playing rumpus rooms to elegant cocktail party spaces; luxurious bathrooms that provide a spa-like getaway from stress while also conserving energy and water; home offices/entryways/laundry rooms; and outdoor spaces that can serve as two- or three-season rooms for entertaining and relaxing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:022533f6f43958024e0d6a876e27502412a7e839","amp;dn":"Carters+Way+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"022533f6f43958024e0d6a876e27502412a7e839","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,37,51,246,244,57,88,2,78,13,106,135,110,39,80,36,18,167,232,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
