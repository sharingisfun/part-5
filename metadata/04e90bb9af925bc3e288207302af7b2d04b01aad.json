Providence \nIn the old world shadows of Providence, Rhode Island, Nina Grey finds herself the center of a war between Hell and Earth. Struggling with her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent death, Nina meets Jared Ryel by chanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or so she believes. Although his stunning good looks and mysterious talents are a welcome distraction, it soon becomes clear that Jared knows more about Nina than even her friends at Brown University. When questions outnumber answers, Jared risks everything to keep the woman he was born to saveÃ¢â‚¬â€by sharing the secret he was sworn to protect. When her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former associates begin following her in the dark, Nina learns that her father is not the man she thought he was, but a thief who stole from demons. Searching for the truth behind her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, Nina stumbles upon something she never expectedÃ¢â‚¬â€something Hell wantsÃ¢â‚¬â€and only she holds the key. \n\n2. Requiem \nJared paced, brooded, and once in a while, when his thoughts were particularly tormented, he winced. The color had long left his face as he played back the different scenarios in his mind. Back and forth he paced, so many times that I watched the floor, wondering when he would wear a trail. His inner turmoil could have set the room on fire. It was unbearable to watch, but I couldn't leave him; not when he was planning my death.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dreaming of the dead might mean a restless night for anyone, but for Nina Grey it was a warning. Still healing from her last run-in with Hell, Nina struggles with not only her life as a Brown University student, but also as an intern at Titan Shipping, her father's company. Recurring nightmares about her father's violent death have become a nightly event, but being overwhelmed with guilt from Ryan's unexpected departure to the Armed Forces, and heart ache over Claire being across the ocean to protect him, Nina believes her sleepless nights are the least of her problemsÃ¢â‚¬â€but she's wrong. Worried about Nina's declining health, Jared must steal back Shax's book for answers. Fighting new enemies, and with the help of new friends, Jared's worst fear comes to fruition. Desperate, he is faced with a choice: Fight Hell alone, or start a war with Heaven. \n\n3. Eden \nShe had seen the unspeakable. \nShe would learn the unknowable. \nNow, she would fight the invincible. \nIn the third and final installment of the Providence series, Nina Grey will marry the wrong man, carry the child that was never supposed to be born, and fight a war she can't win. \nFaced with the impossible task of protecting his new wife and unborn child against the throes of Hell, Jared Ryel is allowed no mistakes. Pressured to return the Naissance de Demoniac to Jerusalem, he revisits St. Ann's to learn the answers were in front of him all along. \nTogether, they must survive long enough to let their child save them - and the world. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04e90bb9af925bc3e288207302af7b2d04b01aad","amp;dn":"The+Providence+Trilogy+by+Jamie+McGuire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04e90bb9af925bc3e288207302af7b2d04b01aad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,233,11,185,175,146,91,195,226,136,32,115,2,175,123,45,4,176,26,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
