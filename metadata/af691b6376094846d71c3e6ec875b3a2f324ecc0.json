Subsequently placed in an internment camp, the wayward travelers are quickly rescued by the town's sympathetic mayor, who bestows upon them a plot of land where they can live without fear of harassment. Later, as the Gypsies grow increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of living in one place, the Gestapo arrests the mayor and a local teacher for resistance. Fearing that they, too, are about to lose their freedom should they decide to remain in town, the Gypsies quickly decide that their best option is to try their luck on the road, and they quietly take flight.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Korkoro.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,121,591,296 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:51:44\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x304 (AR: 2.368)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1203 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.229 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1495823/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1495823/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: French, German (some dialogue), Romany\nSubtitles: English (idx/sub)\n\nPosted originally at KG by rickytintin, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af691b6376094846d71c3e6ec875b3a2f324ecc0","amp;dn":"Tony+Gatlif+-+Korkoro+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af691b6376094846d71c3e6ec875b3a2f324ecc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,105,27,99,118,9,72,70,215,28,62,110,200,117,179,162,243,36,236,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
