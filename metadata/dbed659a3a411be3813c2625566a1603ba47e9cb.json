Heathrow is the\nlatest creation of the next generation of\nproducts from UK2000 Scenery and is simply\nthe best yet!\n\nHeathrow Airport is the busiest international airport in the\nworld. With over Half a Million polygons, 250MB of graphics\ndata, it really is Xtreme scenery!. But dont let the size put\nyou off, the FPS (frame per second is faster than the older\nand less detailed Heathrow Pro). On a modern PC the FS9\nversion can achive over 100fps, and even with 200AI you get\n30fps.FSX is of cause a slower sim, as such it will be slower\nbut still far beter than any other Heathrow version.\nNew VERSION2 released 25th August 2010\n\nWhats new in version2?\n\n1) T5C added, new T5c stands added, including new A380 tripple jeyway stands\n2) T5B and T5A changes to models+new buildings.\n3) Heathrow East, start of building work, old 'G' stands closed.\n4) Terminal 2 closed, parts demolished, also parts of T1 modified.\n6) Old BA hanger demolished, now is a large parking area.\n7) New front to T4, New Qantas departure lounge and A380 stands.\n8) New lighting system added, curves improved and some new ground textures.\n9) Heathrow taxiway layout changes.\n10) New better designed AFD files. FSX now has 'rain' effect taxiways.\nand hundreds of others changes and improvements, far too many to list!\n\nHave fun Guys :+)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbed659a3a411be3813c2625566a1603ba47e9cb","amp;dn":"FSX+UK2000+Heathrow+Extreme+V2.0+EGLL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbed659a3a411be3813c2625566a1603ba47e9cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,237,101,154,58,65,27,227,129,60,38,37,86,106,22,3,186,71,233,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
