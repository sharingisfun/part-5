Karslake about homosexuality and its perceived conflict with Christianity, as well as various interpretations of what the Bible says about same-sex sexuality.\n\nIt includes lengthy interview segments with several sets of religious parents (including former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt and his wife, Jane, and the parents of Bishop V. Gene Robinson) regarding their personal experiences raising homosexual children, and also interviews with those (adult) children.\n\nThe film features an animated segment, &quot;Is Homosexuality a Choice?&quot;, in which a summary of the current scientific theories about sexual orientation is given. It is directed by Powerhouse Animation Studios and narrated by Don LaFontaine in one of his last non-trailer narration roles.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received 98% positive reviews, based on 43 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 11 reviews.\n\nFollowing its premiere in competition at the Sundance Film Festival, For the Bible Tells Me So went on to win a number of prestigious festival awards including the Katherine Bryan Edwards Human Rights Prize at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, and the Best Documentary Audience Awards at the Seattle International Film Festival, the Provincetown International Film Festival, Outfest: The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the Milwaukee International Film Festival, and a number of others.\n\nOn November 19, 2007, For the Bible Tells Me So was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as one of 15 films on its documentary feature Oscar shortlist. However, it did not make the final list of five nominated films as announced on January 22, 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba82bc92efe5ded80c18148008c46bbfec9c7477","amp;dn":"For+the+Bible+Tells+Me+So+%5B2007%5D+Docu+on+Homosexuality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba82bc92efe5ded80c18148008c46bbfec9c7477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,130,188,146,239,229,222,216,12,24,20,128,8,196,107,191,236,156,116,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
