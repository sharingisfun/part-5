Serious gameplay surrounded by a light-hearted atmosphere, designed to evoke the feel of history's great RPGs and dice-slinging adventures around the tabletop.\n- True roguelike adventure: turn-based, tough but fair, countless combat options.\n- More than 75 unique player abilities.\n- 12 different styles of Dungeons and Battlefields with more on the way.\n- Six class archetypes to mix and match.\n- 50+ enemies, including the fearsome Triger!\n- The Dungeonmans Academy, your home base that grows with each play.\n- A world-class soundtrack brimming with music straight from the era of RPG classics. \nIn an untamed wilderness, where civilization lives in the shadow of fearsome beasts and lawless villainy, the only light against the darkness are the courageous Dungeonmens! With cunning minds, mighty thews and iron wills, these great heroes and heroines are dedicated toward exploring the unknown, taming the wild, and crushing the fiercest of beasts.\nAdventure begins at the Dungeonmans Academy, an ever-growing bastion of learning that expands and evolves based on the efforts of its graduates. As heroes return from their journeys burdened by giant piles of precious loot and ancient wisdom, the Academy grows and future graduates are able to take advantage of this knowledge, starting with a leg up on their quest to avenge the bold graduates who fell in previous battles.\nThe vast overworld teems with adventure! There are indeed dungeons deep and plentiful, but also dripping swamps, deathless crypts, huddled warrens, forest camps of bandits and highwaymen, ancient towers ruled by powerful despots, and even more terrible dangers waiting in the darkest shadows. A Dungeonmans rises to the challenge with a healthy mix of Skills and Masteries, fighting up close, at range, with steel and spell alike. Unfettered by 'class restrictions', a Dungeonmans chooses the right tools for the battles ahead.&quot;\n\nChangelog:\nv1.5.2a:\n- A fix for the hotbar / skill swapping crash people were experiencing.\nv1.5.2:\nNew Town Layouts\n- Towns now have randomized layouts and additional shops. A few new variant shop layouts were added, and in general most shops should be physically smaller and easier to navigate.\n- The Inn has returned! While not fully functional yet, you can now get a night of rest at an Inn and be granted an XP bonus that should last until your next dungeon or so. Probably too long!\nSpiral Dungeon Floors\n- Rarely, and in more difficult dungeons, you may encounter a floor that is a concentric maze, with twisting narrow hallways, multiple side doors, and a great deal of treasure.\n- The floors are large, perhaps too large. If you encounter one please send in feedback after (if?) you make it to the center stairwell.\n- In future builds, there will likely be an Ancient King stationed at the center.\nTwo New Hero Sprites\n- Introducing Cham and The Duelist, two new Lady Dungeonmens ready to dive into adventure and get slaughtered like everyone else.\nEngine Work: Item Save Data\n- IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m testing out a new method of loading and saving item data that should allow for any item version to be loaded, even ones from saves before Early Access started! If this proves effective IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be using this same concept\nEngine Work: Post-Game Dungeon\n- There is nothing player-accessible yet, but more work has been done on creating a post game experience that will scale far past the level cap and provide super crunchy monster crushing for the dedicated dungeon delver.\n\nFor the full changelog, see changelog.txt.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/288120/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/288120/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dungeonmans.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dungeonmans.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8427a1ee69d9a84fc8118a8e21eceb9dd075c0c","amp;dn":"Dungeonmans+v1.5.2a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8427a1ee69d9a84fc8118a8e21eceb9dd075c0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,66,122,30,230,157,154,132,252,129,24,168,226,30,206,185,221,7,92,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
