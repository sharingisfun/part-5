Thus Morrison pitched the idea of Animal Man, originally as a four issue mini-series. Strong sales however, meant DC asked Morrison to continue his series an ongoing, which he did for 26 issues. During his run, Morison incorporated themes such as animal rights and vegetarianism as well as fourth-wall breaking story lines which ended in Morrison inserting himself into the comic and directly speaking to Animal Man and revealing his status as a fictional character. Morrison's series re-invented Buddy Baker as a suburban family man and &quot;average Joe&quot; character, he also introduced a new Mirror Master (McCulloch).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb47004aa251feb01385de45a7221f114c16afdb","amp;dn":"Animal+Man+%28001+-+089%29+%281988+-+1995%29+%28Digital%2BScans%29+%28Empire%2BDCP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb47004aa251feb01385de45a7221f114c16afdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,71,0,74,162,81,254,176,19,133,222,69,167,34,31,17,76,22,175,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
