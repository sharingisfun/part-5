Talsorian Games.\n\nThis role-playing game is based on the works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, and other authors of the &quot;Mirrorshades group&quot;. The game includes a number of elements now associated with the 1980s[citation needed], such as the idea of &quot;style over substance&quot; and glam rock. The fictional timeline, trying to depict an early 21st century from a 1980s perspective, contains some anachronisms such as not foreseeing the adoption of cell phones as the preferred mode of communication.\n\nThe game tends to emphasize some aspects of the source material more than others. Much of the focus of the game is paid to combat, high tech weaponry and cybernetic modification; however, performance enhancing and recreational drug use is either played down or discouraged. Although artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and cloning are barely mentioned in the core rulebook they are reintroduced in later add-ons such as the chromebook manuals.\n\nThe range of characters players can adopt is very diverse, ranging from hardwired mercenaries with psycholinked weapons and boosted reflexes, to Armani-wearing corporate mega-yuppies who make and break national economies with the stroke of a pen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5df8ee80357ca2537e4b62baaf078b7dd5fb3bb","amp;dn":"Cyberpunk+2020-Collezione+di+Manuali-Pdf-Ita-TNTVillage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5df8ee80357ca2537e4b62baaf078b7dd5fb3bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,223,142,232,3,87,202,37,55,228,182,43,170,240,120,183,221,95,179,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
