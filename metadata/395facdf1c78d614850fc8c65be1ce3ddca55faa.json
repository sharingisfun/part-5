This record is not for the folks who like light hearted rockin tunes like &quot;Ramrod&quot; or &quot;Cadiallac Ranch&quot;...this is something completely different and very intimate. Bruce was at a crossroads when he made this record...46 years old, just had a mini reunion with the E street Band for a couple of tracks on the greatest hits...but he was struggling to find &quot;his rock voice&quot; at that time....his singing style suggests this on Joad. Instead of doing the commerically obvious choice (reunite the band, record and tour) he chose to follow his muse...and no matter what you think of the actual record, you have to respect that. Springsteen chose to talk about America's poor through the voices of Mexican immigrants, veterans, lonely souls. This album is rich with the soil of america's past and conects Steinbecks world to the present day America. Its a deep and scary record....its truly amazing how Springsteen steps inside each characters world....he may be a millionare, but you would never know it listening to this CD.\n\nThe songs:\n\nTitle cut is amazing, connecting the world of Steinbeck to now...still poor in America and getting worse (thanks Dubbya!)\n\n2. Straight Time: the character in this song is trying to find whats lost...and how sometimes the things that make us happy are not healthy things....ex con deals with the real world and trys to walk the straight line...amazing lyrics!\n\n3. Highway 29- an affair gone terribly wrong...sung by a ghost...i think\n\n4. Youngstown- America during Reagan (and now) industry and out sourcing...jobs gone....amazing song.\n\n5. Sinaloa Cowboys, brings you into a world that not many of us know exsisted...Mexican immigrants\n\n6. The line, again a beautiful character study...life is not so black and white, Bruce tells us threw this border patrol widower.\n\n7. Balboa park, again the work of immigrants, Mexican boys selling themselves for money and drugs....hard life, dark song.\n\n8.Dry Lighting, talking about men and women, one of my favorites on the CD\n\n9. The new timer, riding the rails....\n\n10. across the border, is there salavation in the mix?\n\n11. Galvaston Bay, Vietnam vets vs Vietnamise immigrants...brilliant.\n\n12. my best was never good enough....lighter fair than the rest of the cd but I guess he had to end on somewhat of a light note.\n\nThere really isn't enough room to really go into track by track, bottom line is I bought the CD when it first came out and I was floored....Bruce really makes you feel the lives of this characters....its really his best work, yes I love to rock out to the E street band too, but thats not what this CD is about...everyone should own this...amazing thanks Bruce!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395facdf1c78d614850fc8c65be1ce3ddca55faa","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+The+Gost+of+Tom+Joad%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395facdf1c78d614850fc8c65be1ce3ddca55faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,95,172,223,28,120,214,20,133,15,200,198,91,225,206,61,220,165,95,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
