Today, as I post this, it has been exactly 75 years since then - of amazing stories, timeless villains, fantastic films and thrilling television, and even recently some great games and much more - all about the Dark Knight and his family of costumed fighters. Celebrate this pop culture icon with the ones that started it all - his first appearances as well as the first seven issues of his title run. These are all-digital editions of the landmark issues - the Detective Comics stuff is Batman stories only, thanks to Monfekk-Empire, and the Batman stuff is G85-Empire's works. Thanks SO MUCH to the scanner groups for these awesome copies, please enjoy and seed - and long live the Caped Crusader and the Dynamic Duo forevermore! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0310853ec5eb6e8a9f51ece616b36652dc09768f","amp;dn":"Detective+Comics+27-33+%2B+Batman+01-07+%281939-1941%7CDgtl%7CG85%2BM-E%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0310853ec5eb6e8a9f51ece616b36652dc09768f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,16,133,62,197,235,110,138,159,81,236,230,22,179,102,82,220,9,118,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
