Internal filters are not registered to user's system to keep it from being messed up with system filters.\n\nThe KMPlayer includes almost all the essential decoders required for media playback. Furthermore, to get beyond the limitation of internal decoders, the external ones such as commercial h.264 decoders or cyberlink/intervideo audio decoders can be specified, so that KMP works optimally by the users' own customization. Even though the KMP is based upon directshow structure, it supports Winamp, Realmedia and Quicktime by the internal logic. \nThus, it is possible to specify where to try to connect firstly the media in preferences. \n\nIn short, the player provides a strong hybrid structure efficient for interconnecting various directshow filters, winamp input&amp;dsp plugin, and internal filters. The most outstanding feature is that the player has the full control of filter connections to prevent a media playback from being messed.\n\nThe player can set multifarious audio and video effects, slow down or increase playback speed with regular tone, select parts of a video as favorites, do an exceptionally powerful A-B repeat, remap the keys of remote interface for HTPC including overlay screen controls, change a skin dynamically depending on a media type playing, and many more. It is completely customizable thanks to a wide selection of skins and color schemes, and the configuration options are extremely extensive.\n\n\nKMPlayer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen Album ArtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nThe KMPlayer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen Album ArtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ provides a preview of the video thumbnail, which allows users to view videos in an easier and in a more comfortable manner.\n\nThe user previously had to look for files in where the videos were saved. However, KMPlayer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen Album ArtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ now allows users to simply click on the \npreview of video thumbnail, on KMPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s main page for a better appreciation of the videos. The user can now choose the display options between the album art form \nand the list of thumbnail form. Moreover, once having watched the video, the user can delete the video by clicking on the [delete] button. Such a service allows \nusers to manage videos in an easier and in a more comfortable manner.\n\nLast but not least, KMPlayer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen Album ArtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ also provides remote control and a wireless keyboard.
