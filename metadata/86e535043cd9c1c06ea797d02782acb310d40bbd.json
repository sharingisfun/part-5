Fleming\nPublished: 2014\nPublisher: Association for Supervision &amp; Curriculum Development\nISBN: 9781416617266\nFormat: Retail PDF\n\n\nWe decide, every day, whether we are going to turn students on or off to science and mathematics in our classrooms. \nDaily decisions about how to incorporate creativity, choice, and autonomy integral components of engagement can build students self-efficacy, keep them motivated, and strengthen their identities as scientists and mathematicians. In this book, Eric Brunsell and Michelle A. Fleming show you how to apply the joyful learning framework introduced in Engaging Minds in the Classroom to instruction in science and mathematics.\nAcknowledging that many students particularly girls and students of color do not see themselves as mathematicians and scientists, the authors provide a series of suggested activities that are aligned with standards and high expectations to engage and motivate all learners. Given the current focus on encouraging students to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies, this book is a welcome addition to every teacher s reference collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86e535043cd9c1c06ea797d02782acb310d40bbd","amp;dn":"Engaging+Minds+in+Science+and+Math+Classrooms+-+Opitz%2C+Michael+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86e535043cd9c1c06ea797d02782acb310d40bbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,229,53,4,60,217,193,192,110,167,151,208,39,130,172,179,16,212,11,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
