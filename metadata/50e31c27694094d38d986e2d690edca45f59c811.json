(&quot;1990&quot; in Roman numerals followed by an abbreviation of &quot;Anno Domini&quot;) is the first studio album\n from the electronic music group Enigma, headed by Michael Cretu. Recorded at A.R.T. Studios in Ibiza, it is one\n of the first albums to be recorded on a hard disk.\nReleased in 1990 on Virgin Records, the album reached number one in 41 countries[3] including the UK. It peaked at \nnumber 6 in the United States. The album spawned four singles: &quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot;, &quot;Principles of Lust&quot;, \n&quot;Mea Culpa (Part II)&quot; and &quot;The Rivers of Belief&quot;. &quot;Sadeness (Part 1)&quot; topped the UK singles charts and peaked in \nthe US at number 5.\nThe main theme in MCMXC a.D. could be interpreted as the struggle that one faces in life, between religion and sexuality.\n&quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot;, the main song of the album, questions the personal beliefs of the Marquis de Sade,\n who had an affection towards torture as pleasure. Other themes that appear on the album were based on\n Christian beliefs, and the end of the world from the Book of Revelation.\n\n========================================\n  \nTracklist\n\n1\tThe Voice of Enigma\t2:22\n2\tPrinciples of Lust: Sadeness / Find Love / Sadeness (reprise)\t11:44\n3\tCallas Went Away\t4:28\n4\tMea Culpa\t5:03\n5\tThe Voice &amp; The Snake\t1:40\n6\tKnocking on Forbidden Doors\t4:28\n7\tBack to the Rivers of Belief: Way to Eternity / Hallelujah / The Rivers of Belief\t10:32\n  \n=================================================\n\nGeneral[\n\nFile size                                : 859 MB\nAlbum                                    : MCMXC a.D.\nTrack name/Total                         : 7\nPerformer                                : Enigma\nGenre                                    : New Age, Ambient\nRecorded date                            : 1990\n\n=========================================================\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 3 041 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50e31c27694094d38d986e2d690edca45f59c811","amp;dn":"Enigma+-+MCMXC+a.D+%281990%29+Flac%5B24+Bit+96KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50e31c27694094d38d986e2d690edca45f59c811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,227,28,39,105,64,148,211,141,152,110,45,105,14,220,164,95,89,200,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
