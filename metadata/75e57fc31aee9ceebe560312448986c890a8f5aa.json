The band&amp;#039;s early hard-driving singles set a standard in the mid-1960s for Rock &amp; Roll, while albums such as Face to Face,[1] Something Else, Village Green, Arthur and Muswell Hillbillies are highly regarded by fans, critics, and peers alike, and are considered amongst the most influential recordings of the era.[2] In the United States, The Kinks are categorised as a British Invasion band, along with the other members of the so-called Big Four (The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who). Despite being less commercially successful than these three contemporaries, the band is frequently cited as one of the most important and influential rock bands of all time.\n\nThis album features the Kink&amp;#039;s greatest work.  It is a marvellous tribute to the instrumental and vocal vitality of the band and a salute to the exceptional writing skill of Ray Davies.  It is a definitive collection which captures the Kinks at their very best and showcases the versatillity of their output.\n\nReleased 1989 BMG.\n\nTrack Time Listeners \n1     Come Dancing  3:58  9,645  \n2     You Really Got Me  2:13  51,079  \n3     All Day and All of the Night  2:21  34,241  \n4     Tired of Waiting for You  2:30  21,107  \n5     Ev&amp;#039;rybody&amp;#039;s Gonna Be Happy  2:19  1,044  \n6     Set Me Free  2:12  17,070  \n7     Till the End of the Day  2:20  13,974  \n8     Dedicated Follower of Fashion  3:02  17,308  \n9     Sunny Afternoon  3:32  32,355  \n10   Dead End Street  3:21  15,332  \n11   Lola  4:08  47,806  \n12   Don&amp;#039;t Forget to Dance  4:40  3,994  \n13   Waterloo Sunset  3:17  33,546  \n14   Apeman  3:50  15,309  \n15   Well Respected Man  2:45  2,863  \n16   Death of a Clown  3:15  14,749  \n17   Suzannah&amp;#039;s Still Alive  2:25  1,029  \n18   Days  2:53  15,000  \n19   Victoria  3:39  19,024  \n20   Autumn Almanac  3:10  14,217\n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75e57fc31aee9ceebe560312448986c890a8f5aa","amp;dn":"The+Kinks+25+Years+%28The+Ultimate+Collection%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75e57fc31aee9ceebe560312448986c890a8f5aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,229,127,195,26,238,156,238,190,86,3,18,68,137,134,200,144,168,245,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
