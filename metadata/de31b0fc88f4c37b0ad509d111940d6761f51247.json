From Mrs. Doubtfire, Jumanji, and Aladdin to Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society, Robin Williams brought laughterÃ¢â‚¬â€and deep joyÃ¢â‚¬â€to a generation. He was sparklingly funny, a lightning-fast improviser, and a wonderful comic. But what touched millions of people was the warmth and compassion he exuded. The deeply tragic manner in which he took his own life has come as a shock to the world and caused people to wonder about the desperately troubled life behind the laughter he gave to millions. With Twitter igniting from record volumes of tributes to the much-loved actor, the death of Robin Williams has caused a public outpouring of grief not seen since the passing of Michael Jackson or Whitney Houston. Emily HerbertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sensitive and thoughtful biography celebrates his genius, and attempts to understand what could have driven such a warm and gifted man to take his own life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de31b0fc88f4c37b0ad509d111940d6761f51247","amp;dn":"Robin+Williams+-+When+the+Laughter+Stops+1951-2014+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de31b0fc88f4c37b0ad509d111940d6761f51247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,49,176,252,136,244,195,123,10,213,9,209,17,148,13,103,97,245,18,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
