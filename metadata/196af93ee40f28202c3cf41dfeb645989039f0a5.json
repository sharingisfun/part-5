Dalton clearly demonstrates how GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelong career in national politics gave him the opportunity to develop and refine his ideals. He then concludes with a comparison of GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methods and the strategies of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, drawing a fascinating juxtaposition that enriches the biography of all three figures and asserts GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relevance to the study of race and political leadership in America. Dalton situates Gandhi within the Ã¢â‚¬Å“clash of civilizationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ debate, identifying the implications of his work on continuing nonviolent protests. He also extensively reviews Gandhian studies and adds a detailed chronology of events in GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:196af93ee40f28202c3cf41dfeb645989039f0a5","amp;dn":"Mahatma+Gandhi+-+Non+Violent+Power+in+Action+-+Dennis+Dalton.epu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"196af93ee40f28202c3cf41dfeb645989039f0a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,106,249,62,228,15,40,32,44,60,244,29,254,182,69,152,144,57,240,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
