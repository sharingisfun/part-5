In this book Martin Crawford gives comprehensive advice on all types of perennial vegetables (edible plants that live longer than three years) including coppiced trees, aquatic plants and edible woodland species. There are many advantages to growing perennial vegetables, for example: they need less tillage than conventionally grown vegetables, so the soil structure is not distrubed in their cultivation and carbon is retailed int he soil. They extend the harvesting season, especially in early spring; they are often of more value to beneficial insects than are annual vegetables; many perennial vegetables contain higher levles of mineral nutrients than annuals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5d2a7f03f30ef5cb75cc751554b570cba3d6436","amp;dn":"How+to+Grow+Perennial+Vegetables+-+Low-maintenance%2C+Low-impact+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5d2a7f03f30ef5cb75cc751554b570cba3d6436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,210,167,240,63,48,239,92,183,92,199,81,85,75,87,12,186,61,100,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
