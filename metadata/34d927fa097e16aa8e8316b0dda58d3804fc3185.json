This is the story of how these two men Ã¢â‚¬â€œ separated in age by forty years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ discovered the existence of the electromagnetic field and devised a radically new theory which overturned the strictly mechanical view of the world that had prevailed since NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time.\n\nThe authors, veteran science writers with special expertise in physics and engineering, have created a lively narrative that interweaves rich biographical detail from each manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life with clear explanations of their scientific accomplishments. Faraday was an autodidact, who overcame class prejudice and a lack of mathematical training to become renowned for his acute powers of experimental observation, technological skills, and prodigious scientific imagination. James Clerk Maxwell was highly regarded as one of the most brilliant mathematical physicists of the age. He made an enormous number of advances in his own right. But when he translated FaradayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideas into mathematical language, thus creating field theory, this unified framework of electricity, magnetism and light became the basis for much of later, 20th-century physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34d927fa097e16aa8e8316b0dda58d3804fc3185","amp;dn":"Faraday%2C+Maxwell%2C+and+the+Electromagnetic+Field+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34d927fa097e16aa8e8316b0dda58d3804fc3185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,217,39,250,9,126,22,170,142,131,22,176,221,165,141,56,4,252,49,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
