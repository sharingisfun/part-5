Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got company.\n\nAtticusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apprentice Granuaile is at last a full Druid herself. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, Atticus has defrosted an archdruid long ago frozen in time, a father figure (of sorts) who now goes by the modern equivalent of his old Irish name: Owen Kennedy.\n\nAnd Owen has some catching up to do.\n\nAtticus takes pleasure in the role reversal, as the student is now the teacher. Between busting AtticusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chops and trying to fathom a cell phone, Owen must also learn English. For Atticus, the juryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still out on whether the wily old coot will be an asset in the epic battle with Norse god LokiÃ¢â‚¬â€or merely a pain in the arse.\n\nBut Atticus isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one with daddy issues. Granuaile faces a great challenge: to exorcise a sorcererÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spirit that is possessing her father in India. Even with the help of the witch Laksha, Granuaile may be facing a crushing defeat.\n\nAs the trio of Druids deals with pestilence-spreading demons, bacon-loving yeti, fierce flying foxes, and frenzied Fae, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hoping that this time . . . threeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a charm.\n\n\n\nFor a list of my other uploads: https://thepiratebay.se/user/Moia420\n\n\n\nHappy Listening","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4934b1375a7b58938f21c671d36c1613f088a3e2","amp;dn":"Kevin+Hearne+-+Iron+Druid+Chronicles+7+-+Shattered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4934b1375a7b58938f21c671d36c1613f088a3e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,52,177,55,90,123,88,147,143,33,198,113,211,108,22,19,240,136,163,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
