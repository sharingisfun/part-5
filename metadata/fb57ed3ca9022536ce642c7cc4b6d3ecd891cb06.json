Barnes (Tom Berenger), whose facial scars are a mirror of the violence and corruption\nof his soul, and Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe), who maintains a Zen-like calm in the jungle and fights with both \npersonal and moral courage even though he no longer believes in the war. After a few weeks &quot;in country,&quot; \nTaylor begins to see the naÃƒÂ¯vetÃƒÂ© of his views of the war, especially after a quick search for enemy troops devolves\ninto a round of murder and rape. Unlike Hollywood's first wave of Vietnam movies (including The Deer Hunter,\nApocalypse Now, and Coming Home), Platoon is a grunt's-eye view of the war, touching on moral issues but focusing on the men\nwho fought the battles and suffered the wounds. In this sense, it resembles older war movies more than its Vietnam peers,\nas it mixes familiar elements of onscreen battle with small realistic details: bugs, jungle rot, exhaustion, C-rations, \nmarijuana, and counting the days before you go home. This mix of traditional war movie elements with a contemporary sensibility\nwon Platoon four Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, and a reputation as one of the definitive modern war films.\n=================================================\n               Platoon (1986) Info\n{________________________________________________} &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/&lt;/a&gt;\nIMDB Ratings: 8,2/10 from 237.758 users  \nDrama: Drama | War   \nDirector: Oliver Stone\nStarring: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen\nWritten by: Oliver Stone\nRelease dates: December 19, (1986)\nLanguage: English\n=================================================\nSubtitles Info:\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _]\nPlatoon.(1986).English\nPlatoon.(1986).Portuguese\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps DVD PAL\nDuration: 01h:54mn:41Sec\n=================================================\nVideo Specifications:\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _]\nFormat/________________________________: AVI\nFormat/Info/___________________________: Audio Video Interleave\nFile size/_____________________________: 1.36 GiB\nDuration/______________________________: 1h 54mn\nOverall bit rate/______________________: 1 704 Kbps\nCodec ID/______________________________: XVID\nBit rate/______________________________: 1 246 Kbps\nWidth/_________________________________: 688 pixels\nHeight/________________________________: 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio/__________________: 1.85:1\nFrame rate/____________________________: 25.000 fps\n=================================================\nAudio Specifications:\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _]\nFormat/________________________________: AC-3\nFormat/Info/___________________________: Audio Coding 3\nDuration/______________________________: 1h 54mn\nBit rate mode/_________________________: Constant\nBit rate/______________________________: 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)/____________________________: 6 channels\nSampling rate/_________________________: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage/______________________________: English\n=================================================\nGreetz to all our friends from the past to present!!
