This collection of more than 500 photographs taken by amateurs and professional propagandists provides a panoramic overview of Nazi Germany, offering intimate glimpses into living rooms and killing grounds, kitchens and concentration camps, movie theaters and battle fronts. The explanatory text explores the cultural and historical context of the images, uniting them into a cohesive and riveting narrative. Together, these photographs, most never before seen, create a time capsule of indelible images that capture the faces of the individuals who fell under the sway of the swatstika as well as those who suffered under its onslaught on humanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31abc813bf6ec0934154477a080bf50d06c45d2f","amp;dn":"New+Images+of+Nazi+Germany%3A+A+Photographic+Collection+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31abc813bf6ec0934154477a080bf50d06c45d2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,171,200,19,191,110,192,147,65,84,71,122,8,11,245,13,6,196,93,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
