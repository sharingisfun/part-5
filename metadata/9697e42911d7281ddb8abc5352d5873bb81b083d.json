He achieved fame with his weird fiction which fixed horror, science fiction and fantasy to great effect. Despite his writing career being cut short by his death in WWI, his extensive body of work would go on to influence generations of writers.\n\nThese five volumes collect all of his published work - each volume starting with one of his novels and then including other stories that fit the general theme. They include an introduction and final notes on the texts and the last volume also presents the &quot;copyright versions&quot; and other alternate releases (plus two counterfeits) making the set about as comprehensive as it is possible to get.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9697e42911d7281ddb8abc5352d5873bb81b083d","amp;dn":"The+Collected+Fiction+of+William+Hope+Hodgson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9697e42911d7281ddb8abc5352d5873bb81b083d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,151,228,41,17,215,40,29,219,138,188,83,82,213,135,59,184,27,8,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
