Recognizing a once in a lifetime opportunity to make first contact, Alex pulls off a daring maneuver to latch on to the derelict.\n\nAlex discovers the ship was attacked by an unknown craft, the first of its kind ever encountered. The mysterious silver ship's attack was both instant and deadly.\n\nWhat enfolds is a story of the descendants of two Earth colony ships, with very different histories, meeting 700 years after their founding and uniting to defend humanity from the silver ships.\n\n\nRead by Grover Gardner\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75fcb1667dc600268319285cacbc6f6de2266be1","amp;dn":"S.H.+Jucha+-+The+Silver+Ships+%28Silver+Ships+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75fcb1667dc600268319285cacbc6f6de2266be1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,252,177,102,125,198,0,38,131,25,40,92,172,188,111,109,226,38,107,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
