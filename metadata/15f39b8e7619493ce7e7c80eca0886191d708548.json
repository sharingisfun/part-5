His troubles? He      \n dances around telling her that he loves her, and his idea of work is         \n illegal. He&amp;#039;s arrested, imprisoned, and she puts him behind her when she     \n realizes that even prison is just a good excuse for him to play football     \n with the guys. When he is paroled, it&amp;#039;s to a job in the &quot;hotel industry&quot; at  \n a board and care home for seniors, where the head nurse is running a scam.   \n Three of the residents respond to Wendell&amp;#039;s good heart. Can they expose the  \n scam and help Wendell win back Doreen?                                       \n                                                                              \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15f39b8e7619493ce7e7c80eca0886191d708548","amp;dn":"The+Wendell+Baker+Story.WS.2005.XviD.HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15f39b8e7619493ce7e7c80eca0886191d708548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,243,155,142,118,25,73,60,231,231,200,14,202,8,134,25,29,112,133,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
