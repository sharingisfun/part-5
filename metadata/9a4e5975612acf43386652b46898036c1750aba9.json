Here's how to do it. Step by step:\n (This guide is assuming that you have my [Mrberu's] v1.6 CSS for Mac Cider Port on your comp)\n\n1. Control click the Counter Strike app and press &quot;Show Contents&quot;\n2. Navigate to Contents&gt;Resources&gt;Transgaming&gt;c_drive&gt;program Files&gt;css&gt;cstrike&gt;cfg. (UPDATE: It used to say &quot;config&quot; here, the correct folder is cfg)\n3. delete the config.cfg file.\n4.copy paste the config_defaults.cfg into the folder.\n5.Rename the config_defaults.cfg to config.cfg\n6. Download the master server directory here: http://css.setti.info/code/masterserver/\nIMPORTANT: After downloading the Masterserver.vdf (or something like that, can't remember extension), highlight it and press command+i. Change the settings on it so that you can READ (it) ONLY. The game will update the servers with Valve's servers if you don't\n7. Go back to the css folder and go into platform&gt;config\n6. Rename you MasterServers file to something else so you know that it is the original.\n7. Add the new Master Servers file you downloaded from the web in it's place.\n8. Back track to Contents&gt;MacOS (we'll get back to here later.\n9. Open a new window, and navigate to Macintosh HS&gt;Library&gt;Preferences and delete the Counter Strike Preferences Preferences folder (note: you don't have to do this if you've never run the game.)\n10. Open the terminal from Applications&gt;Utilites\n11. Type &quot;touch&quot; in the terminal (without the &quot;s) followed by a space\n12. Drag the &quot;cider&quot; Unix Executable file from the MacOS folder (you should have that window open) into the terminal.\n13. Press enter.\n14. Run the app, or drag the Cider file into the terminal and press enter again.\n15. Rename yourself from the Multiplay settings.\n16. Click on find servers.\n17. Enjoy!\n\nREALLY IMPORTANT UPDATE!:\n\nAll right everyone, I found out WHY you're all getting the C++ error on Startup, and what you can do to avoid it.\nFirst things first. Your config file is A-ok. I mean the config.cfg file. Don't worry about it too much. (if you're applying the fix for the first time, still follow the instructions.)\nThe problem is with the Cider preferences. Every time you press &quot;Apply&quot; in the in-game settings it changes the preferences in such a way that they don't match Cider's preferences. This means you can keep playing the game, but after you quit, you can't start it. Until I find a permanent fix, here's what you do:\n1) Apply the fix.\n2) Play the game, change the settings to suit your needs.\n3) Quit the game and delete your Counter Strike Preferences Preferences folder\n4) &quot;Touch&quot; the cider unix executable.\nAfter doing this, you should never feel the need to mess with the settings again, and by not doing-so, you will never receive the C++ runtime error on startup.\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a4e5975612acf43386652b46898036c1750aba9","amp;dn":"Counter+Strike+Source+for+Mac+fix%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a4e5975612acf43386652b46898036c1750aba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,78,89,117,97,42,207,67,56,102,82,180,104,152,3,108,23,80,171,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
