Particularly well known for his work with Donna Summer during the era of disco (including &quot;I Feel Love&quot;), Moroder is the founder of the former Musicland Studios in Munich, which served as a recording home for artists ranging from Led Zeppelin and Queen to Elton John for much of the 1980s and 1990s. He also has his own record label the Oasis Records who later became a subdivision of Casablanca Records.\nOften collaborating with lyricist Bellotte, Moroder scored a number of hits in his own name including &quot;Son Of My Father&quot; in 1972 and &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; in 1977, and in the following year releasing &quot;Chase&quot; in 1978, the theme from the film Midnight Express.
