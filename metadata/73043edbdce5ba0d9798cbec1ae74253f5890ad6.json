Two of Wings' original members quit in a huff just before its production. The whimsical decision to record in Lagos, Nigeria, became a nightmare when McCartney and company found themselves in a decaying studio, then had many of the project's demos stolen by armed bandits. Despite these hardships--perhaps because of them--Band on the Run remains the most focused and consistently satisfying record of McCartney's wildly uneven post-Beatles career.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.Band on the run                                      [05:14]\n02.Jet                                                  [04:09]\n03.Bluebird                                             [03:25]\n04.Mrs. vandebilt                                       [04:42]\n05.Let me roll it                                       [04:50]\n06.Mamunia                                              [04:51]\n07.No words                                             [02:36]\n08.Picasso's last words (drink to me)                   [05:49]\n09.Nineteen hundred and eighty five                     [05:32]\n\n     CD2\n\n01.Helen wheels                                         [03:48]\n02.Country dreamer                                      [03:10]\n03.Bluebird (from one hand clapping)                    [03:29]\n(from one hand clapping)                         [03:58]\n05.Let me roll it (from one hand clapping)              [04:26]\n06.Band on the run (from one hand clapping)             [05:15]\n07.Nineteen hundred and eighty five                     [06:00]\n     (from one hand clapping)\n08.Country dreamer (from one hand clapping)             [02:17]\n09.Zoo gang                                             [02:01]\n____\n\n75:32 min\n105,9 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73043edbdce5ba0d9798cbec1ae74253f5890ad6","amp;dn":"Paul_Mccartney_And_Wings-Band_On_The_Run-2CD-%28Retail%29-1973-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73043edbdce5ba0d9798cbec1ae74253f5890ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,4,62,219,220,229,186,13,151,152,203,236,26,231,66,83,245,137,10,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
