Across the three garments, they will be looking for avant-garde cutting-edge designs and the trickiest pattern cutting ever seen on the Sewing Bee.\n\nThe formidable first challenge sees the sewers taking on a pattern as complex as origami - with no diagrams to help them. The brain-teasing instructions almost prove too much for one of the finalists.\n\nThe next challenge sees alterations so extraordinary they leave Patrick speechless, and finally they are asked to fit an avant-garde dress for a model they weren't expecting, before Claudia Winkleman announces the winner of this year's Great British Sewing Bee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fdd602b42246ee12fbcf0183e0bde082cf3ddfc","amp;dn":"The+Great+British+Sewing+Bee-S03E06--x264-SD-WebDL--STS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fdd602b42246ee12fbcf0183e0bde082cf3ddfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,221,96,43,66,36,110,225,47,188,240,24,62,11,222,8,44,243,221,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
