That said it is about twice as big as those versions, but it also contains audio commentaries when available* and the audio is untouched Dolby Surround (2 ch) in English (no subs). Image size is 1024x576 (anamorphic) and the average bitrate is 2100 kbps (probably overkill but I wanted Fred to look her best).\n\nLike I said, you'd have to be slightly obsessed :)\n\n* Audio commentaries:\nEpisode 1: Joss Whedon\nEpisode 8: Skip Schoolnik, David Fury, Steven S.
