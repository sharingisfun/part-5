But when Jon, in an effort to impress the Liz - the vet and an old high-school crush - adopts a dog named Odie and brings him home, Garfield gets the one thing he doesn't want. Competition. One night Odie runs away and gets dog-napped after Garfield locks him outside. Garfield, in an out of character move, goes to search for and rescue Odie with the help of a variety of animal friends along the way.\n\nWriting credits\n\nJim Davis (comic strip &quot;Garfield&quot;) Joel Cohen &amp; Alec Sokolow\t\n\nFormat : AVI at 1984 Kbps\nLength : 1 GiB for 1h 16mn 40s 900ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 1863 Kbps\nAspect : 704 x 400 (1.760) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos : 2 ÃŽÂºÃŽÂ±ÃŽÂ½ÃŽÂ¬ÃŽÂ»ÃŽÂ¹ÃŽÂ±, 48.0 KHz\n\n\nGarfield 2\n\nStoryline\nGarfield is back and this time Garfield and his canine sidekick Odie follows their owner, Jon Arbuckle, to England, the U.K. may never recover, as Garfield is mistaken for a look-alike, regal cat who has inherited a castle.

Jon Arbuckle was notably absent for an hour from the movie, and was only a cameo appearance character in the beginning, making Garfield's Fun Fest the movie to have the most smallest role of Jon Arbuckle. Almost every character, scenery, running gag, and background reappears in the movie, except the Reality World. It borrows the story plotline from Around The World In 80 Days and numerous parodies.\n\nDirectors: Mark A.Z.

As fortune would have it, Odie the dog happens to drop a bone into a hole in the screen separating the cartoon world from the real one, and Garfield sees the perfect opportunity. Jumping through the hole, the orange cat finds himself in the real word - and it's not exactly what he'd hoped. It's cold, lonely, and uncomfortable, and what's more, none of the other cats believe he's the real Garfield from the comic strips. Now our hero needs to find a way back into the comfort zone of his cartoon home, before the newspaper discontinues his comic strip for good. \n\nDirectors: Mark A.Z.
