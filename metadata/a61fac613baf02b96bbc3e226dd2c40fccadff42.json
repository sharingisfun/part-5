The show producers work with FBI special agents and examiners in high tech crime labs to portrait each case accurately. You will learn how the FBI protects the lives of Americans and brings the most notorious criminals to justice. The FBI was originally established to address crime that covered cities, counties, and spread across state lines. The country needed a federal law-enforcement entity to do those investigations. And over the years, as the country has grown and as the world, by the same token, has grown smaller, the FBIâ€™s mission has changed to meet the various threats. The show is hosted by James Kallstrom, the former director in charge of the FBI's New York office.\r\n\r\nEp 1 - Without Mercy\r\nEp 2 - Dead Run\r\nEp 3 - Brutal Abduction\r\nEp 4 - Radical Agenda\r\nEp 5 - The Killing Zone\r\nEp 6 - Deadly Takeover\r\nEp 7 - The Perfect Heist\r\nEp 8 - Brotherhood Of Hate\r\nEp 9 - Killer Instinct\r\nEp 10 - The Atlanta Prison Riot\r\nEp 11 - No Place To Hide\r\nEp 12 - A Bitter End\r\nEp 13 - Dangerous Gamble\r\nEp 14 - Dangerous Takedowns\r\nEp 15 - Inside The Bureau\r\nEp 16 - Radical Resistance\r\nEp 17 - Forced Entry\r\nEp 18 - Operation Goldenrod","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a61fac613baf02b96bbc3e226dd2c40fccadff42","amp;dn":"The+FBI+Files+-+Season+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a61fac613baf02b96bbc3e226dd2c40fccadff42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,31,172,97,59,175,2,185,107,188,62,34,109,210,196,15,204,173,255,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
