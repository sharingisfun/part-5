The challenges facing todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plant breeders have never been more overwhelming, yet the prospects to contribute significantly to global food security and farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ quality of life have never been more exciting and fulfilling. Despite this there has been a worrying decline in public funding for plant breeding-related research and support for international centers of germplasm development and crop improvement. In part, this has resulted in a serious reduction in the number of young people interested in devoting their professional careers to plant breeding as well as the number of universities offering plant breeding courses or conducting relevant research in plant breeding.\n\nThe authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aim in writing this book is to provide an integrated and updated view of the current scientific progress related to diverse plant breeding disciplines, within the context of applied breeding programs. This excellent new book will encourage a new generation of students to pursue careers related to plant breeding and will assist a wider audience of agricultural students, agronomists, policy makers and those with an interest in agriculture in gaining insight about the issues affecting plant breeding and its key role in improving the quality of life of people and in securing sufficient food, at the quality required and at an affordable price.\n\nWith comprehensive coverage including questions designed for students, and an accompanying website containing additional material to help in the study of the subject, Plant Breeding is an ideal text for all those studying plant and crop sciences, and a convenient reference source for professionals working in the area. All libraries within universities and research establishments where biological and agricultural sciences are studied and taught should have multiple copies of this book.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 295 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 2 edition (November 17, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470658304\nISBN-13: 978-0470658307\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888de5c0905e6b8ce718e6e1fca8083c44afa10d","amp;dn":"Plant+Breeding%2C+2nd+Edition+%282014%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888de5c0905e6b8ce718e6e1fca8083c44afa10d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,141,229,192,144,94,107,140,231,24,230,225,252,168,8,60,68,175,161,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
