Ten years after the incident, the leader of the group, Jinta Yadomi, has withdrawn from society and lives as a recluse. One summer day, the ghost of an older looking Menma appears before him and asks to have a wish granted, reasoning that she cannot pass on into the afterlife until it is fulfilled. Since Menma does not remember what her wish is, Jinta gathers his estranged friends together once again, believing that they are the key to resolving this problem. However, hidden feelings, internal conflicts, and lingering feelings of bitterness from Menma's parents result in complications for the group as they struggle to help not only Menma move on, but themselves as well.\n\n\n\nFile Size: 4.31GB\nFiles: 11\nResolution: 720p\nGenre: Slice of Life, Childhood Memories, Drama, Friendship, Romance\n\n\nFor more Anime Torrents visit:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5159a77c330e4494d095da89b954ed25996814cf","amp;dn":"Anohana+Complete+Eng+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5159a77c330e4494d095da89b954ed25996814cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,89,167,124,51,14,68,148,208,149,218,137,185,84,237,37,153,104,20,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
