But while Metasploit is used by security professionals everywhere, the tool can be hard to grasp for first-time users. Metasploit: The Penetration Tester\\'s Guide fills this gap by teaching you how to harness the Framework and interact with the vibrant community of Metasploit contributors.\n\nOnce you\\'ve built your foundation for penetration testing, you\\'ll learn the Framework\\'s conventions, interfaces, and module system as you launch simulated attacks. You\\'ll move on to advanced penetration testing techniques, including network reconnaissance and enumeration, client-side attacks, wireless attacks, and targeted social-engineering attacks.\n\nLearn how to:\n\n    Find and exploit unmaintained, misconfigured, and unpatched systems\n    Perform reconnaissance and find valuable information about your target\n    Bypass anti-virus technologies and circumvent security controls\n    Integrate Nmap, NeXpose, and Nessus with Metasploit to automate discovery\n    Use the Meterpreter shell to launch further attacks from inside the network\n    Harness standalone Metasploit utilities, third-party tools, and plug-ins\n    Learn how to write your own Meterpreter post exploitation modules and scripts\n\nYou\\'ll even touch on exploit discovery for zero-day research, write a fuzzer, port existing exploits into the Framework, and learn how to cover your tracks. Whether your goal is to secure your own networks or to put someone else\\'s to the test, Metasploit: The Penetration Tester\\'s Guide will take you there and beyond.\n\n\n\nPractical Packet Analysis: Using Wireshark to Solve Real-World Network Problems 2nd Edition\n===============================================================================\n\nBook Description\nISBN-10: 1593272669 | ISBN-13: 978-1593272661 | Publication Date: July 6, 2011 | Edition: Second Edition\n\nIt\\'s easy to capture packets with Wireshark, the world\\'s most popular network sniffer, whether off the wire or from the air. But how do you use those packets to understand what\\'s happening on your network?\n\nWith an expanded discussion of network protocols and 45 completely new scenarios, this extensively revised second edition of the best-selling Practical Packet Analysis will teach you how to make sense of your PCAP data. You\\'ll find new sections on troubleshooting slow networks and packet analysis for security to help you better understand how modern exploits and malware behave at the packet level. Add to this a thorough introduction to the TCP/IP network stack and you\\'re on your way to packet analysis proficiency.\n\nLearn how to:\n\n    Use packet analysis to identify and resolve common network problems like loss of connectivity, DNS issues, sluggish speeds, and malware infections\n    Build customized capture and display filters\n    Monitor your network in real-time and tap live network communications\n    Graph traffic patterns to visualize the data flowing across your network\n    Use advanced Wireshark features to understand confusing captures\n    Build statistics and reports to help you better explain technical network information to non-techies\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345ada8ed4ded4681936dc3cdfddd1b5746d07a7","amp;dn":"Cyberlympics+2011%2F12+Ebook+Prize+-+Metasploit+The+Penetration+Te","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345ada8ed4ded4681936dc3cdfddd1b5746d07a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,90,218,142,212,222,212,104,25,54,220,60,223,221,209,181,116,109,7,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
