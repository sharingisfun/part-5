[Reading A Man Without a Country is] like sitting down on the couch for a long chat with an old friend.â€ \r\nâ€“The New York Times Book Review\r\n\r\nIn a volume that is penetrating, introspective, incisive, and laugh-out-loud funny, one of the great men of letters of this ageâ€“or any ageâ€“holds forth on life, art, sex, politics, and the state of Americaâ€™s soul. From his coming of age in America, to his formative war experiences, to his life as an artist, this is Vonnegut doing what he does best: Being himself. Whimsically illustrated by the author, A Man Without a Country is intimate, tender, and brimming with the scope of Kurt Vonnegutâ€™s passions.\r\n\r\nâ€œFor all those who have lived with Vonnegut in their imaginations . . . this is what he is like in person.â€ \r\nâ€“USA Today\r\n\r\nâ€œFilled with [Vonnegutâ€™s] usual contradictory mix of joy and sorrow, hope and despair, humor and gravity.â€ \r\nâ€“Chicago Tribune\r\n\r\nâ€œFans will linger on every word . . . as once again [Vonnegut] captures the complexity of the human condition with stunning calligraphic simplicity.â€ \r\nâ€“The Australian\r\n\r\nâ€œThank God, Kurt Vonnegut has broken his promise that he will never write another book. In this wondrous assemblage of mini-memoirs, we discover his familyâ€™s legacy and his obstinate, unfashionable humanism.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f935bcdae27431cde012fa719cca5cb69bd2e0","amp;dn":"Kurt+Vonnegut+-+A+Man+Without+a+Country+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f935bcdae27431cde012fa719cca5cb69bd2e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,249,53,188,218,226,116,49,205,224,18,250,113,156,202,92,182,155,210,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
