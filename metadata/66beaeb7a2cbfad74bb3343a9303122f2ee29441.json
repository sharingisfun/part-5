In partnership with Bob Moog, we decided to reproduce the legendary interface with the same look and feel than the original because of its particular &quot;mood&quot;, and because many musicians wish to use the same interface they used in the past. But the reproduction of this synthesizer does not stop to the look and feel, we also recreated its inside characteristicsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nV2.5 NEW FEATURES:\n\nSupport for AAX (Pro Tools 11).\nSupport for 64-bit VST and Audio Unit (New in V2.5).\nSupport for Pro Tools 9 (New in V2.5).\nMIDI Control Assignment Improvement (New in V2.5).\nUpdate of toolbar look and feel (New in V2.5).\nAdded support for NRPN MIDI controls (New in V2.5).\nAdded triangle LFO waveform (New in V2.5).\nAll the parameters of the original minimoog V.\nAdvanced automation mode.\nRevolutionary preset navigation system called the SoundMap.\nNew formant-based FX called the Vocal Filter.\nNew modulation matrix with up to 6 connections (12 sources and 32 destinations).\nNew arpeggiator.\nNew LFO.\nNew Chorus and Stereo Delay Effect section.\nMore than 1000 presets created by talented artists and sound designers.\nUp to 32 voices of polyphony, and a Unison mode.\n3 voltage controlled oscillators with 5 waveforms.\n1 amazing sounding 24 dB/octave filter.\n1 VCA.\n1 Mixer.\n1 Noise Generator.\n2 ADSR envelopes.\n1 external audio input and 1 external oscillator and filter modulation input.\nSoft clipping function.\nNo aliasing from 0.1 Hz to 20 kHz.\n32-bit floating point precision.\nSampling rate: up to 96 kHz.\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n1.
