They are often cited as the first punk rock group. Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the punk rock movement in both the United States and, perhaps to a greater extent, in the United Kingdom.\n\nAll of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname &quot;Ramone&quot;, although none of them were related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years.[2] In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded.[3] Only a little more than eight years after the breakup, all three of the band's founding membersÃ¢â‚¬â€lead singer (and, at the time of founding, drummer) Joey Ramone, guitarist Johnny Ramone, and bassist Dee Dee RamoneÃ¢â‚¬â€had died.\n\nIt includes:\n-Acid Eaters\n-Adios Amigos\n-Animal Boy\n-Brain Drain\n-End Of The Century\n-Halfway To Sanity\n-Leave Home\n-Mondo Bizarro\n-Pleasant Dreams\n-Ramones\n-Road To Ruin\n-Rocket To Russia\n-Subterrean Jungle\n-Too Tough To Die\n\nAll the albums have their covers, the audio is in mp3 format, please leave your comment!\nSeed and enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bed7ed7f21646632dfc7202ee21b01a69157fe3","amp;dn":"The+Ramones+-+Studio+Discography+%5BTarcinTheUploader%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bed7ed7f21646632dfc7202ee21b01a69157fe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,237,126,215,242,22,70,99,45,252,114,2,238,33,176,26,105,21,127,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
