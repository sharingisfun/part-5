If you win from a ron with a closed hand, you get 10 minipoints (fu). Winning with a tsumo would be a yaku hand called...\n- Closed Tsumo (Menzen Tsumo): A hand where the winning player self-draws the winning tile and has not stolen any tiles from discards.\n- One-shot (Ippatsu): A hand where a riichi-declaring player wins during the next go-around after his/her Riichi declaration.\n- Dead Wall Tsumo (Rinshan Kaihou): Winning with the tile drawn from the dead wall after a kan.\n- All Simples (Tanyao): A hand with only suit tiles 2-8; no terminal (1, 9) or honor (winds, dragons) tiles are allowed.\n- Pure Double Chi (Iipeikou): A hand containing two identical chis.\n- Flat [Hand] (Pinfu): A hand that contains 4 chi melds and a pair that is not made up of dragons or the seat/round wind; the winning tile must also complete an open ended chi wait, such as x56x waiting for the 4 or 7.\n- Suji: A suit tile that is 3 away from an opponent's discarded tile. Suji are often safe to discard because the most common wait of importance is an open-ended Chi wait (i.e. have 5-6, waiting for 4 or 7) and the two tiles that would finish the Chi are 3 apart.\n- Suji Trap: A wait for a tile that looks safe to the opponents. This tile is 3 away from a previous discard, especially a 4, 5, or 6. Two classic examples are discarding the 6 from a 2-4-6 and waiting on the 3 or discarding a 6 from a 1-2-6 and waiting on the 3.\n- Red Fives (Red Dora): 4 suit tiles numbered 5 are inked in red. Each Red Five in a winning hand increases its value by 1 han. A tile may simultaneously be a Red Five and a Dora - 1 han is awarded for each bonus.\n- Pure Straight (Ikkitsukan/Ittsuu): A hand with 1 to 9 of the same suit.\n- Flush (Honitsu): A hand with just one suit plus honours.\n- Little Four Winds (Shousuushii): A hand with 3 sets of winds and a pair of the last wind.\n- Big Three Dragons (Daisangen): A hand with 3 sets of dragon tiles (Hatsu, Chun, Haku)\n- Seven Pairs (Chiitoitsu): A special hand made up of seven pairs of any combination instead of the usual four sets of three + one pair.\n- Toyone's playstyles are named after the lucky and unlucky days of Japanese calendar.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1536607b7170676274617067557c67763b677c6f7a7b3b7b7061&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://underwater.nyaatorrents.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://underwater.nyaatorrents.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;dbf89d9d9dabbebeaba89bb2a9b8f5a9b2a1b4b5f5b5beaf&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fffansubs.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fffansubs.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nSequel to the Saki series covering the Inter High School Mahjong Championships.\n\nRead more at http://myanimelist.net/anime/16123/Saki:_Zenkoku-hen#Ed8dtr0ThqQ4PfiZ.99\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8509b410365b3517121651ebe70406f2dbd4724","amp;dn":"Saki+Zenkoku-hen+-+The+Nationals+-+01-13+%28TV+720p%29+%5BBatch%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8509b410365b3517121651ebe70406f2dbd4724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,80,155,65,3,101,179,81,113,33,101,30,190,112,64,111,45,189,71,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
