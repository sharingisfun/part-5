In issue 27 of the series, Hank Pym made his debut as &quot;The Man in the Ant-Hill&quot;, what seemed to be just another one-shot horror story. However, soon Hank Pym would star in the series once more as Ant-Man, debuting as such in issue 35.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd5923412f010d68a184d2e6f23c85a26b851c0","amp;dn":"Tales+to+Astonish+v1+%28001+-+101%29+%281959+-+1968%29+%28Digital%2889%29+%26amp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd5923412f010d68a184d2e6f23c85a26b851c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,213,146,52,18,240,16,214,138,24,77,46,111,35,200,90,38,184,81,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
