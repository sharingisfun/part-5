CX2D 3 was\n        pred hours ago and 4 was delayed to having some tests run as its\n        first time being used.  Both CX2D 3 and CX2D 4 had updates done\n        to them and are two different applications.  Similar to this is\n        Ashampoo's updates to previous editions.  Surely people are going\n        to say the same as Burning Studio, that it's heading towards\n        bloatware and they will stick with CX2D 3.  Well we give you that\n        choice with continued updates to both editions, but don't expect\n        3 to recieve many more updates as 4 will be VSO's main focus now.\n\n\n        ConvertXtoDVD video converter, burn DVD\n\n        ConvertXtoDVD - top-choice video conversion software - convert\n        and burn any videos such as Avi to DVD, WMV to DVD, MKV to DVD,\n       ogm, mpeg, quicktime mov ! \n\n        This award-winning divx to dvd video converter software burn\n        video and audio formats to DVD, video conversion supports avi,\n        divx, wmv, mkv, xvid, vcd, vob, dvd... \n\n        All in one video conversion and burning software.\n\n\n        Backup and transfer your movies to DVD and enjoy watching them on\n        any home DVD player. \n\n\n        Key features: \n\n         Video formats supported: avi, divx, xvid, mov, mkv, flv, mpeg1,\n          mpeg2, mpeg-, nsv, dvr-ms, ts, ifo, vob, asf, wmv, realmedia,\n          rm, rmvb, ogm, existing files from digital camcorders, TV/Sat,\n          capture cards, etc. No external codecs needed like avi codec\n          download More formats...\n         Create DVD menus with different templates available,\n          possibility to add background video, image or audio, have\n          chapter and audio/subtitle menus\n         Conversion advisor wizard, control of the conversion speed vs.\n          quality\n         Fast and quality encoder, typically less than 1 hour for\n          converting 1 movie, and supports Multi-Core processors!\n         Included burning engine with burn speed control choice of SAO\n          or packet writing methods, supports all DVD formats\n         Custom and or automatic chapter creation with markers and\n          preview window\n         Advanced file merging possibilities\n         Audio formats supported internal and external: AC3, DTS, PCM,\n          OGG, MP3, WMA and more...
