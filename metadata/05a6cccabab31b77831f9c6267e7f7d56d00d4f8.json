In this tale revolving around not just parents and children but brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at the times that matter most. Following its characters and the ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the globeÃ¢â‚¬â€from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek island of TinosÃ¢â‚¬â€the story expands gradually outward, becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each turning page.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05a6cccabab31b77831f9c6267e7f7d56d00d4f8","amp;dn":"Khaled+Husseini+-+And+the+Mountains+Echoed+%28ePub+Fiction%29+%5Bsumof","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05a6cccabab31b77831f9c6267e7f7d56d00d4f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,166,204,202,186,179,27,119,131,31,156,98,103,231,247,213,109,0,212,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
