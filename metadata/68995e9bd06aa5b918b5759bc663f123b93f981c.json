While it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the same peaks and valleys, and the chorus wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t nearly as catchy, the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Up From Below,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was captivating and beautiful in a subdued way, sounding just as much of a prayer hymn as an indie rock song.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68995e9bd06aa5b918b5759bc663f123b93f981c","amp;dn":"Edward+Sharpe+and+the+Magnetic+Zeros+-+Here+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68995e9bd06aa5b918b5759bc663f123b93f981c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,153,94,155,208,106,165,185,24,181,117,155,198,99,241,35,185,63,152,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
