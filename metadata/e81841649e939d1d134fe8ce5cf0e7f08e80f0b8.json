He's tough, handsome and feared. However, when he witnesses a murder, he is put into the FBI's Witness Protection Program under the care of Agent Barney Coopersmith (Rick Moranis). Despite trying to hide his identity, Vinny can't help but stick his nose into trouble. This angers Barney as well as idealistic District Attorney Hannah Stubbs (Joan Cusack, cast to type once again), who clashes with Barney over how Vinnie's criminal offences should be handled.\n\n  Starring: Steve Martin, Rick Moranis, Joan Cusack, Melanie Mayron, Bill Irwin.\n\n  Directed by: Herbert Ross.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr. 35min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 600 x  450\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e81841649e939d1d134fe8ce5cf0e7f08e80f0b8","amp;dn":"My+Blue+Heaven+%281990%29+%28Steve+Martin%2C+Rick+Moranis%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e81841649e939d1d134fe8ce5cf0e7f08e80f0b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,24,65,100,158,147,157,29,19,79,232,206,92,240,231,240,142,128,240,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
