While many haiku collections are available to Western readers, few books combine both translated haiku with haiku written originally in English, along with an analysis of individual poems and of the haiku form itself. Written by a leading scholar in the field-Kenneth Yasuda was the first American to receive a doctorate in Japanese literature from Tokyo University-Japanese Haiku has been widely acclaimed. This edition is completely repackaged for 2002, and is the perfect book for lovers of poetry who do not have a solid background in haiku.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cb1bef50216ce537a521f378bc1032e7c26d4a4","amp;dn":"Japanese+Haiku+-+It%27s+Essential+Nature+and+History+%28Yasuda+Art+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cb1bef50216ce537a521f378bc1032e7c26d4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,177,190,245,2,22,206,83,122,82,31,55,139,193,3,46,124,38,212,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
