We connect with friends. We buy the\nlatest gadgets and gear. We find out what's happening in the world. But with\nthat same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each\nconnection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and\nmilestone, our every like and dislike. And it's not just people. Today, all\nmajor cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and\ncontrolled by complex operating systems.\n\n\nIn Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS)  and\nit controls almost every piece of the city's technology and holds key\ninformation on all of the city's residents.\n\n\nYou play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal\npast led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your\nfamily, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by\nmanipulating everything connected to the city's network. Access omnipresent\nsecurity cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control\ntraffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemyand more.\n\n\nUse the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of\nrevenge.\n\n===============================\nFeatures Repack'a: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Do not cut | Do not recoded \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Multi-language - MULTI2 Languages \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Game Version - v.1.03.471 \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Can download the required translations in the folder &quot;content&quot; (ru_text.bin - Russian | en_text.bin - English) \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ DLC Pack: \nÃ‚Â»The Palace Pack \nÃ‚Â»Signature Shot Pack \nÃ‚Â»Breakthrough Pack \nÃ‚Â»Exclusive Missions \nÃ‚Â»Untouchables Pack \nÃ‚Â»Cyberpunk Pack \nÃ‚Â»Dedsec Shadow Pack \nÃ‚Â»Blume Agent Pack \nÃ‚Â»Club Justive Pack \nÃ‚Â»R-33B gun \nÃ‚Â»MP-412 gun \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Installation time ~ 10-15 minutes. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ RePack by MAXAGENT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894d2178d2181b2e17a5841d1c13a7880687698f","amp;dn":"Watch+Dogs+Deluxe+Edition+v.1.03.471+%2B+11+DLC+RePack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894d2178d2181b2e17a5841d1c13a7880687698f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,77,33,120,210,24,27,46,23,165,132,29,28,19,167,136,6,135,105,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
