Though not a new literary construct, the weird western has recently gained momentum due to the megapopularity of fantasy and the reemergence of steampunk lit. As varied and wide as the open range, several of these eerie tales feature characters and locales steeped in both history and legend.\r\n\r\nIn Christie Yantâ€™s titular Dead Manâ€™s Hand, Wild Bill Hickok is resurrected; Johnny Appleseed makes an appearance in Orson Scott Cardâ€™s Alvin and the Apple Tree; and Monument Valley provides the backdrop for Fred Van Lenteâ€™s Neversleeps. While the landscape and the personalities may be familiar, each of these original stories is steeped in an appropriately eerie atmosphere, informing an alternative version of the American frontier.\r\n\r\nThe weird, wild west - an American frontier populated by gunslingers, rattlesnakes, outlaws, zombies, aliens, time travelers, and steampunk! Twenty-three of science fiction and fantasy's hottest and most popular authors create all-new tales, written exclusively for this anthology. Aliens and monsters, magic and science are introduced to the old west, with explosive results.\r\n\r\nStories in this collection:\r\n\r\n01) Introduction by John Joseph Adams\r\n02) The Red-Headed Dead by Joe R.
