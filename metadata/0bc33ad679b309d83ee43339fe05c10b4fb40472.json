Thoroughly revised and updated to keep pace with recent developments, it explains how relationship maps, cross-functional process maps (swimlane diagrams), and flowcharts can be used as a set to provide different views of work.\n\nNew in the Second Edition:\n\n* Four new chapters and 75 new graphics\n* An introduction to the concepts of flow and waste and how both appear in knowledge work or business processes\n* A set of measures for flow and waste\n* A discussion of problematic features of knowledge work and business processes that act as barriers to flow\n* Seven principles* and 29 guidelines for improving the flow of knowledge work\n* A detailed (actual) case study that shows how one organization applied the principles and guidelines to reduce lead time from an average of 28 days to 4 days\n\nUnlike &quot;tool books&quot; or &quot;pocket guides&quot; that focus on discrete tools in isolation, this text use a single comprehensive service work example that integrates all three maps, and illustrates the insights they provide when applied as a set. It contains how to procedures for creating each type of map, and includes clear-cut guidance for determining when each type of map is most appropriate. The well-rounded understanding provided in these pages will allow readers to effectively apply all three types of maps to make work visible at the organization, process, and job/performer levels.\n\n*The Seven principles are integrated into Version 3 of the body of knowledge used for Lean certification by the ASQ/AME/SME/SHINGO Lean Alliance. This is the first publication of those principles and guidelines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc33ad679b309d83ee43339fe05c10b4fb40472","amp;dn":"The+Basics+of+Process+Mapping%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc33ad679b309d83ee43339fe05c10b4fb40472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,195,58,214,121,179,9,216,62,228,51,57,254,5,193,11,79,180,4,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
