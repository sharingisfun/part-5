During his forty-year career at General Electric, he led the company to year-after-year success around the globe, in multiple markets, against brutal competition. His honest, be-the-best style of management became the gold standard in business, with his relentless focus on people, teamwork, and profits.\n\nSince Welch retired in 2001 as chairman and chief executive officer of GE, he has traveled the world, speaking to more than 250,000 people and answering their questions on dozens of wide-ranging topics.\n\nInspired by his audiences and their hunger for straightforward guidance, Welch has written both a philosophical and pragmatic book, which is destined to become the bible of business for generations to come. It clearly lays out the answers to the most difficult questions people face both on and off the job.\n\nWelch's objective is to speak to people at every level of an organization, in companies large and small. His audience is everyone from line workers to MBAs, from project managers to senior executives. His goal is to help everyone who has a passion for success.\n\nWelch begins Winning with an introductory section called &quot;Underneath It All,&quot; which describes his business philosophy. He explores the importance of values, candor, differentiation, and voice and dignity for all.\n\nThe core of Winning is devoted to the real &quot;stuff&quot; of work. This main part of the book is split into three sections. The first looks inside the company, from leadership to picking winners to making change happen. The second section looks outside, at the competition, with chapters on strategy, mergers, and Six Sigma, to name just three. The next section of the book is about managing your careerÃ¢â‚¬â€from finding the right job to achieving work-life balance.\n\nWelch's optimistic, no excuses, get-it-done mind-set is riveting. Packed with personal anecdotes and written in Jack's distinctive no b.s. voice, Winning offers deep insights, original thinking, and solutions to nuts-and-bolts problems that will change the way people think about work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4cb9fd1fe1b2e6a0393e2734c1b9d1a7aa0799","amp;dn":"Winning+-+Jack+Welch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de4cb9fd1fe1b2e6a0393e2734c1b9d1a7aa0799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,76,185,253,31,225,178,230,160,57,62,39,52,193,185,209,167,170,7,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
