Like so many Disney starlets, Cyrus needed to distance herself from her tween pop past; Can't Be Tamed tiptoed toward a more adult persona, but Bangerz kicks down the doors. This is her first non-Disney album, and in many ways it feels like a debut, an R&amp;B and hip-hop-tinged coming-out party that introduces Miley as an A-list pop star. Bangerz's guest list is packed with star producers, including Pharrell Williams and Mike Will Made-It, and vocalists like Britney Spears, who cameos on the fizzy &quot;SMS (Bangerz).&quot; Cyrus has taken cues from more established pop stars in the past -- Can't Be Tamed often evoked Ke$ha -- but one of the models for this album is clearly Rihanna. Miley's summer 2013 hit &quot;We Can't Stop&quot; was even originally offered to Rihanna, and they share a nasally buzz in their singing and a commitment to partying in their songs (if possible, &quot;Love Money Party&quot; sounds even more like a Rihanna-be than &quot;We Can't Stop&quot;). \n\n  Bangerz's take on R&amp;B is most convincing when it's balanced with Cyrus' country and pop roots, as on the Pharrell productions &quot;4x4,&quot; an improbable but entertaining piece of country-rap featuring Nelly, and &quot;#GETITRIGHT,&quot; which is so bouncy it almost sounds innocent despite Miley's insistence that she wants to be naughty. Cyrus and company also spend plenty of time sampling other early-2010s trends, whether it's the wobbly, dubstep-like synths on &quot;Drive&quot; or the EDM-leaning ballad &quot;Someone Else,&quot; but on every track, she sounds more mature than ever before. Despite its flashier moments, there are also plenty of ballads, something hinted at by the album's second single, &quot;Wrecking Ball.&quot; Bangerz even opens with a slow song (the unabashedly romantic &quot;Adore You&quot;), which in its own way is almost as bold a move as the publicity events that preceded the album's release. Brassy empowerment jams like &quot;Maybe You're Right,&quot; &quot;Do My Thang,&quot; and &quot;FU&quot; sell Cyrus as an independent woman, and the album accomplishes that mission: Bangerz transforms Miley into a pop star who won't -- and can't -- be ignored as she rings in her twenties.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:833d553d8eb9214214d860dcb60d7dd41d2d6705","amp;dn":"Miley+Cyrus+-+Bangerz+%28Deluxe%29+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"833d553d8eb9214214d860dcb60d7dd41d2d6705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,61,85,61,142,185,33,66,20,216,96,220,182,13,125,212,29,45,103,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
