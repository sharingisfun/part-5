More than a decade later, Ranel McCoy accused a Hatfield cousin of stealing one of his hogs, triggering years of violence and retribution, including a Romeo-and-Juliet interlude that eventually led to the death of one of McCoyâ€™s daughters. In a drunken brawl, three of McCoy's sons killed Devil Anse Hatfieldâ€™s younger brother. Exacting vigilante vengeance, a group of Hatfields tied them up and shot them dead. McCoy posses hijacked part of the Hatfield firing squad across state lines to stand trial, while those still free burned down Ranel McCoyâ€™s cabin and shot two of his children in a botched attempt to suppress the posses. Legal wrangling ensued until the US Supreme Court ruled that Kentucky could try the captured West Virginian Hatfields. Seven went to prison, and one, mentally disabled, yelled, â€œThe Hatfields made me do it!â€ as he was hanged. But the feud didnâ€™t end there. Its legend continues to have an enormous impact on the popular imagination and the region. \r\n\r\nWith a charming voice, a wonderfully dry sense of humor, and an abiding gift for spinning a yarn, bestselling author Lisa Alther makes an impartial, comprehensive, and compelling investigation of what happened, masterfully setting the feud in its historical and cultural contexts, digging deep into the many causes and explanations of the fighting, and revealing surprising alliances and entanglements. Here is a fascinating new look at the infamous Hatfield-McCoy feud","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:286162b1ce242c1f393aa663fc7193efd779f025","amp;dn":"Blood+Feud%3A+The+Hatfields+and+the+McCoys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"286162b1ce242c1f393aa663fc7193efd779f025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,97,98,177,206,36,44,31,57,58,166,99,252,113,147,239,215,121,240,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
