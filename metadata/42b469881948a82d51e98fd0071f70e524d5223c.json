An artist who in any other country would have been a one-hit wonder, in Jamaica became a household name having invented a whole new vocal style, sing-jay, flooding the airwaves with his catch phrases and going on to become a respected toaster. Eek-A-Mouse didn't start out as a novelty act. He was born Ripton Hilton in 1957 in Kingston, Jamaica, and his first foray into the music world was as a cultural roots singer.\n\nWhile barely out of his teens and still in college, Hilton released two singles in the mid-'70s, &quot;My Father's Land&quot; and &quot;Creation,&quot; to an apathetic public. Not discouraged, the young man continued plugging away, DJing for a variety of sound systems while also releasing occasional singles, all under his real name. To his friends, however, he was known as Eek-A-Mouse. A rather cruel jab, for that was the name of the losing racehorse Hilton kept throwing his money away on; of course as so often happens, the one time he declined to bet was the sole time the obstreperous equine won. The name stuck and by 1979, the singer decided a change was in order, and placed his musical fortune on this new moniker. That year, Eek-A-Mouse went into the studio with producer Joe Gibbs and walked out with the sizeable hit &quot;Once a Virgin.&quot; His follow-ups in 1980, &quot;Wa-Do-Dem&quot; and &quot;Modelling Queen,&quot; were equally successful, while the Bubble Up Yu Hip album, produced by Linval Thompson, proved that a growing share of Jamaicans were taken by the Mouse experience. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Anarexol\n02.Star, Daily News &amp; Gleaner\n03.Noah's Ark\n04.Terrorists In The City (12 Mix)\n05.Peeni Walli\n06.Wild Like A Tiger\n07.Wa-Do-Dem\n08.Do You Remember\n09.Sensee Party\n10.Stadium Hot\n11.Assassinator\n12.Christmas-A-Come\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b469881948a82d51e98fd0071f70e524d5223c","amp;dn":"Eek-A-Mouse+-+Very+Best+Of++%281987%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b469881948a82d51e98fd0071f70e524d5223c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,180,105,136,25,72,168,45,81,233,143,208,7,31,112,229,36,213,34,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
