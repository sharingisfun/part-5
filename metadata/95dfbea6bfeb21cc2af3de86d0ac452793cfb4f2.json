According to the official press release:\r\n\r\n    Three Men and a Baby is the new album by Mike and the Melvins. It was supposed to come out sixteen years ago.\r\n\r\n    These are the facts we can be sure of: in 1998, around the time his band godheadSilo went on hiatus, bassist/vocalist Mike Kunka busied himself by tagging along on a tour with his friends the Melvins. Somewhere along the way, Mike and the Melvins â€“ King Buzzo (guitar/bass/vocals), Dale Crover (drums/vocals), and Kevin Rutmanis (bass/vocals), at the time â€“ decided to make a record together, and gave the project the imaginative moniker Mike and the Melvins. Sub Pop, ever on the hunt for musicâ€™s Next Big Thing, enthusiastically agreed to fund and release the super-groupâ€™s debut, and recording commenced sometime in 1999.\r\nIt sat on a shelf from 1999 until 2015, when, much to everyoneâ€™s surprise, the involved parties reconvened, finished the damn thing, and delivered it to Sub Pop , where it was scheduled for the coveted April 1st, 2016 release date.
