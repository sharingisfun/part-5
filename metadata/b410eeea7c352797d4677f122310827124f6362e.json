Wolf's scientific background allows him to fully explain hormones, fats, and the digestive process, and helps him put the fundamentals of evolutionary biology into accessible context. He argues that, in addition to dietary changes, a focus on the quality and duration of sleep and a fitness routine is needed, and photographs accompanied by detailed instructions guide readers through simple exercises. Recognizing the time crunch of modern life, Wolf's program is created to require minimum time and expense. While a grain-free, dairy-free diet may sound difficult to implement, he suggests a commitment-light 30-day trial and provides a four-week menu with simple recipes like Slow Cooker Pork Loin, Chicken Alfredo, and Pizza with a nut-based crust. An extensive list of references, primarily from peer-reviewed journals, lends credence to an intriguing argument. \n\nI have nothing else to add, except, seed, and have a good life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b410eeea7c352797d4677f122310827124f6362e","amp;dn":"Paleodiet+-+Paleo+solution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b410eeea7c352797d4677f122310827124f6362e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,16,238,234,124,53,39,151,212,103,127,18,35,16,130,113,36,246,54,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
