(Dennis DeYoung confirmed this in an episode of In the Studio with Redbeard which devoted an entire episode to the making of the album.)\n\nThe album consists of four charted singles. &quot;The Best of Times&quot;, written by Dennis DeYoung, went to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot;, written by Tommy Shaw, went to #9 on the Billboard Hot 100, Shaw's only top 10 hit for Styx. &quot;Nothing Ever Goes as Planned&quot;, written by DeYoung, went to #54 on the US Pop Chart. &quot;Rockin' the Paradise&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ written by DeYoung, Shaw and James Young Ã¢â‚¬â€ went to #8 on the Top Rock Track Chart.\n\nThe song &quot;Snowblind&quot; (lyrics by Young, music by Young and DeYoung) was an attack on drug addiction. The track would come under fire for supposedly having backward messages and was branded by Tipper Gore's PMRC as &quot;Satanistic&quot;. James Young and DeYoung denied this on the In the Studio episode devoted to the making of Paradise Theatre.\n\nParadise Theatre became Styx's only US #1 album. It was the band's fourth consecutive triple-platinum album.Track listing\n\nSide 1:\n\n    &quot;A.D. 1928&quot; (Dennis DeYoung) - 1:08\n        Lead vocals: Dennis\n    &quot;Rockin' the Paradise&quot; (DeYoung, James Young, Tommy Shaw) - 3:35\n        Lead vocals: Dennis\n        Lead guitar: Tommy\n    &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; (Shaw) - 4:31\n        Lead vocals and lead guitar: Tommy\n    &quot;Nothing Ever Goes As Planned&quot; (DeYoung) - 4:48\n        Lead vocals: Dennis\n        Intro guitar solo: JY\n        Middle guitar solo: Tommy\n        Alto Saxophone solo: Steve Eisen\n    &quot;The Best of Times&quot; (DeYoung) - 4:19\n        Lead vocals: Dennis\n        Lead guitar: Tommy\n\nSide 2:\n\n    &quot;Lonely People&quot; (DeYoung) - 5:28\n        Lead vocals: Dennis\n        First guitar solo: Tommy\n        Second guitar solo: JY\n        Saxophone solo: Steve Eisen\n    &quot;She Cares&quot; (Shaw) - 4:17\n        Lead vocals and lead guitar: Tommy\n        Tenor Saxophone solo: Steve Eisen\n    &quot;Snowblind&quot; (Young, DeYoung) - 5:00\n        Lead vocals: JY and Tommy\n        Lead guitar: JY\n    &quot;Half-Penny, Two-Penny&quot; (Young, Ray Brandle) - 4:33\n        Lead vocals: JY\n        Lead guitar: Tommy\n    &quot;A.D. 1958&quot; (DeYoung) - 2:27\n        Lead vocals: Dennis\n        Lead guitar: JY\n        Saxophone solo: Steve Eisen\n    &quot;State Street Sadie&quot; (DeYoung) - 0:28\n        Piano: Dennis\n\nPersonnel\n\nStyx\n\n    Dennis DeYoung Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Keyboards, Vocals\n    Chuck Panozzo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\n    John Panozzo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums, Percussion\n    Tommy Shaw Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitars, Vocals, Vocoder\n    James Young Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar, Vocals\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n    Dan Barber - horn\n    Steve Eisen - saxophone\n    Mike Halpin - horn\n    John Haynor - horn\n    Mark Ohlson - horn\n    Billy Simpson - horn\n\nProduction\n\n    Producer: Styx (Dennis DeYoung)\n    Engineers: Rob Kingsland, Gary Loizzo\n    Arranger: Styx\n    Mastering: Ted Jensen\n\nCharts\n\nAlbum - Billboard (North America)\nYear \tChart \tPosition\n1981 \tPop Albums \t1\n\nSingles - Billboard (North America)\nYear \tSingle \tChart \tPosition\n1981 \t&quot;Nothing Ever Goes As Planned&quot; \tPop Singles \t54\n1981 \t&quot;Rockin' the Paradise&quot; \tMainstream Rock \t8\n1981 \t&quot;Snowblind&quot; \tMainstream Rock \t22\n1981 \t&quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; \tMainstream Rock \t2\n1981 \t&quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; \tPop Singles \t9\n1981 \t&quot;The Best of Times&quot; \tMainstream Rock \t16\n1981 \t&quot;The Best of Times&quot; \tPop Singles \t3\n\nThe album has sold 3 million copies up to date.
