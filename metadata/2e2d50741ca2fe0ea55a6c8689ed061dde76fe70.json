Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Nick Fisher examine the ecological and moral issues of fishing, teach individual skills such as catching and descaling, and offer a comprehensive (and fascinating) species reference section. They also demystify the cooking of fish with 135 recipes for preparing fish and shellfish in diverse ways, from pickling to frying to smoking. \n \nThis ambitious reference-cookbook appeals to both intellect and appetite by focusing on the pleasures of catching, cooking, and eating fish while grounding those actions in a philosophy and practice of sustainability. The authors help us understand the human impact on the seafood population, while their infectious enthusiasm for all manner of fish and shellfishÃ¢â‚¬â€from the mighty salmon to the humble mackerel to the unsung cockleÃ¢â‚¬â€inspires us to explore different and unfamiliar species. Fish is superlative food, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a precious resource. The River Cottage Fish Book delivers a complete education alongside a wealth of recipes, and is the most opinionated and passionate fish book around.\n\n\nBy Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Nick Fisher\nPublished by Ten Speed Press in 2012\nEPUB, Retail, 608 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e2d50741ca2fe0ea55a6c8689ed061dde76fe70","amp;dn":"The+River+Cottage+Fish+Book%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e2d50741ca2fe0ea55a6c8689ed061dde76fe70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,45,80,116,28,162,254,14,165,90,108,134,137,237,6,29,222,118,254,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
