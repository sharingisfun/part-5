In the original preface, Dr. Beck indicated that the book was an Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬Ëœideal portable referenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ for nurses, students, and residents; time has proven this to be correct.\n\nOrganizational aspects of the book include a brief outline at the outset of each chapter and a list of classic references at the end. Tables are succinct and uniformly helpful, as are the illustrations. Although the order of chapters is exactly the same, nearly every one has been rewritten by Dr. Beck, with updating of information to incorporate new advances where appropriate. Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬ËœRounds Questions,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a list of often-asked questions that highlight the essential teaching points of each topic, have been continued and expanded in the new edition.\n\nOther unique aspects of this book, in addition to its format, include its size and cost. It is indeed portable and affordableÃ¢â‚¬â€in contrast to the usual comprehensive volumes most often encountered on colorectal topics. The book is intended to be not so much a reference book as a basic useful guide to the care of patients that will be used repeatedly in daily practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b1f4aa6c229e813b785b9ec7696d9fb5791c8b4","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Colorectal+Surgery%2C+2E-+Beck+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b1f4aa6c229e813b785b9ec7696d9fb5791c8b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,31,74,166,194,41,232,19,183,133,185,236,118,150,217,251,87,145,200,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
