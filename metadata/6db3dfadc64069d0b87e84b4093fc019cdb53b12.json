It is the first full-length studio album since the band's 2012 release, Handwritten, and marks their first album on Island Records, which absorbed the band and its previous label, Mercury Records.\n\nProduced by Mike Crossey and inspired by vocalist and guitarist Brian Fallon's divorce from his wife of ten years, the band was influenced by artists whose albums represented &quot;career shifts&quot;.\n\nMetacritic \t58/100\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nClash \t7/10 stars\nNJ.com \tPositive \nDIY Magazine \t3/5 stars\nAbsolute Punk \t8.5/10 stars\nSlant Magazine \t1.5/5 stars\nSputnikmusic \t3.3/5\nThe Guardian \t2/5 stars\n\nGet Hurt has received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, they assign a &quot;weighted average&quot; rating out of 100 to selected independent ratings and reviews from mainstream critics, and the album has received an Metascore of a 58, based on 7 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.\n\nWriting for Absolute Punk, Craig Manning states: &quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disheartening that the album isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the game-changing record Fallon promised, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too bad that it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the thesis-statement cohesion of albums like The 59 Sound and American Slang. But the songs are still great, the production is still excellent, and the performances of the band members have rarely been in finer form.&quot;[22] Clash magazine's Mischa Pearlman rated the album seven out of ten, calling it &quot;rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll of the purest kind.&quot; Tim Jonze of The Guardian gave the album two stars out of five and writes &quot;Get Hurt is nothing but the same old overblown rock sound with every dial turned up several digits past 11.&quot;\n1. \t&quot;Stay Vicious&quot;   \t3:33\n2. \t&quot;1,000 Years&quot;   \t3:38\n3. \t&quot;Get Hurt&quot;   \t3:43\n4. \t&quot;Stray Paper&quot;   \t2:48\n5. \t&quot;Helter Skeleton&quot;   \t3:13\n6. \t&quot;Underneath the Ground&quot;   \t4:05\n7. \t&quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot;   \t2:50\n8. \t&quot;Red Violins&quot;   \t3:20\n9. \t&quot;Selected Poems&quot;   \t2:53\n10. \t&quot;Ain't That a Shame&quot;   \t3:02\n11. \t&quot;Break Your Heart&quot;   \t4:20\n12. \t&quot;Dark Places&quot;   \t3:44\nTotal length:\n\t41:15 \t\nDeluxe Edition Bonus TracksNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n13. \t&quot;Sweet Morphine&quot;   \t4:17\n14. \t&quot;Mama's Boys&quot;   \t4:01\n15. \t&quot;Halloween&quot;   \t3:11\nWell Not heavy enough for me but than its you who decide not me......seed.....seed....seed.....................................","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db3dfadc64069d0b87e84b4093fc019cdb53b12","amp;dn":"The+Gaslight+Anthem-Get+Hurt%28Deluxe+Edition%29+MP3+320k++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db3dfadc64069d0b87e84b4093fc019cdb53b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,179,223,173,198,64,105,208,184,126,132,180,9,63,192,25,205,181,59,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
