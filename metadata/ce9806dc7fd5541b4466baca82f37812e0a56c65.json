He is heard playing two duets with Billy Strayhorn, taking rare piano solos in 1932, 1941 and 1967, meeting up with Earl Hines in 1965 and leading a trio in 1945. However the real reason to acquire this set are the four duets (plus five alternate takes) with Jimmy Blanton, the first important bass soloist in jazz history. From 1940, those recordings find Blanton sounding like the Charles Mingus of 20 years later and Ellington unselfishly but masterfully playing the role of an accompanist. \n\n[b] Tracklist[/b]\n\t\n[b]The Ellington-Strayhorn Duets[/b]\n\n1 \tTonk \t\n2 \tDrawing Room Blues \t\n\t-\n\t[b]The Trios[/b]\n\n3 \tFrankie And Johnny \t\n4 \tJumpin' Room Only \t\n\t-\n[b]\tThe Solos[/b]\n\n5 \tLots O' Fingers \t\n6 \tDear Old Southland (Take 1) \t\n7 \tSolitude (Take 1) \t\n8 \tSolitude (Take 2) \t\n9 \tLotus Blossom \t\n\t-\n[b]\tThe Ellington-Blanton Duets[/b]\n\n10 \tPitter Panther Patter (Take 1) \t\n11 \tPitter Panther Patter (Take 2) \t\n12 \tBody And Soul (Take 1) \t\n13 \tBody And Soul (Take 2) \t\n14 \tBody And Soul (Take 3) \t\n15 \tSophisticated Lady (Take 1) \t\n16 \tSophisticated Lady (Take 2) \t\n17 \tMr. J.
