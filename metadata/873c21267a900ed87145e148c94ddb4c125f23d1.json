Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jumping about in the office like a lunatic to some AC/DC or driving with the windows down doing my best Steven Tyler vocal for every unsuspecting pedestrian, sometimes the occasion damn well calls for it! And letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face it, without bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like these there wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be half of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s we know and love today. And so when I came across LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Temperance Movement I had the urge all over again as this hugely-talented five-piece wield the kind of brilliant and bluesy rock n roll thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about as raw and honest as it gets. The band are following up their 2012 EP, Pride with their debut full-length which is released this week and it boasts 12 tracks (five of which actually make up Pride) that are minus any tricks up sleeves or reliant on any fancy production wizardry - just taking rock back to its bare roots.\n\n\n\nThis back-to-basics outfit are made up of Glasgow-born vocalist Phil Campbell, guitaristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Paul Sayer and Luke Potashnick, bassist Nick Fyffe and drummer from Down Under, Damon Wilson. Together theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a class act that represent what rock n roll used to be about; right from the off warming the soul with the rich and classic sound of Ã¢â‚¬ËœOnly FriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœPrideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The first is a sexy, slow number with a dirty strut that immediately brought to mind British blues-rock proÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Free. Campbell proves he is an absolute natural with his croaky, southern-like drawl adding heaps of character to the track. And the latter is a contrasting ballad of sorts with a beautifully laid-back structure of mellow guitars, soft rhythms and swirly melodies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873c21267a900ed87145e148c94ddb4c125f23d1","amp;dn":"The+Temperance+Movement+-+The+Temperance+Movement+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873c21267a900ed87145e148c94ddb4c125f23d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,60,33,38,122,144,14,216,113,69,225,72,201,77,219,76,18,95,35,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
