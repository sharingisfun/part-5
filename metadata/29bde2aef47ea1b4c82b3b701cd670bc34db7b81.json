As he tries to prove his cousin's innocence in a town where everyone seems to be on the take, Cross unearths a family secret that forces him to question everything he's ever known.\r\n\r\nChasing a ghost he believed was long dead, Cross gets pulled into a case that has local cops scratching their heads and needing his help: a grisly string of socialite murders. Now he's hot on the trail of both a brutal killer, and the truth about his own past--and the answers he finds might be fatal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29bde2aef47ea1b4c82b3b701cd670bc34db7b81","amp;dn":"Cross+Justice+%28Alex+Cross+%2323%29+-+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29bde2aef47ea1b4c82b3b701cd670bc34db7b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,189,226,174,244,126,161,180,200,43,59,112,28,214,112,188,52,219,123,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
