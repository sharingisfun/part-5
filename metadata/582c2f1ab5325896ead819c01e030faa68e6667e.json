All through the marvel of the phonograph. Surprisingly the man who created the phonograph, Thomas Alva Edison, had no theoretical background in acoustics, and only a few months of formal schooling. And ironically, he was half deaf. \r\nThomas Edison was not the first to record sound, but his competition with Alexander Graham Bell and other inventors led to the phonograph that created thousands of new jobs and gave birth to the music recording industry. First radio and then electronic recording contributed to the eventual decline in the phonograph's popularity.\r\nWith more than 1,000 patents to his credit, Thomas Alva Edison was perhaps the greatest inventor in history. But his favorite creation--the one he always called &quot;my baby&quot;--was one of his first: the phonograph. How did a man with so little schooling and no background in acoustics invent a way to turn vibrations into a replayable recording? This extraordinary program follows Edison on his great journey of discovery, from the early tinkerings with telegraphy and his first recording (&quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;) to his triumphant demonstrations at the White House. New information and rare photographs introduce Edison's chief rivals, including the famed inventor Alexander Graham Bell, and reveal how Edison's team approach outfoxed the competition.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/86/The-Phonograph-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/The-Phonograph-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9c/The-Phonograph-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/The-Phonograph-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/The-Phonograph-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/The-Phonograph-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/The-Phonograph-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/The-Phonograph-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/The-Phonograph-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/The-Phonograph-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/The-Phonograph-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/The-Phonograph-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/31/The-Phonograph-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/The-Phonograph-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/The-Phonograph-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/The-Phonograph-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\r\nVideo Bitrate: 2161 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 704x536\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.313:1\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 43:58.796\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 744 MB\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nEncoded by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Phonograph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:582c2f1ab5325896ead819c01e030faa68e6667e","amp;dn":"HC+Modern+Marvels+The+Phonograph+PDTV+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"582c2f1ab5325896ead819c01e030faa68e6667e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,44,47,26,181,50,88,150,234,216,25,192,30,3,15,170,104,230,102,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
