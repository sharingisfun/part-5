More and more, success is won by creating compelling stories that have the power to move partners, shareholders, customers, and employees to action.  Simply put, if you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell it, you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sell it.  And this book tells you how to do both.\n \nHistorically, stories have always been igniters of action, moving people to do things.  But only recently has it become clear that purposeful stories--those created with a specific mission in mind--are absolutely essential in persuading others to support a vision, dream or cause.\n             \nPeter Guber, whose executive and entrepreneurial accomplishments have made him a success in multiple industries, has long relied on purposeful story telling to motivate, win over, shape, engage and sell.  Indeed, what began as knack for telling stories as an entertainment industry executive has, through years of perspiration and inspiration, evolved into a set of principles that anyone can use to achieve their goals.\n            \nIn Tell to Win, Guber shows how to move beyond soulless Power Point slides, facts, and figures to create purposeful stories that can serve as powerful calls to action.  Among his techniques: \n  \n \n[b] \n*Capture your audienceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention first, fast and foremost\n \n*Motivate your listeners by demonstrating authenticity\n \n*Build your tell around Ã¢â‚¬Å“whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in it for themÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \n*Change passive listeners into active participants\n \n*Use Ã¢â‚¬Å“state-of-the-heartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ technology online and offline to make sure audience commitment remains strong\n \n [/b]           \nTo validate the power of telling purposeful stories, Guber includes in this book a remarkably diverse number of Ã¢â‚¬Å“voicesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½--master tellers with whom heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shared experiences.  They include YouTube founder Chad Hurley, NBA champion Pat Riley, clothing designer Normal Kamali, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mission to MarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ scientist Gentry Lee, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, former South African president Nelson Mandela, magician David Copperfield, film director Steven Spielberg, novelist Nora Roberts, rock legend Gene Simmons, and physician and author Deepak Chopra. \n             \nAfter listening to this extraordinary mix of voices, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know how to craft, deliver--and own--a story that is truly compelling, one capable of turning others into viral advocates for your goal. \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f41bba26815188d8d0d86cee44581c5fe28c5473","amp;dn":"Tell+to+Win+-+Connect%2C+Persuade+and+Triumph+-+Peter+Guber+%28PDF%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f41bba26815188d8d0d86cee44581c5fe28c5473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,27,186,38,129,81,136,216,208,216,108,238,68,88,28,95,226,140,84,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
