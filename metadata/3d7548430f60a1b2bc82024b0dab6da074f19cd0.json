They explain that the aging of the human body, just like the aging of man-made machines, results from an accumulation of various types of damage.  As with man-made machines, this damage can periodically be repaired, leading to indefinite extension of the machineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fully functional lifetime, just as is routinely done with classic cars.  We already know what types of damage accumulate in the human body, and we are moving rapidly toward the comprehensive development of technologies to remove that -damage.  By demystifying aging and its postponement for the nonspecialist reader, de Grey and Rae systematically dismantle the fatalist presumption that aging will forever defeat the efforts of medical science.&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sens.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sens.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d7548430f60a1b2bc82024b0dab6da074f19cd0","amp;dn":"Aubrey+de+Grey+-+Ending+Aging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d7548430f60a1b2bc82024b0dab6da074f19cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,117,72,67,15,96,161,178,188,130,2,75,13,171,109,160,116,241,156,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
