The Bard's pretty sarcastic by nature, but you get to decide just how scathing he is by selecting 'Nice' or 'Sarky' responses. Watch out you don't get too cocky though; folk you've upset may come back to haunt you.\n\nDuring his raucous adventures, the Bard recruits a motley band of eccentrics and misfits to help in his ignoble cause. Enemies can be defeated using traditional or magical weapons and you can also use the Bard's dulcet tones to summon creatures. If you're tired of saving humankind or bored of games that take themselves a bit too seriously, The Bard's Tale could very well be for you.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The BardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tale is easily the funniest game IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever played, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve played all the funny games out there.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ IGN\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ready your weapon and bladder as you embark on this ridiculously addicting quest and the funniest adventure of the year, The BardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Game Chronicles\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This game is satire in its sharpest formÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cheat Code Central\n\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: TEEN with Blood, Language, Suggestive Themes, Use of Alcohol, Violence.
