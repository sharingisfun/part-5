Stein and guitarist Ray Mensh. The band broke up in 1991 after two demos and two albums . Exumer appeared for a one-off show at Wacken Open Air in 2001 and were re-activated by V. Stein and Mensh in 2008.\n\nThe first album, Possessed by Fire, moves on the same line of Into the Dark Past of the then label mates of Angel Dust, the second album Rising from the Sea is rather more obvious the influence of Slayer thanks to the voice of Paul Arakaki, similar to that of Tom Araya. Soon after this album the band broke up only to reform in the 2001 during the exhibition at Wacken Open Air. In 2009 Exumer released a one track demo called Waking The Fire. Exumer have released their third album Fire &amp; Damnation in April 2012.\n\nYear: 1985 - 2012\nCountry: Germany, Frankfurt\nGenre: Thrash Metal\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 192 - 320Kbps\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n1985 - A Mortal in Black (Demo)\n1986 - Possessed By Fire\n1987 - Rising from the Sea\n1989 - Whips &amp; Chains (Demo)\n2009 - Waking the Fire (Single) [Demo]\n2012 - Fire &amp; Damnation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e9fd8094da1a71a03c306db3f21dc19fdf08919","amp;dn":"Exumer+-+Discography+%5BMetal%5D+%281985+-+2012%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e9fd8094da1a71a03c306db3f21dc19fdf08919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,159,216,9,77,161,167,26,3,195,6,219,63,33,220,25,253,240,137,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
