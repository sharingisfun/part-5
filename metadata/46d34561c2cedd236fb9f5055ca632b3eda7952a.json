This book provides an introduction to the theory of positive psychology and a practical guide on how to implement the theory in (primarily secondary) schools. The American psychologist and writer Martin Seligman, well known for his work on the idea of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlearned helplessness', has more recently been working in the field of positive psychology.
