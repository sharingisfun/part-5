It is named after the local name of the game Monopoly.\n\nThe series is one of the most well-known and popular examples of Danish television produced by the state run channel DR.\n\nThe series has become part of the modern self-understanding of Danes, partly because of its successful mix of drama and a distinct warm Danish humour in the depiction of characters, which was portrayed by a wide range of the most popular Danish actors at the time; but also not least because of its accurate portrayal of Denmark from the end of the roaring 1920s and through Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark in World War II. \n\nThe series is set in the fictional Danish town of KorsbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦k between 1929 and 1947. The story follows the life of various characters from high and low of town society, but is primarily focused around the rivalry between the families of - respectively - banker Hans Christian VarnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦s, one of the town's most prominent citizens, and newcoming businessman Mads (Andersen-)Skjern, who arrives in town in 1929.\n\n\n\nAll 24 episodes + extra material ripped from DVD to AVI in 640*480 at 128 kbps\n\nEnglish subtitles included as .srt files \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146db9faab021e99cd9500c073cd4f4f085b7766","amp;dn":"Matador+-+Danish+TV+show+%5B1-24+%2B+Extras+DVD+rip%5D+%2B+ENG+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146db9faab021e99cd9500c073cd4f4f085b7766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,109,185,250,171,2,30,153,205,149,0,192,115,205,79,79,8,91,119,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
