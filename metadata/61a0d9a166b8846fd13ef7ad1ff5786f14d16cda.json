His early poetry, published before his diplomatic career began in earnest, includes Ã‰LOGES (1911), which shows the influence of Symbolism.  The language of his verse, admired especially by poets for its precision and purity, is difficult, and he made little appeal to the general public; his hypnotic vision is conveyed by a liturgical metre and exotic words.  The best-known early work is the long poem &quot;Anabasis&quot; (1924), translated by T.S. Eliot.  In the poems written in exile, he achieved a deeply personal note.\r\n\r\nThe COLLECTED POEMS (1983) includes the posthumous &quot;Song for an Equinox&quot;, to form a complete edition of his poetic oeuvre, including also the 1960 Nobel speech &quot;On Poetry&quot; and his 1965 essay on Dante.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF format:\r\n\r\n* Collected Poems (Princeton UP, 1983).  Bilingual edition.  Various translators.\r\n\r\n* EÌloges &amp; Other Poems (Pantheon, 1965).  Bilingual edition.  Translated by Louise VarÃ©se.\r\n\r\n* Nobel Prize Banquet Speech (Nobel Foundation, 1967).\r\n\r\n* Seamarks (Harper &amp; Bros., 1961).  Bilingual edition.  Translated by Wallace Fowlie.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT ME: You can reach me with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc., at TPB's forum, SuprBay (you will need to register an account):  \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee  \r\n\r\nPLEASE HELP TO SEED!
