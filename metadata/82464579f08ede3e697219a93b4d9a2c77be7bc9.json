After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.\n\nNow, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be CassieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only hope for rescuing her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â€or even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82464579f08ede3e697219a93b4d9a2c77be7bc9","amp;dn":"The+5th+Wave+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82464579f08ede3e697219a93b4d9a2c77be7bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,70,69,121,240,142,222,62,105,114,25,169,59,77,154,44,119,190,123,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
