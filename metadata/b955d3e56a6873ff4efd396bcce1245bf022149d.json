Those who genuinely reason, like his protagonists, gamble with sanity. Lovecraft has developed a cult following for his Cthulhu Mythos, a series of loosely interconnected fiction featuring a pantheon of human-nullifying entities, as well as the Necronomicon, a fictional grimoire of magical rites and forbidden lore. His works were deeply pessimistic and cynical, challenging the values of the Enlightenment, Romanticism, and Christian humanism. Lovecraft's protagonists usually achieve the mirror-opposite of traditional gnosis and mysticism by momentarily glimpsing the horror of ultimate reality.\n\n(N.B. this new edition has corrected the formatting issues that has been voiced by some Lovecraft fans...)\n\nCONTENTS:\n\nThe Nameless City\nThe Festival\nThe Colour out of Space\nThe Call of Cthulhu\nThe Dunwich Horror\nThe Whisperer in Darkness\nDreams in the Witch-house\nThe Haunter of the Dark\nThe Shadow over Innsmouth\nThe Shadow out of Time\nAt the Mountain of Madness\nThe Case of Charles Dexter Ward\nAzathoth\nBeyond the Wall of Sleep\nCelephais\nCool Air\nDagon\nEx Oblivione\nFacts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family\nFrom Beyond\nHe\nHerbert West: Reanimator\nHypnos\nImprisoned with the Pharaohs\nIn the Vault\nMedusa's Coil\nMemory\nNyarlathotep\nPickman's Model\nPoetry of the Gods\nThe Alchemist\nThe Beast in the Cave\nThe Book\nThe Cats of Ulthar\nThe Crawling Chaos\nThe Descendant\nThe Doom That Came to Sarnath\nThe Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\nThe Evil Clergyman\nThe Horror at Martin's Beach\nThe Horror at Red Hook\nThe Hound\nThe Lurking Fear\nThe Moon Bog\nThe Music of Erich Zann\nThe Other Gods\nThe Outsider\nThe Picture in the House\nThe Quest of Iranon\nThe Rats in the Walls\nThe Shunned House\nThe Silver Key\nThe Statement of Randolph Carter\nThe Strange High House in the Mist\nThe Street\nThe Temple\nThe Terrible Old Man\nThe Thing on the Doorstep\nThe Tomb\nThe Transition of Juan Romero\nThe Tree\nThe Unnamable\nThe White Ship\nThrough the Gates of the Silver Key\nWhat the Moon Brings\nPolaris\nThe Very Old Folk\n\nepub, mobi and txt.\n\nplease rep me +1 if you enjoy my uploads.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b955d3e56a6873ff4efd396bcce1245bf022149d","amp;dn":"The+Complete+H.+P.+Lovecraft++Reader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b955d3e56a6873ff4efd396bcce1245bf022149d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,85,211,229,106,104,115,255,78,253,57,107,204,225,36,91,240,34,20,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
