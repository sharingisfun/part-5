Increasing numbers of advocates embrace its flexibility: you choose which two days of the week are your 'fast' days; you lose weight and the diet is sustainable and healthy over the long-term, unlike many other diets. This book has 100 recipes, 4 weeks of sample menus and is packed with tips on how to integrate the 5:2 Lifestyle into your lifestyle. It explains the benefits of intermittent fasting and how it works - both for weight loss and also for health - and sets out the Golden Rules for the non-fast days. There are 30 recipes for fast days that are 500 calories and under. These 'Super 500' recipes are composed of wholegrain fibre to slow digestion, protein, healthy fats and fresh vegetables for delicious food with all-important texture, colour and taste, so fasting day food is tasty and satisfying.\n\nAbout the Authors\nDelphine de Montalier is a French stylist and recipe writer, who believes in eating locally and healthily.
