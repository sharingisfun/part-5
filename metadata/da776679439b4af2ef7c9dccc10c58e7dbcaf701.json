It was released as Elevator to the Gallows in the USA and as Lift to the Scaffold in the UK. It stars Jeanne Moreau and Maurice Ronet as criminal lovers whose perfect crime begins to unravel when Ronet is trapped in an elevator. The film is often associated by critics with the film noir style.The score by Miles Davis has been described by jazz critic Phil Johnson as &quot;the loneliest trumpet sound you will ever hear, and the model for sad-core music ever since. Hear it and weep.&quot;\nAscenseur pour l'ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°chafaud is an album by jazz musician Miles Davis. It was recorded at Le Poste Parisien Studio in Paris on December 4 and 5, 1957. The album features the musical cues for the 1958 Louis Malle film Ascenseur pour l'ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°chafaud.\n\nJean-Paul Rappeneau, a jazz fan and Malle's assistant at the time, suggested asking Miles Davis to create the film's soundtrack - possibly inspired by the Modern Jazz Quartet's recording for Roger Vadim's Sait-on jamais (Does One Ever Know), released a few months earlier in 1957.\n\nMiles was booked to perform at the Club St-Germain in Paris for November 1957. Rappeneau introduced him to Malle, and Miles agreed to record the music after attending a private screening. On December 4, he brought his four sidemen to the recording studio without having had them prepare anything. Miles only gave the musicians a few rudimentary harmonic sequences he had assembled in his hotel room, and, once the plot was explained, the band improvised without any precomposed theme, while edited loops of the musically relevant film sequences were projected in the background.\n\nJazz Track, an album that contains ten songs from this soundtrack, received a 1960 Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Performance, Solo or Small Group.\n\nFormat:   mp3\nBitrate:  320\nEncoder:  L.A.M.E.\nEncoder settings: CBR, Secure Mode\n\nTrack List:\n1.
