Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t facts work? Why, that is, did the obviously intelligent man beside him sincerely believe in Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden and a six-thousand-year-old Earth, in spite of the evidence against them?\n\nIt was the start of a journey that would lead Storr all over the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€from Texas to Warsaw to the Outer HebridesÃ¢â‚¬â€meeting an extraordinary cast of modern heretics whom he tries his best to understand. Storr tours Holocaust sites with famed denier David Irving and a band of neo-Nazis, experiences his own murder during Ã¢â‚¬Å“past life regressionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hypnosis, discusses the looming One World Government an iconic climate skeptic, and investigates the tragic life and death of a woman who believed her parents were high priests in a baby-eating cult.\n\nUsing a unique mix of highly personal memoir, investigative journalism, and the latest research from neuroscience and experimental psychology, Storr reveals how the stories we tell ourselves about the world invisibly shape our beliefs, and how the neurological Ã¢â‚¬Å“hero makerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ inside us all can so easily lead to self-deception, toxic partisanship and science denial.
