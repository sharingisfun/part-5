S. NaipaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impassioned and prescient travelogue of his journeys through his ancestral homeland, with a new preface by the author.\n\nArising out of NaipaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelong obsession and passion for a country that is at once his and totally alien, India: A Million Mutinies Now relates the stories of many of the people he met traveling there more than fifty years ago. He explores how they have been steered by the innumerable frictions present in Indian societyÃ¢â‚¬â€the contradictions and compromises of religious faith, the whim and chaos of random political forces. This book represents NaipaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last word on his homeland, complementing his two other India travelogues, An Area of Darkness and India: A Wounded Civilization.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nTrinidadian journalist-novelist Naipaul stresses that much has changed since his 1962 trip to India, which yielded his darkly pessimistic book India: A Wounded Civilization. In this kaleidoscopic, layered travelogue, he portrays &quot;a country of a million little mutinies,&quot; reeling with &quot;rage and revolt,&quot; as percolating ideas of freedom shake loose the old moral ethos rooted in caste and class. Despite what he terms regional, religious and sectarian excesses, Naipaul sees possibilities for regeneration in the new freedoms, yet this skewed essay is fraught with bewilderment and sorrow as he reels off a familiar litany of problems--terrible poverty, shoddy manufactured goods, ugly neo-modern architecture, etc.--and comes to terms with his own past: his ancestors were indentured servants of Indian descent. Most interesting here are the dozens of first-person stories by Indians themselves, ranging from a wealthy young stockbroker to anti-religionists to a publisher of women's magazines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07ab300a1a1214d6cda8fb2db73a5f01ccec760c","amp;dn":"India+-+A+Million+Mutinies+Now+-+V+S+Naipaul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07ab300a1a1214d6cda8fb2db73a5f01ccec760c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,171,48,10,26,18,20,214,205,168,251,45,183,58,95,1,204,236,118,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
