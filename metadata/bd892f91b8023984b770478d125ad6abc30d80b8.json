Medical Biochemistry: Human Metabolism in Health and Disease provides a concise yet thorough explanation of human metabolism and its role in health and diseases. Focusing on the physiological context of human metabolism without extensive consideration of the mechanistic principles of underlying enzymology, the books serves as both a primary text and resource for students and professional in medical, dental, and allied health programs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd892f91b8023984b770478d125ad6abc30d80b8","amp;dn":"Medical+Biochemistry+-+Human+Metabolism+in+Health+and+Disease+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd892f91b8023984b770478d125ad6abc30d80b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,137,47,145,184,2,57,132,183,112,71,141,18,90,214,171,195,13,128,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
