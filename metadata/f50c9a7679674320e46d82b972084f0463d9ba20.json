He was in Istanbul, Turkey, and Heidi Baker, a missionary from Mozambique, began to pray for him. In the midst of her prayer, she suddenly saw, in her spirit, Darren filming the occult and demonic. The the Lord gave her this word for Darren: Ã¢â‚¬Å“You must go into the darkness to show the light.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Neither Darren or Heidi had the slightest clue what any of this might mean, and the last thing on DarrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind at that point was a Ã¢â‚¬Å“sequelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Finger of God, which he still had yet to even put together!\n\nFinger of God was released in late December, 2007. Darren had no marketing plan, no financial backers, and no distributers who were even remotely interested. He put it online, and word of mouth began to turn his strange, little film into an underground hit in the truest sense of the word. To date it has sold more than 60,000 copies, and has been seen by millions of people around the world.\n\nThe success of Finger of God opened up the possibility for Darren to move forward in his next production: Furious Love.\n\nDarren and his faithful crew of two, Braden Heckman and Matt Bilen, began filming Furious Love in July, 2008, in Tanzania. The only direction Darren had for the film was to accomplish the two things he knew the Lord had told him to do. The reality of the war should be easy enough to show, but how does one film love? How does one translate the devastating effects of unconditional love from God onto a screen? This was the question that haunted Darren and his crew everywhere they went, and so they just delved further into the darkness, hoping at each stop that God would prove Himself faithful and that He would show up when the cameras were rolling. They were ever cognizant that if God did not show up, they had no film.\n\nAbout Father of Lights\n\nFather of Lights is the final film in the Finger of God/Furious Love trilogy. It is big, epic, and above all, challenging. If I were to have to explain what it is about in a nutshell, I would put it like this: if Finger of God is about GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power, and Furious Love is about GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love, then Father of Lights is about GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart. I went into making this film by asking the simple question: who is God? I wanted to know His character, His personality, and who He truly is. To answer this question, we had to peel back the many layers of religious garbage that has been passed onto him through generations. That He is angry. Vengeful. Wrathful. And in general, that He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like you very much. The truth, as you will see vibrantly in this film, is that He is the most loving, compassionate, and wonderful Father you can imagine.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f50c9a7679674320e46d82b972084f0463d9ba20","amp;dn":"POtHS+3+-+Bible+-+110+-+Finger+of+God+-+Furious+Love+-+Father+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f50c9a7679674320e46d82b972084f0463d9ba20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,12,154,118,121,103,67,32,228,109,130,185,114,8,79,4,99,217,186,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
