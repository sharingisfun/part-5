Malone, Yuri van Geest\n\n&quot;EXPONENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS should be required reading for anyone interested in the ways exponential technologies are reinventing best practices in business.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Ray Kurwzeil, Director of Engineering at Google \n\nIn business, performance is key. In performance, how you organize can be the key to growth. \n\nIn the past five years, the business world has seen the birth of a new breed of companyÃ¢â‚¬â€the Exponential OrganizationÃ¢â‚¬â€that has revolutionized how a company can accelerate its growth by using technology. An ExO can eliminate the incremental, linear way traditional companies get bigger, leveraging assets like community, big data, algorithms, and new technology into achieving performance benchmarks ten times better than its peers. \n\nThree luminaries of the business worldÃ¢â‚¬â€Salim Ismail, Yuri van Geest, and Mike MaloneÃ¢â‚¬â€have researched this phenomenon and documented ten characteristics of Exponential Organizations. Here, in EXPONENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS, they walk the reader through how any company, from a startup to a multi-national, can become an ExO, streamline its performance, and grow to the next level. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“EXPONENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS is the most pivotal book in its class. Salim examines the future of organizations and offers readers his insights on the concept of Exponential Organizations, because he himself embodies the strategy, structure, culture, processes, and systems of this new breed of company.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€John Hagel, The Center for the Edge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32f51e02d7b3e9bf8435c6c98db4ab67a1baa43","amp;dn":"Exponential+Organizations%3A+Why+new+organizations+are+ten+times+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32f51e02d7b3e9bf8435c6c98db4ab67a1baa43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,47,81,224,45,123,62,155,248,67,92,108,152,219,74,182,122,27,170,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
