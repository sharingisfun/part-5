It includes outtakes from the semi-aborted Who concept album Lifehouse as well as homages to his mentor Meher Baba. Several songs on Who Came First as well as nearly all bonus tracks on the 1992 and 2006 re-releases first appeared in Townshend's other tribute albums Happy Birthday, I Am, and With Love. One dollar from each sale of the 1972 album went to charities. The gatefold cover includes two stills of Meher Baba from the Louis van Gasteren film Beyond Words.\n\nWHO CAME FIRST [320k MP3]\n\n \n01. &quot;Pure And Easy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:32 \n02. &quot;Evolution&quot; (Ronnie Lane, sung by Lane with Townshend on lead guitar) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 \n03. &quot;Forever's No Time At All&quot; (Billy Nicholls, Katie Mclnnerney) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06 \n04. &quot;Let's See Action&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:25 \n05. &quot;Time Is Passing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 \n06. &quot;There's A Heartache Following Me&quot; (Ray Baker, sung by Pete Townshend) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 \n07. &quot;Sheraton Gibson&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37 \n08. &quot;Content&quot; (Maud Kennedy/Pete Townshend) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58 \n09. &quot;Parvardigar&quot; (based on a prayer by Meher Baba, sung by Pete Townshend) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:46 \n\nRe-release bonus tracks\n\n10. &quot;His Hands&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:11 \n11. &quot;The Seeker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34 \n12. &quot;Day of Silence&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53 \n13. &quot;Sleeping Dog&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59 \n14. &quot;The Love Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59 \n15. &quot;Lantern Cabin&quot; (piano) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12 \n16. &quot;Mary Jane&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35 \n17. &quot;I Always Say&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:50 \n18. &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot; (song by Cole Porter, sung by Pete Townshend) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c7bda04493e62fb328bee291f6daf8bedc9af44","amp;dn":"Pete+Townshend+-+%5C%27Who+Came+First+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D%5C%27+%2AFIXED%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c7bda04493e62fb328bee291f6daf8bedc9af44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,123,218,4,73,62,98,251,50,139,238,41,31,109,175,139,237,201,175,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
