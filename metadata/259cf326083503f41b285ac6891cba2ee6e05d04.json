They are the first installments in the sixth generation of the PokÃƒÂ©mon series of role-playing games. First announced on January 8, 2013, by Satoru Iwata through a special Nintendo Direct,[2] both X and Y were released worldwide on October 12, 2013,[1] making them the first Nintendo-published retail games to have such a global simultaneous release in all key regions.[3]\n\nAs with previous installments, each game follows the journey of a young PokÃƒÂ©mon trainer (and the trainer's friends) as they train PokÃƒÂ©mon. This time, the game takes place in the Kalos regionÃ¢â‚¬â€based on FranceÃ¢â‚¬â€with the object of the game being to thwart the schemes of the nefarious criminal organization Team Flare, all while attempting to challenge the PokÃƒÂ©mon League Champion. X and Y introduced 70 new PokÃƒÂ©mon species, and includes new features such as the new Fairy type, character customization, updated battle and training mechanics, and completely rendered polygonal 3D graphics (as opposed to the sprites used in previous generations). A new form of PokÃƒÂ©mon evolution, known as &quot;Mega Evolution,&quot; allows players to further evolve many species of fully evolved PokÃƒÂ©mon, with 30 evolutions currently available. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while either can be played separately, trading PokÃƒÂ©mon between the two games is, as with past titles, necessary in order for a player to obtain every PokÃƒÂ©mon species.\n\nHeader has been zeroed to protect original copy.
