Among the floppy disks, mouse pads, and post-it notes was a stack of small paperback books, so I took one home to read. The book was Peopleware, by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister. This book was one of the most influential books I've ever read. The best way to describe it would be as an Anti-Dilbert Manifesto. Ever wonder why everybody at Microsoft gets their own office, with walls and a door that shuts? It's in there. Why do managers give so much leeway to their teams to get things done? That's in there too. Why are there so many jelled SWAT teams at Microsoft that are remarkably productive? Mainly because Bill Gates has built a company full of managers who read Peopleware. I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is the one thing every software manager needs to read... not just once, but once a year.&quot;\n\nThere is now a third edition of this classic, which I haven't gotten hold of yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9acff24c8866d442e4f02ffdb88ff693829f7083","amp;dn":"Peopleware+2nd+Edition+-+Tom+DeMarco+%26amp%3B+Timothy+Lister","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9acff24c8866d442e4f02ffdb88ff693829f7083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,207,242,76,136,102,212,66,228,240,47,253,184,143,246,147,130,159,112,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
