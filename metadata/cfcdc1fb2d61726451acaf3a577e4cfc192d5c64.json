During their career, they released three albums and numerous EPs. You can hear their influence today on so many releases across the rock genre. Members have gone on to form The Mars Volta, Sparta, and various other projects. \n\nThe music of At the Drive-In is very complex. Although heavily influenced by post-hardcore in the vein of Fugazi, there is a strong progressive rock influence as well. Additionally, ethnic musical styles such as Latin Salsa and Lebanese Chaabi also feature heavily into At The Drive-In&amp;#039;s sound. Furthermore, on the Vaya EP and their album Relationship of Command, the band incorporated elements of electronica and dub into their sound. Like At the Drive-In, contemporaries such as Les Savy Fav and The Dismemberment Plan were also experimenting with those same sounds within the context of art punk around the same time. Singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala&amp;#039;s lyrics are renown for their surreal, cryptic quality and usage of a wide volcabulary. Although At the Drive-In&amp;#039;s lyrics have been interpreted as political, specifically leftist, in nature, Bixler-Zavala has been quoted as saying &quot;We&amp;#039;re not Communists, we&amp;#039;re not pinko... we can&amp;#039;t be, &amp;#039;cause you pay to come and see us and we sell t-shirts at our gigs&quot;. \n\nIn/Casino/Out is the second full-length LP by At the Drive-In, released in 1998. It was recorded as a live studio album, with the intention of better capturing the energy and sound of their live shows.The album marks a clear middle ground between the dirty, lo-fi sound of the their first album, Acrobatic Tenement, and the sleeker, more produced sound heard on Relationship of Command. \nThe album also features Jim Ward&amp;#039;s return to the band, who notably sings his debut lead vocals on the track &quot;Hourglass&quot;. \n\nRaw energy in both performance and music has not recently been captured by a band quite the way At the Drive-In does. Anyone who has experienced their live show knows just what this five-piece rock/punk/emo band from Texas is capable of. The music takes a lot from driving melodic punk riffs, meshed together with quieter interlocking note-picking. With the catchy yet powerful music comes extremely forceful, heartfelt, and intense vocals that you can just feel the passion exploding from. Lyrics are often abstract and personal, but not too far gone. This is a must-have for just about anyone, if you listen to it and aren&amp;#039;t fully amazed, just go see them live and the album will take on an entirely new meaning for you. \n\nAlthough generally, one of their other three major albums (Acrobatic Tenement, Relationship of Command, and the Vaya EP) are cited as their best work and/or works, after listening, In/Casino/Out refuses to be cast off as merely a great album in the back catalogue of At the Drive-In. \n\n&quot;Displaying an earnest intensity befitting pre-irony U2, At The Drive-In are an exhilarating and exhausting experience--the sight of five young men ever pushing against and beyond the limits of physical and emotional endurance with crusader zeal&quot; -Rolling Stone. \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfcdc1fb2d61726451acaf3a577e4cfc192d5c64","amp;dn":"At+The+Drive-In+-+In+Casino+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfcdc1fb2d61726451acaf3a577e4cfc192d5c64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,205,193,251,45,97,114,100,81,172,175,58,87,126,76,252,25,45,92,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
