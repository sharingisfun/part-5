He was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature for his &quot;bold and brilliant renovation of the drama and the stage.&quot;\n\nPirandello's work is impressive by its sheer volume.  He wrote hundreds of short stories, many of which are represented here in various translations.  Of his six novels the best known are THE LATE MATTIA PASCAL (1904) and SHOOT (1916).\n\nBut Pirandello's greatest achievement are his plays and tragic farces, which are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd.  Pirandello is always preoccupied with the problem of identity.  The self exists to him only in relation to others; it consists of changing facets that hide an inscrutable abyss.  In a play like &quot;Right You Are (If You Think You Are)&quot; (1918), two people hold contradictory notions about the identity of a third person.  The protagonist in &quot;To Clothe the Naked&quot; (1923) tries to establish her individuality by assuming various identities, which are successively stripped from her; she gradually realizes her true position in the social order and in the end dies naked, without a social mask, in both her own and her friends' eyes.  Similarly in &quot;Henry IV&quot; (1922), a man supposedly mad imagines that he is a medieval emperor, and his imagination and reality are strangely confused.  The analysis and dissolution of a unified self are carried to an extreme in &quot;Six Characters in Search of An Author&quot; (1921) where the stage itself, the symbol of appearance versus reality, becomes the setting of the play.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF or ePUB/MOBI format as indicated:\n\n\n                                    == Plays ==\n\n* EACH IN HIS OWN WAY &amp; TWO OTHER PLAYS (Dent, 1930).
