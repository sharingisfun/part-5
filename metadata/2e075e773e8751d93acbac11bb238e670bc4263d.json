They are best known for their 1986 top five hit single &quot;Keep Your Hands to Yourself&quot;, and draw inspiration from Chuck Berry, Little Feat, and AC/DC, among others.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeorgia Satellites is the first album released by The Georgia Satellites. It contains their biggest hit, &quot;Keep Your Hands to Yourself&quot; (which reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, behind Bon Jovi's &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot;), and another minor hit, &quot;Battleship Chains,&quot; written by Terry Anderson. It also contains a cover of &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story,&quot; written by Rod Stewart and Ron Wood. Most of the other songs were written by lead singer/rhythm guitarist Dan Baird, except &quot;Red Light,&quot; which he co-wrote with Neill Bogan, and &quot;Can't Stand the Pain,&quot; written by lead guitarist Rick Richards, who also takes lead vocal on the tune.\n\nThe band would release two more studio albums after this one, but none featured a song with nearly the radio and MTV success as &quot;Keep Your Hands to Yourself,&quot; and the band finally split in the early 1990s.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e075e773e8751d93acbac11bb238e670bc4263d","amp;dn":"Georgia+Satellites+-+Georgia+Satellites+%5B1986%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e075e773e8751d93acbac11bb238e670bc4263d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,7,94,119,62,135,81,217,58,203,172,17,187,35,142,103,11,196,38,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
