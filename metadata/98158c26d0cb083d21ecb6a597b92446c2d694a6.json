Compared to the studio album, the symphonic flourishes donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem quite as overwhelming -- the attention is drawn to Sting and his songs, not to the orchestrations -- and the show is paced expertly, turning Live in Berlin into a bit of sophisticated comfort food for longtime Sting fans.\n\n\ntracklist:\n01.
