I was a kid and basically said, &quot;Hey, Mom, this is a real CD! Can I keep it?&quot; &quot;Hmm, is it age appropriate? What's on it?&quot; &quot;Classical music, I think.&quot; &quot;Okay, kid, whatever.&quot; This was the first classical music I'd ever actively listened to (my parents were into Motown, Sade, Maxwell), and my mind was completely blown. This album fed my desire to play clarinet and expanded my musical horizons.\n\nI've memorized every note and I've played it so many times that the disc is ratty. I've taken special care with it over the past decade and flipped out when I found it on Amazon. I think this is the perfect Christmas album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cebe6061ef229f60f1ba6bec90fe8285eb56966c","amp;dn":"Collection+of+Holiday+Music+-+Classical+Christmas+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cebe6061ef229f60f1ba6bec90fe8285eb56966c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,190,96,97,239,34,159,96,241,186,107,236,144,254,130,133,235,86,150,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
