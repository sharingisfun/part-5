The goal is to guide the permanent dentition into the line of the dental arches, avoiding complex orthodontic treatment for teeth displaced far from their ideal position, and thereby reducing orthodontic treatment time. This book covers growth of the jaws and tooth development, and explains the correct timing of interceptive management. It also discusses orthodontic assessment, special investigations and comprehensive management of the mixed dentition, taking in the issues of early crowding, impaction, supernumerary and supplemental teeth, dental arch expansion, space maintenance and space management. In line with best available evidence, it provides clear treatment objectives and detailed treatment planning advice.\n\nPractical, accessible and illustrated with a wealth of colour images, this is an ideal clinical companion for general dental practitioners, oral surgeons, paediatric dentists and orthodontists. It is also a valuable reference for all training grades.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d95a97a6b4633cbc8b8a5fcbf43131fccc0d4e3","amp;dn":"Interceptive+Orthodontics+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d95a97a6b4633cbc8b8a5fcbf43131fccc0d4e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,149,169,122,107,70,51,203,200,184,165,252,191,67,19,31,204,192,212,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
