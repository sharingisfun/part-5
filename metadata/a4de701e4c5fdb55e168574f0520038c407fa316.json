The film records his frustration over his physical handicap (the growth in his legs was stunted by a childhood accident), his efforts to &quot;lose&quot; himself in Paris' bawdy Montmartre district, and his career as a painter, which brought him money only when he turned out advertising posters--but what posters! Toulouse-Lautrec's drinking and debauchery lead to his early death, which in the hands of director John Huston is staged (brilliantly) in the manner of a musical comedy finale. This is the film in which Zsa Zsa Gabor actually acts, in the role of demimonde entertainer Jane Avril. As a bonus, the film's musical score (by Georges Auric) managed to hit the Top Ten charts in the U.S. When this immensely successful film was released to television in the late '50s, Moulin Rouge proved to be one of the strongest-ever incentives to purchase a color TV set. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044926/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044926/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-26525&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-26525&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\n\n\nJosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Ferrer\t ... \tHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec / The Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec\n\n\tZsa Zsa Gabor\t... \tJane Avril\n\tSuzanne Flon\t... \tMyriamme Hayam\n\tClaude Nollier\t... \tCountess de Toulouse-Lautrec\n\tKatherine Kath\t... \tLa Goulue\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:47:30\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  Ratio: 4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1300 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4de701e4c5fdb55e168574f0520038c407fa316","amp;dn":"Moulin+Rouge+%281952%29++Zsa+Zsa+Gabor+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4de701e4c5fdb55e168574f0520038c407fa316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,222,112,30,76,95,219,85,225,104,87,79,5,32,3,140,64,127,163,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
