However, the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions; in a foreword to one of the many publications of the novella, noted science writer Isaac Asimov described Flatland as &quot;The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.&quot; As such, the novella is still popular amongst mathematics, physics and computer science students.\n\nIn the book, people are portrayed as polygons whose social class is directly proportional to the number of sides they have; therefore, triangles, having only three sides, are at the bottom of the social ladder and are considered generally unintelligent, while the Priests are composed of multi-sided polygons whose shapes approximate a circle, which is considered to be the &quot;perfect&quot; shape.\n\nAudiobook is available for free download at -  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://librivox.org/flatland-a-romance-of-many-dimensions-by-edwin-abbott-abbott&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://librivox.org/flatland-a-romance-of-many-dimensions-by-edwin-abbott-abbott&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9abc81ba02dc4ec3f01e37fb5fe741583cb969bf","amp;dn":"Flatland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9abc81ba02dc4ec3f01e37fb5fe741583cb969bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,188,129,186,2,220,78,195,240,30,55,251,95,231,65,88,60,185,105,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
