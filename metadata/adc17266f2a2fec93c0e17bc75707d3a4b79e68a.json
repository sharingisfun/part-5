We spent some time with a preview version of the game, and you can read our impressions behind the cut.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img-kiev.fotki.yandex.ru/get/5817/74227649.8a/0_75c47_583ae7b7_XL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img-kiev.fotki.yandex.ru/get/5817/74227649.8a/0_75c47_583ae7b7_XL.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/7364/TheGoldenYears1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/7364/TheGoldenYears1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1229.photobucket.com/albums/ee473/pashkevic4/6-32.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1229.photobucket.com/albums/ee473/pashkevic4/6-32.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe story follows the adventures of a frontier family made up of Gertrude, her husband Samuel, and their young son Jacob. The family falls on hard times after their general store burns to the ground and Samuel gets thrown in jail because he can't replay the debt. Gertrude starts a new business venture by establishing a mining town in Georgia in order to raise the money to pay off their loans and free her husband.\nGameplay resembles My Kingdom for the Princess resource management with a dash of Build-a-lot-style civil engineering. From your home base, the Municipal Building, you'll send workers out to harvest resources (like gold and wood), and construct buildings to complete level goals.\n\nBuildings can be residential, like covered wagons for people to live in, which earn rent; or industrial, like sawmills that produce extra wood. There are also special buildings that serve as amenities to the townspeople, like water towers. You can only build residential builders if they're within a certain proximity to these amenities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adc17266f2a2fec93c0e17bc75707d3a4b79e68a","amp;dn":"The+Golden+Years+-+Way+Out+West+-+Full+PreCracked+-+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adc17266f2a2fec93c0e17bc75707d3a4b79e68a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,193,114,102,242,162,254,201,60,14,23,188,117,112,125,58,75,121,230,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
