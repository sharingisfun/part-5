After a selection of applications, they look at the latest achievements in traditional solution-phase applications, including photochromic-based molecular logic operations and memory, optically modulated supramolecular system and sensors, as well as light-tunable chemical reactions. The book then describes the hot-spot areas of photo-switchable surfaces and nanomaterials, photochromic-based luminescence/electronic devices and bulk materials together with light-regulated biological and bio-chemical systems. The authors conclude with a focus on current industrial applications and the future outlook for these materials.\r\nWritten with both senior researchers and entrants to the field in mind","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afea079be046cb812163645cf18dbc670952ec98","amp;dn":"Photochromic+Materials+-+Preparation%2C+Properties+and+Application","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afea079be046cb812163645cf18dbc670952ec98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,234,7,155,224,70,203,129,33,99,100,92,241,141,188,103,9,82,236,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
