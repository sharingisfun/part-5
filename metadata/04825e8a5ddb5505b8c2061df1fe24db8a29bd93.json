And with this change came an opportunity - that of piloting a mission into Jupiter's atmosphere, and ultimately of making first contact with the life forms he discovers there. Picking up the threads of humanity versus artificial intelligences and machines, and of encounters with the alien, this collaborative novel between two superb writers is a sequel to Howard Falcon's adventures. A proper science fiction adventure, this is perfect for fans of Golden Age SF as well as the modern SF reader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04825e8a5ddb5505b8c2061df1fe24db8a29bd93","amp;dn":"Stephen+Baxter%2C+Alastair+Reynolds%3A+The+Medusa+Chronicles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04825e8a5ddb5505b8c2061df1fe24db8a29bd93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,130,94,138,93,219,85,5,184,194,6,29,241,254,36,219,138,41,189,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
