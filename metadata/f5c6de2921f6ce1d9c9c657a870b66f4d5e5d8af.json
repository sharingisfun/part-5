Written for GPs, physiotherapists and sports therapists to tailor diagnosis and suggested therapy, as well as for coaches and athletes, and for keen amateur sports people who want to know what to do if they injure themselves. A clear and easy to follow design with one injury explored per page. Includes the most common lower and upper extremity injuries occurring in team sports such as football/rugby/ cricket, and some non-team sports injuries (tennis, running, swimming, skiing). Many people with a sports injury end up giving up exercising or cause further damage because their injury isn't treated properly - either treated as 'non-urgent' because it was caused by sporting activity, or treatment is delayed because of long waiting times, or GPs/physios are unsure of the diagnosis and treatment of sports injuries. GPs usually immediately refer sports injuries to consultants, with a long waiting list for consultation/scan. This means patients suffer for longer, give up exercising and often cause more damage by not following an exercise programme in the meantime. This book will offer diagnosis and how to treat/investigate and refer. Training advice during convalescence will also be given.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c6de2921f6ce1d9c9c657a870b66f4d5e5d8af","amp;dn":"Sports+Injuries+Handbook+-+Diagnosis+and+Management+-+PDF+-+WD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c6de2921f6ce1d9c9c657a870b66f4d5e5d8af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,198,222,41,33,246,206,29,156,156,101,122,135,11,102,244,213,229,216,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
