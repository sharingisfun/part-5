This course is designed for users that already have a basic working knowledge of Inventor. You will start by learning about 3D sketching, then jump into learning about advanced modeling, including how to sweep with a guide surface, create an area loft, and emboss and engrave parts. Adam will then teach you about advanced modification tools, such as draft, copy object, delete face, and bend part. This video tutorial also covers multi-body modeling and creation, and multi-body assemblies and drawings. Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of applying these advanced tools and techniques to your own Inventor projects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b395656ff33bc195e153a288fa6847544d549442","amp;dn":"InfiniteSkills+-+Mastering+Autodesk+Inventor+-+Advanced+Parts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b395656ff33bc195e153a288fa6847544d549442","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,149,101,111,243,59,193,149,225,83,162,136,250,104,71,84,77,84,148,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
