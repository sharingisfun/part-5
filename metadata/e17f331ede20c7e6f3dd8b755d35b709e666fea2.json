As a young rookie cop, he used his savvy investigation skills to help break the Ted Bundy case. His obsession with turning around the systemic failings he saw as a young police officer led to a successful bid to become Sheriff of Davis County, Utah in 1974. Committed to the highest standards of peace officers serving the public good, Dub proudly established his state's first SWAT team only to see that same unit kill his son-in-law in a controversial standoff thirty years later.\r\nAfter years in public service, Dub now works as a private investigator. His free time is spent investigating the shooting death of his son-in-law Brian Wood. Multiple SWAT teams were involved in trying to arrest Brian, a desperate man sitting in his parked truck threatening no one but himself. Now as a regular citizen, Dub laments what has become of the SWAT team he founded with noble ambitions.\r\nIn Peace Officer, Dub's obsession with bringing to light the truth of his son-in-law's killing is punctuated by his investigation of other SWAT team raids in quiet neighborhoods just miles from where Brian was killed.\r\nThese events reflect a growing national phenomenon of violent SWAT raids and governmental immunity laws gone amok in the War on Drugs. Officers both in cities and small towns like Dub's are routinely armed with military surplus weapons and equipment, and federal incentives to use what they are given. All of this has lead to a 15,000% increase in SWAT team raids in the United States since the late 1970's. Peace Officer follows Dub as he obsessively picks apart these cases from his unique perspective that combines the zeal of a rule-of-law detective with the grief of a victim.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Peace-Officer-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/Peace-Officer-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8f/Peace-Officer-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/Peace-Officer-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Peace-Officer-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Peace-Officer-Screen5.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio BitRate: 384 kbps\r\nAudio Streams: 2.0\r\nAudio Languages: English\r\nRunTime Per Part: 90 min\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.45 GB\r\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Black%20and%20Blue \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=NYPD%3A%20Biggest%20Gang%20in%20New%20York%3F \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Can%20We%20Trust%20the%20Police\r\n\r\n2)  ed2k Links \r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;ed2k://|file|CBC.The.Passionate.Eye.Peace.Officer.HDTV.x264.720p.AC3.MVGroup.org.mkv|1560862856|b29708c8ea8567fd098a986c2549a2af|/&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded by \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Peace_Officer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e17f331ede20c7e6f3dd8b755d35b709e666fea2","amp;dn":"CBC+The+Passionate+Eye+Peace+Officer+x264+720p+AC3+HDTV+MVGroup.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e17f331ede20c7e6f3dd8b755d35b709e666fea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,127,51,30,222,32,199,230,243,221,139,117,93,53,183,9,230,102,254,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
