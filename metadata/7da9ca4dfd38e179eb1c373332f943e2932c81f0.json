Fight hunger, cold, heat and dangerous environment around you. Conquer your environment, build a base, explore your world. But the biggest danger is the other players. Create alliances and destroy your enemies. Hurtworld designed for the hardcore audience and aims to oppress. \r\n\r\nThe game world - it's a huge desert, filled with dangerous creatures, animals and harsh conditions. Even if you are prepared and protected, random incidents can destroy all your plans. \r\n\r\nThe main part of Hurtworld is PvP.
