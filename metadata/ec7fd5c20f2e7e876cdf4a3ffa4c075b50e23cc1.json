The former editor of IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, he is the author of numerous articles and six books about technical communication, including Ethics and Technical Communication: A Critique and Synthesis.\nMike Markel writes the Detectives Seagate and Miner Mystery series, which is set in the fictional small city of Rawlings, Montana, home of Central Montana State University. That university is somewhat like Boise State University, where Mike taught writing, but in Rawlings the weather is colder, the football team less successful, and the murder rate much, much higher. Mike lives with his wife in Boise.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface for Instructors v\nIntroduction for Writers xv\nPart 1 Understanding the Technical Communication Environment 1\n1 Introduction to Technical Communication 2\n2 Understanding Ethical and Legal Considerations 17\n3 Writing Technical Documents 41\n4 Writing Collaboratively 57\nPart 2 Planning the Document 81\n5 A nalyzing Your Audience and Purpose 82\n6 Researching Your Subject 114\n7 Organizing Your Information 146\nPart 3 Developing and Testing the Verbal and Visual Information 169\n8 Communicating Persuasively 170\n9 Emphasizing Important Information 192\n10 Writing Correct and Effective Sentences 215\n11 Designing Print and Online Documents 248\n12 Creating Graphics 294\n13 Reviewing, Evaluating, and Testing Documents and Websites 340\nPart 4 Learning Important Applications 357\n14 Writing Correspondence 358\n15 Writing Job-Application Materials 385\n16 Writing Proposals 419\n17 Writing Informational Reports 445\n18 Writing Recommendation Reports 468\n19 Writing Lab Reports 515\n20 Writing Definitions, Descriptions, and Instructions 533\n21 Making Oral Presentations 576\nAPPENDIX Reference Handbook 605\nA Skimming Your Sources and Taking Notes 606\nB Documenting Your Sources 614\nC Editing and Proofreading Your Documents 658\nD Guidelines for Multilingual Writers (ESL) 677\nSelected Bibliography 693\nReferences 697\nIndex 703\nIndex of Selected Features 730\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/dryd7ojyt/Technical_Communication_11th_Ed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/dryd7ojyt/Technical_Communication_11th_Ed.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec7fd5c20f2e7e876cdf4a3ffa4c075b50e23cc1","amp;dn":"Technical+Communication+%2811th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec7fd5c20f2e7e876cdf4a3ffa4c075b50e23cc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,127,213,194,15,46,126,135,108,223,74,63,250,76,7,91,80,226,60,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
