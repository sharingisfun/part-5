Recording the album was problematic and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector-produced sessions in October 1973 at A&amp;M Studios, and Lennon-produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song &quot;Come Together&quot;, as part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on Rock 'n' Roll. Spector ran away with the session recordings, later being involved in a motor accident, which left the album's tracks unrecoverable until beginning of the Walls and Bridges sessions. With Walls and Bridges coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon expecting to see Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll album.\n\nThe album was released in February 1975, reaching number 6 in both the United Kingdom and the United States, later being certified gold in both countries. The album was supported by the single &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, which peaked at number 20 in the US, and 30 in the UK. The album's cover was taken by JÃƒÂ¼rgen Vollmer during the Beatles' stay in Hamburg. The album would be Lennon's last until 1980; he took a hiatus from recording to raise his son, Sean Lennon.\n\nTrack Listing **** 2010 Remaster **** [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula&quot; (Tex Davis, Gene Vincent) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:39\n    &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller, Ben E.
