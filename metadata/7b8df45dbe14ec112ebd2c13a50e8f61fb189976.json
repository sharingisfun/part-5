Introduction to Advanced Food Process Engineering provides a general reference on various aspects of processing, packaging, storage, and quality control and assessment systems, describing the basic principles and major applications of emerging food processing technologies.\nThe book is divided into three sections, systematically examining processes from different areas of food process engineering.\nSection I covers a wide range of advanced food processing technologies including osmo-concentration of fruits and vegetables, membrane technology, nonthermal processing, emerging drying technologies, CA and MA storage of fruits and vegetables, nanotechnology in food processing, and computational fluid dynamics modeling in food processing.\nSection II describes food safety and various non-destructive quality assessment systems using machine vision systems, vibrational spectroscopy, biosensors, and chemosensors.\nSection III explores waste management, by-product utilization, and energy conservation in food processing industry. With an emphasis on novel food processes, each chapter contains case studies and examples to illustrate state-of-the-art applications of the technologies discussed.\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Jatindra K. Sahu, is an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural Engineering in Assam University, India. His research focuses on developing or improving dairy and food processing technologies in the field of food process engineering. His major contributions to food industries include a continuous heat-acid coagulation unit for continuous production of soft cheese, a sandesh (an Indian milk sweet) production line, technology for bamboo shoot-based nugget production, technology for honey powder production, Light Emitting Diode (LED) based technology for non-thermal pasteurization of fruit juices, and more.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface....vii\nEditor.....ix\nContributors....xi\nSection I ADVANCES ININ FOO D PROCESS ENENGINEEINEEINEEINEERINING\n1 Microwave and Radio Frequency Heating of Food Products: Fundamentals, Modeling, and Applications....3\n2 Emerging Drying Technologies for Agricultural Products....31\n3 Osmo-Concentration of Foods....79\n4 Membrane Processing of Food Materials...109\n5 High Hydrostatic Pressure Processing of Food Materials.....151\n6 High-Voltage Pulsed Electric Field Processing of Foods.....187\n7 Cold Pasteurization of Fruit Juices Using Pulsed Electric Fields........211\n8 Ultrasonic System for Food Processing.....227\n9 CA and MA Storage of Fruits and Vegetables.....257\n10 Innovation in Food Packaging....293\n11 Nanotechnology in Food Processing.....315\n12 Computational Fluid Dynamics in Food Processing.....343\nSection II FOOD SAFETETY AND QUALITITY ASSESSMENTENTENT\n13 Safety and Quality Management in Food Processing.....377\n14 Biosensors for Food Safety......413\n15 Machine Vision Systems for Food Quality Assessment.....447\n16 Vibrational Spectroscopy for Food Processing.....483\n17 Chemosensor (Electronic Nose) for Food Quality Evaluation....521\nSection III WASTE AND BYPRODUCT MANAGEMENT ENT AND ENE ENERGY CONONSERVATIONTIONTIONTION\n18 Waste Management in Food Processing.....559\n19 Waste Minimization and Utilization in the Food Industry: Valorization of Food Industry Wastes and Byproducts.....595\n20 Energy-Efficient Food Processing: Principles and Practices...631\n\nNOTE\nIf you have trouble in reading this book with Adobe reader, then try some other reader like Foxit, nitroPDF or Sumatra.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b8df45dbe14ec112ebd2c13a50e8f61fb189976","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Advanced+Food+Process+Engineering+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b8df45dbe14ec112ebd2c13a50e8f61fb189976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,141,244,93,190,20,236,17,46,189,44,19,165,14,143,97,251,24,153,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
