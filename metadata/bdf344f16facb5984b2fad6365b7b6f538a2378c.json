(The books have also appeared as a single-volume omnibus in the United Kingdom and in North America, titled His Dark Materials.) The trilogy follows the coming-of-age of two children, Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry, as they wander through a series of parallel universes against a backdrop of epic events. Some of the components of the trilogy have won awards, The trilogy as a whole took third place in the BBC&amp;#039;s Big Read poll in 2003.\n\nThe story involves fantasy elements such as witches and armoured polar bears, and alludes to a broad range of ideas from fields such as physics, philosophy, theology and spirituality. The trilogy functions in part as a retelling and inversion of John Milton&amp;#039;s epic, Paradise Lost; Pullman commends humanity for its attainment of wisdom and knowledge rather than condemning it (as in Milton&amp;#039;s poem). Because of this and of other elements such as the negative portrayal of organized religion, the series has drawn criticism from some religious individuals and groups.\n\nPullman&amp;#039;s publishers have primarily marketed the series to young adults, but Pullman also intended to speak to adults.North American printings of The Amber Spyglass have censored passages describing Lyra&amp;#039;s incipient sexuality.\n\nThis Release Contails All the three Parts of the Trilogy in PDF Format.\n\nEnjoy and Keep Seeding.\n\nJackNJack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf344f16facb5984b2fad6365b7b6f538a2378c","amp;dn":"His+Dark+Materials+Trilogy+%5B1-3%5D+EBOOK+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf344f16facb5984b2fad6365b7b6f538a2378c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,243,68,241,111,172,181,152,75,47,173,99,101,183,182,245,56,162,55,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
