Students will find that the text inherently directs them into familiarity with both the basics of design decisions and the standards of industrial components. It combines the straightforward focus on fundamentals that instructors have come to expect, with a modern emphasis on design and new applications. The ninth edition of Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design maintains the approach that has made this book the standard in machine design for nearly 50 years.\n\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Higher Education\nCopyright year: Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2011 Pages: 1104\n\n[poly-technic.blogspot]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b3bf9d745e06c0d682997aedad6837f14eefc96","amp;dn":"Solution+Manual+-+Mechanical+Engineering+Design+9th+Edition+by+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b3bf9d745e06c0d682997aedad6837f14eefc96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,59,249,215,69,224,108,13,104,41,151,174,218,214,131,127,20,238,252,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
