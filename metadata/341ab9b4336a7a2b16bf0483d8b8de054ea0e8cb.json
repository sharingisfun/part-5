And with Total Access, all the music and media resources students need are automatically included with every new copy of the text.\n\nAbout the Authors\nKristine Forney is Professor of Music at California State University, Long Beach, where she regularly teaches music appreciation and music history to undergraduate students. Her understanding of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s students and her highly regarded teaching abilities make her the ideal author for this appreciation-level textbook. She is also a respected scholar who has written extensively on music of the Renaissance, and is a contributor to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.\nAndrew Dell'Antonio is University Distinguished Teaching Professor of Music at the University of Texas at Austin. Winner of the University of Texas Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, he teaches courses in musical historiography, feminist/queer theory, and cultural studies. Dell'Antonio is a specialist in musical repertories of early modern Europe, and his recent work investigates topics as diverse as postmodern modes of hearing and changing listening practices in the early Italian Baroque.\nThe late Joseph Machlis was professor of music at Queens College of the City University of New York. Among his many publications are Introduction to Contemporary Music (Norton) and singing translations for many operas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:341ab9b4336a7a2b16bf0483d8b8de054ea0e8cb","amp;dn":"The+Enjoyment+of+Music+%28Essential+Listening+Edition%2C+2nd+Ed%29%28gnv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"341ab9b4336a7a2b16bf0483d8b8de054ea0e8cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,26,185,180,51,106,122,43,22,191,4,131,216,184,222,5,78,160,232,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
