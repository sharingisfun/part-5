After adding vocalist Anja Oyen Vister, Flunk recorded their debut album, For Sleepyheads Only, and released the record through Guidance. A folkie cover of New Order's &quot;Blue Monday&quot; made a bit of headway in the downbeat boom of 2002.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8673abccc415eeea0a3f727f4eab30c72b52e779","amp;dn":"Flunk+-+Lost+Causes+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8673abccc415eeea0a3f727f4eab30c72b52e779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,115,171,204,196,21,238,234,10,63,114,127,78,171,48,199,43,82,231,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
