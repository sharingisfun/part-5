Beautiful and breathtaking in its scale, the vast expanse of the universe is one that we struggle to study, understand, or even comprehend in terms of its purpose and size. Now take an incredible look at the mysteries and marvels of space in The New Astronomy Book!\n\n-Discover the best ways to observe the heavens, along with up-to-date astronomical data and concepts\n-Learn about the dynamics of planets, stars, galaxies, and models for the cosmology of the universe\n-What we know and are still trying to discover about planets, moons, and comets within our own solar system.\n\nIf you watch the stars at night, you will see how they change. This speaks to the enormity and intricacy of design in the universe. While the stars appear timeless, they instead reflect an all-powerful Creator who speaks of them in the Bible. Many ancient pagan cultures taught that the changing stars caused the seasons to change, but unlike these pagan teaching, the Book of Job gives credit to God for both changing stars and seasons (Job 38:31-33). When Job looked at Orion, he saw about what we see today, even though he may have lived as much as 4,000 years ago.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Danny R. Faulkner has a B.S. (Math), M.S.
