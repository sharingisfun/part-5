But once AUTHORISED, the P&amp;M Chainer acts as a host application that can also load and &quot;Chain&quot; any VST effects and/or VSTi virtual instruments.\n\nUsers can therefore use the Chainer to save great effect presets or any VSTi virtual instrument patches that can be recalled from any DAW at anytime needed.\n\nFor example, let's say you are a guitarist and want to save typical sound patches. The Chainer enables you to load up to 32 effects in series or parallel. So you may want to load and save a compressor, an EQ, an Amp sim, a delay, a reverb, a chorus, etc, and save the whole thing within a patch that can be loaded in other sessions or even other DAWs. The same concept can be applied to vocal patches, drum patches, or any other typical effect chains that you want to recall in future sessions. A time saver !\n\nDrag and Drop functionalities enables users to conveniently change the order of the effects and/or virtual instruments they load within the Chainer. A mixer section enables users to solo, mute and control the level, Mix and Pan of each effects or instruments loaded in the chainer. The chainer also provides convenient Spectrum, 1/3 Octave Graphic EQ, Phase and audio Waveform visualisation to control the audio signals processed within the Chainer...\n\nThe chainer natively contains all of the 45 P&amp;M V.I.P. Series plug-ins making it easy to save/load chained presets of your favourite P&amp;M Plug-ins. The Chainer is FREE for all REGISTERED P&amp;M Plug-in owners. Therefore, the Chainer will automatically detect any authorised P&amp;M plug-ins, ready to use. They can be chained in series or parallel to save/load presets that can be used in other sessions or even other DAWs.\n\nWhen AUTHORISED, the Chainer works as a VST Wrapper utility that can load and &quot;Chain&quot; any VST effects or VSTi virtual instruments. The Chainer loads as a plug-in within all major recording host applications including Pro Tools and can open up many creative sound layering and effects chaining options.\n\nThe Chainer was also made with Pro Tools users in mind, as it includes AAX 64bit format plug-in versions that allow you to wrap any VST instruments or effects inside of Pro Tools.\n\nIn addition to being a versatile audio effect rack, the P&amp;M Chainer plug-in also doubles as virtual instrument host that can be inserted on any MIDI /Instrument track. With P&amp;M Chainer, you can merge all of the best production tools in one easy to use plug-in.\n\nA standalone version will shortly be released. It will enable users to conveniently chain effects or synth patches for live performances.\n\nVersions V1.7 (2015/03/26)\n\nNew features:\n\nThe effect version now supports external side chain input.\nThe synth version now includes multiple output busses (up to 16 output channels).\nThe standalone application now offers up to 16 audio I/O.\nSub plug-ins audio i/o routing: connect the inputs and outputs of each plug-in to any channel.\nLatency is now compensated for individual channels when a plug-in is processing only a subset of all available channels.\n\nFixes:\n\nFixed side chain input always fed with silence for some Audio Unit plug-ins.\nFixed issue with standalone application: displayed i/o were not reset properly when changing i/o configuration.\nFixed a crash with some VST plug-ins that use long preset names.\nFixed demo version popup window freezing Pro Tools in some situations.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeyGen APP OS X [GlocK E][packet-dada].\nmagnet:?xt=urn:99358F7206A3A19CBF2BC8FF463A234B77F8EB9D\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtscene.cc\ncastradio.net\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (03)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8202e63db2bb0e3c8da74b747caec47e512c4394","amp;dn":"Blue+Cat+Audio+-+BC+PatchWork+v1.7+OS+X+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8202e63db2bb0e3c8da74b747caec47e512c4394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,2,230,61,178,187,14,60,141,167,75,116,124,174,196,126,81,44,67,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
