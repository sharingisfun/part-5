Part II describes Mathematics with Maple and Mathematica by using equivalent problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7dc5a68a30bf0981635e94bede18c8e626e6203","amp;dn":"Maple+and+Mathematica+-+A+Problem+Solving+Approach+for+Mathemati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7dc5a68a30bf0981635e94bede18c8e626e6203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,220,90,104,163,11,240,152,22,53,233,75,237,225,140,142,98,110,98,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
