Although few other softwares / applications displayed missing Outlook.pst, however none could recover the full file which was approx 1.5GB in size. Most of the professional recovery software were quite complex and took hours to scan without being much of help. Some recovery applications showed part of the missing outlook file and others came out with no result. However the two softwares which did the work of recovering 100% data (pst file) and which were easy to use are DiskInternals Uneraser and O&amp;O DiskRecovery.
