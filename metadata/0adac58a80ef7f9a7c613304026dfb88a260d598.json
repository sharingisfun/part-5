Now the fragile seers are in greater danger than ever beforeâ€”both from their own weaknesses and from those who seek to control their divinations for wicked purposes. In desperate need of answers, Simon Wolfgard, a shape-shifter leader among the Others, has no choice but to enlist blood prophet Meg Corbynâ€™s help, regardless of the risks she faces by aiding him.\r\n\r\nMeg is still deep in the throes of her addiction to the euphoria she feels when she cuts and speaks prophecy. She knows each slice of her blade tempts death. But Others and humans alike need answers, and her visions may be Simonâ€™s only hope of ending the conflict","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0adac58a80ef7f9a7c613304026dfb88a260d598","amp;dn":"Anne+Bishop+-Vision+in+Silver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0adac58a80ef7f9a7c613304026dfb88a260d598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,218,197,138,128,239,127,154,124,97,51,4,2,109,251,136,162,96,213,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
