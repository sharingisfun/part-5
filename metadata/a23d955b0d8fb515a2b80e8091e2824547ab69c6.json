(NOT MY RIP)\n\nAllmusic.com Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nThe Sundays' debut album builds on the layered, ringing guitar hooks and unconventional pop melodies of the Smiths, adding more ethereal vocals and a stronger backbeat. As evidenced by the lilting, melancholy single &quot;Here's Where the Story Ends,&quot; it's a winning combination, making Reading, Writing and Arithmetic a thoroughly engaging debut.\n\nTracks\n1\tSkin &amp; Bones\t\t\t\t4:17\n2\tHere's Where the Story Ends\t\t3:55\n3\tCan't Be Sure\t\t\t\t3:25\n4\tI Won\t\t\t\t\t4:22\n5\tHideous Towns\t\t\t\t3:48\n6\tYou're Not the Only One I Know\t\t3:51\n7\tA Certain Someone\t\t\t4:25\n8\tI Kicked a Boy\t\t\t\t2:18\n9\tMy Finest Hour\t\t\t\t3:59\n10\tJoy\t\t\t\t\t4:10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a23d955b0d8fb515a2b80e8091e2824547ab69c6","amp;dn":"The+Sundays+-+Reading%2C+Writing+And+Arithmetic+%281990%29+256k+CBR+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a23d955b0d8fb515a2b80e8091e2824547ab69c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,61,149,91,13,143,181,21,162,184,14,128,145,226,130,69,71,171,105,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
