All MP3s are 320kbps, all FLAC between 800-900kbps.\n\n\n\nExquisite Corpse (2009 release)\n\n1 - Stars\n2 - Elephants\n3 - Billie Holiday\n4 - Beetles\n5 - Burgundy\n6 - Krimson\n\n\n\nThe Fool (2010)\n\n1 - Set Your Arms Down\n2 - Warpaint\n3 - Undertow\n4 - Bees\n5 - Shadows\n6 - Composure\n7 - Baby\n8 - Majesty\n9 - Lissie's Heart Murmur\n\nand also included is the Neon Lights remix of the song Shadows, which was apparently included on the bonus disk of The Fool. Unfortunately i could not find a FLAC version of this song so you are left with just an MP3 of it. Perhaps someday.\n\nSeed please,\n\nand watch out for snakes..\n\nNamaste\n\nAug/11/12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a0a505ea81f716eb5235e4f7f7ba35154c25852","amp;dn":"Warpaint+discography+2009-2010+FLAC+%2B+MP3.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a0a505ea81f716eb5235e4f7f7ba35154c25852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,10,80,94,168,31,113,110,181,35,94,79,127,123,163,81,84,194,88,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
