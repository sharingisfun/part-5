Do you know that many websites and hackers use your IP address to monitor your home address and other personal information?\n\nReal Hide IP allows you to surf anonymously, keep your IP address hidden, protect your personal information against hackers and provide full encryption of your online activity, all with a simple click of a button.\n\nKey Features\n\n    * Hide Your Real IP Address\n      Be assigned fake IP addresses from different countries to conceal your real IP.\n    * Anonymous Web Surfing\n      Surf anonymously with fake IP, whenever you want to.\n    * Protect Your Identity Against Hackers\n      Protect you from hackers and identity thieves who will be tricked by your fake IP.\n    * Un-ban Yourself from Forums or Restricted Websites\n      Real Hide IP allows you to access any forums, blogs or websites that have ever banned you.\n    * Prevent Websites from Tracking Your Online Activities\n      Hide your real IP when you are surfing the Internet to prevent you from being tracked by websites.\n\nHow It Works\n\nWhen connecting to the Internet, your home computer is assigned a public IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP address is an Internet Protocol address, a unique identifying number. It is used to identify all the different computers and websites on the Internet, and it could be used to track your communications with all websites or programs that connect to the Internet. This is known as Direct Internet Connection.\n\nIf you run Real Hide IP on your computer, it will modify your Internet Connection Settings and use an anonymous Proxy Server which acts as an intermediary between a home network and the rest of the Internet and makes requests for Internet information on your behalf, using its own IP address instead of yours.\n\nReal Hide IP is compatible with many web browsers such as Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera, Maxthon, MyIE browsers.  All websites visited or E-mails sent using these browsers will show you are connecting from one of our fake IP addresses.\n\nReal Hide IP\nVersion: 3.6.3.8\nSize: 1.53 MB\nDate: Jun 7, 2010\nPlatform: Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0068202844699cdc211d7d1470eb1d3ac72afe0","amp;dn":"Real+Hide+IP+V3.6.3.8+%2B+Crack++%7Bblaze69%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0068202844699cdc211d7d1470eb1d3ac72afe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,6,130,2,132,70,153,205,194,17,215,209,71,14,177,211,172,114,175,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
