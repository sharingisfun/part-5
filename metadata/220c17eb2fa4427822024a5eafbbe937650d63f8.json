PHP includes several pecialized database-access interfaces that take the form of separate sets of functions for each database system. There is one set for MySQL, another for Inter-Base, another for PostgreSQL, and so forth. However, having a different set of functions for each database makes PHP scripts non-portable at the lexical (source code) level. For example, the function for issuing an SQL statement is named mysql_query(), ibase_query(), or pg_exec(), depending on whether you are using MySQL, InterBase, or PostgreSQL.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:220c17eb2fa4427822024a5eafbbe937650d63f8","amp;dn":"Writing+MySQL+Scripts+with+PHP+and+PDO+%282013-08-11%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"220c17eb2fa4427822024a5eafbbe937650d63f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,12,23,235,47,164,66,120,34,2,74,94,175,187,233,55,101,13,99,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
