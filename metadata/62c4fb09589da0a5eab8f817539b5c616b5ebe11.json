This text focuses on the role that democracy has played in the American story and asks students how democracy isÃ¢â‚¬â€or isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â€revealed in our politics and government. It encourages students to examine how deeply connected politics and government are with historical, economic, and social influences. The Struggle for Democracy both strengthens a fundamental aspect of critical thinking and tells a unique story of our countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political development.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62c4fb09589da0a5eab8f817539b5c616b5ebe11","amp;dn":"The+Struggle+for+Democracy%2C+2012+Election+Edition+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62c4fb09589da0a5eab8f817539b5c616b5ebe11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,196,251,9,88,157,160,165,234,184,248,23,83,155,92,97,107,94,190,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
