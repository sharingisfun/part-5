Food and lodging included free for those\nwho qualify. Gamble a small fraction of your life on the chance to\ncreate a new future as a professional poet, novelist, screenwriter.\n\nBefore it's too late, live the life you dream about. Spaces very\nlimited.\n\n----\n\nHaunted by Chuck Palahniuk is a novel made up of stories:\ntwenty-three of them, to be precise. Twenty-three of the most\nhorrifying, hilarious, mind-blowing, stomach-churning tales you'll\never encounterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½sometimes all at once. They are told by people who\nhave answered an ad headlined &quot;Writers' Retreat: Abandon your Life\nfor Three Months,&quot; and who are led to believe that here they will\nleave behind all the distractions of &quot;real life&quot; that are keeping\nthem from creating the masterpiece that is in them. But &quot;here&quot;\nturns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are\nutterly isolated from the outside worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and where heat and power\nand, most important, food are in increasingly short supply. And the\nmore desperate the circumstances become, the more extreme the\nstories they tellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the more devious their machinations become to\nmake themselves the hero of the inevitable play/movie/nonfiction\nblockbuster that will surely be made from their plight.\n\nHaunted is on one level a satire of reality televisionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Real\nWorld meets Alive. It draws from a great literary traditionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The\nCanterbury Tales, The Decameron, the English storytellers in the\nVilla Diodati who produced, among other works, FrankensteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to tell\nan utterly contemporary tale of people desperate that their story\nbe told at any cost. Appallingly entertaining, Haunted is Chuck\nPalahniuk at his finestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which means his most extreme and his most\nprovocative.\n\n----\n\nChuck Palahniuk's six previous novels are Fight Club, Survivor,\nInvisible Monsters, Choke, Lullaby, and Diary. He is also the\nauthor of a profile of Portland, Fugitives and Refugees, and the\nnonfiction collection Stranger Than Fiction. He lives in the\nPacific Northwest.\n\n----\n\nCast: Scott Brick, Marc Cashman, Erik Daries, Kimberly Farr, Arthur\nMorey, Renee Randman, and Lorna Raver.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18a1dfaaa7353c5feb64c3def45a342447e28b80","amp;dn":"Chuck+Palahniuk+-+Haunted","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18a1dfaaa7353c5feb64c3def45a342447e28b80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,161,223,170,167,53,60,95,235,100,195,222,244,90,52,36,71,226,139,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
