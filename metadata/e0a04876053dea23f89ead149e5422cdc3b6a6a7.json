The audio bitrate is a little low, but it's still a good enough encode to be enjoyable.\n \n - Please make sure to seed as much as you download and do your part so that free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a04876053dea23f89ead149e5422cdc3b6a6a7","amp;dn":"Pride+And+Prejudice+%281940%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a04876053dea23f89ead149e5422cdc3b6a6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,160,72,118,5,61,234,35,248,158,173,20,158,84,34,205,195,182,166,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
