Initially starting as a Nick Fury proposal for Marvel Comics, Morrison adapted it as a 13 part series for Vertigo. The title refers both to the police (in British slang) and to pornography (in which Morrison &quot;immersed&quot; himself while &quot;researching&quot; the series). Morrison has said that the series is his favorite among his works.\n\nThe series tells the story of Greg Feely, a bachelor whose main interests are his cat and masturbating to pornography. Feely is actually a member of a shadowy organization called The Hand and their attempts to keep society on the path to the 'Status Q'.\n\n\nAll credit goes to the original scanners!\n\n\nEnjoy and seed!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:053031cec3d3e4dcdaf85978b71cd06331f20113","amp;dn":"Grant+Morrison%27s+The+Filth+%2301+-+%2313+%28Complete%29+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"053031cec3d3e4dcdaf85978b71cd06331f20113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,48,49,206,195,211,228,220,218,248,89,120,183,28,208,99,49,242,1,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
