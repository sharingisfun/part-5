The time is 1975. The place is an unnamed city by the sea. The government has just declared a State of Emergency, in whose upheavals four strangers--a spirited widow, a young student uprooted from his idyllic hill station, and two tailors who have fled the caste violence of their native village--will be thrust together, forced to share one cramped apartment and an uncertain future.\n\nAs the characters move from distrust to friendship and from friendship to love, A Fine Balance creates an enduring panorama of the human spirit in an inhuman state.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c59726a79bd75f94f7870c9d69deddeab9ca32d","amp;dn":"A+Fine+Balance+-+Rohinton+Mistry.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c59726a79bd75f94f7870c9d69deddeab9ca32d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,89,114,106,121,189,117,249,79,120,112,201,214,157,237,222,171,156,163,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
