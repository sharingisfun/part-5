Pinel\nPearson | October 2010 | 608 Pages | ISBN: 0205832563 | PDF | 71.2 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Biopsychology-Edition-John-P-J-Pinel/dp/0205832563&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Biopsychology-Edition-John-P-J-Pinel/dp/0205832563&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPinel clearly presents the fundamentals Biopsychology and makes the topics personally and socially relevant to the reader.\nThe defining feature of Biopsychology is its unique combination of biopsychological science and personal, reader-oriented discourse. Rather than introducing biopsychology in the usual textbook fashion, it interweaves the fundamentals of the field with clinical case studies, social issues, personal implications, and humorous anecdotes. It tries to be a friendly mentor that speaks directly to the reader, enthusiastically relating recent advances in biopsychological science.\n\nAbout the Author\nJohn Pinel, the author of Biopsychology , obtained his Ph.D. from McGill University in Montreal and worked briefly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, before taking a faculty position at the University of British Columbia, where he is currently Professor Emeritus. Professor Pinel is an award-winning teacher and the author of over 200 scientific papers. However, he feels that Biopsychology is his major career-related accomplishment. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It ties together everything I love about my job; students, teaching, writing, and research.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Pinel attributes much of his success to his wife Maggie who is an artist and professional designer. Over the years, they have collaborated on many projects, and the quality of BiopsychologyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illustrations is largely attributable to her skill and effort. \n\nBrief Contents\nPart One - What Is Biopsychology?\n1 Biopsychology as a Neuroscience 1\nPart Two - Foundations of Biopsychology\n2 Evolution, Genetics, and Experience 20\n3 Anatomy of the Nervous System 50\n4 Neural Conduction and Synaptic Transmission 75\n5 The Research Methods of Biopsychology 101\nPart Three - Sensory and Motor Systems\n6 The Visual System 131\n7 Mechanisms of Perception: Hearing, Touch, Smell, Taste, and Attention 164\n8 The Sensorimotor System 191\nPart Four - Brain Plasticity\n9 Development of the Nervous System 219\n10 Brain Damage and Neuroplasticity 240\n11 Learning, Memory, and Amnesia 268\nPart Five - Biopsychology of Motivation\n12 Hunger, Eating, and Health 298\n13 Hormones and Sex 327\n14 Sleep, Dreaming, and Circadian Rhythms 355\n15 Drug Addiction and the Brain's Reward Circuits 383\nPart Six - Disorders of Cognition and Emotion\n16 Lateralization, Language, and the Split Brain 411\n17 Biopsychology of Emotion, Stress, and Health 442\n18 Biopsychology of Psychiatric Disorders 466","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8ea424c779596838fe42431d31bd2ddd6bee415","amp;dn":"Biopsychology+%288th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8ea424c779596838fe42431d31bd2ddd6bee415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,234,66,76,119,149,150,131,143,228,36,49,211,27,210,221,214,190,228,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
