Al die vreemde gebeurtenissen zijn blijkbaar op de een of andere manier aan elkaar gelinkt: er is duidelijk 'een patroon' te herkennen dat over alle zaken heen loopt. Het patroon kan tevens gelinkt worden aan Massive Dynamic, een firma die een aantal patenten houdt op een aantal nieuwe technologieÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«n en enkele mysterieuze onderzoeken doet. Alle zaken draaien rond Fringe science, een tak van de wetenschap die zeer speculatief en omstreden is. Voorbeelden van deze tak van de wetenschap zijn levitatie, telepathie en onzichtbaarheid.\n\n\n\n\nFringe Seizoen 1:\n\n\nSeizoen 1, aflevering 1: Pilot\nWhen a commercial flight from Germany lands at Boston's Logan Airport without a single passenger or crew member on board alive, \nFBI agent Olivia Dunham is assigned to the investigative team.
