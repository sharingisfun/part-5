This war started in the 18th century, reached its peak in the 19th century and continued past WW1 in the 20th century. \n\nThe outcome of this war was an abundance of research and writings that expose the faults in the beliefs and doctrines of the different sects and denominations. Each round typically started with writings that aim to unveil, expose and unmask the errors of, or discredit the beliefs of a certain Christian sect. This was followed by counter accusations and refutations; and so on and on.\n\nMany of these writings were scholarly studies of high caliber. Interestingly, one can only agree with the findings of these studies and writings even it they came from opposing parties. This war of the intellectuals showed that the issue at hand was not a question of which Christian faction is right and which one is wrong; it was really a question of which faction is wrong and which one is wronger.\n\n\nThis upload contains 26 titles and gives a sample of the writings resulting from the &quot;pen&quot; war between the Christian factions and sects.
