Along the same lines, Spring in Action, Third Edition was written to make learning how to use Spring easier. My goal is not to give you a blow-by-blow listing of Spring APIs. Instead, I hope to present the Spring Framework in a way that is most relevant to a Java EE developer by providing practical code examples from real-world experiences. Since Spring is a modular framework, this book was written in the same way. I recognize that not all developers have the same needs. Some may want to learn the Spring Framework from the ground up, while others may want to pick and choose different topics and go at their own pace. That way, the book can act as a tool for learning Spring for the first time as well as a guide and reference for those wanting to dig deeper into specific features.\n Spring in Action, Third Edition, is for all Java developers, but enterprise Java developers will find it particularly useful. While I will guide you along gently through code examples that build in complexity throughout each chapter, the true power of Spring lies in its ability to make enterprise applications easier to develop. Therefore, enterprise developers will most fully appreciate the examples presented in this book.\n Because a vast portion of Spring is devoted to providing enterprise services, many parallels can be drawn between Spring and EJB. Therefore, any experience you have will be useful in making comparisons between these two frameworks. A portion of this book is dedicated to this topic. In fact, the final five chapters demonstrate how Spring can support enterprise integration of web applications. If you are an enterprise application developer, you will find the last part of this book especially valuable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0074cb2844df1854fe721135265c50fb0144d6","amp;dn":"Spring+in+Action+%283rd+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0074cb2844df1854fe721135265c50fb0144d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,0,116,203,40,68,223,24,84,254,114,17,53,38,92,80,251,1,68,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
