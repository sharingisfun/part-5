Max is three feet of pure unleashed id with a saw blade\ngrin and the impulsive nature of the average piranha. Together they\npatrol the sticky streets of a fantastical New York City, righting\nwrongs, pummeling perps, and ridding the urban landscape of the shifty\nlegions of &quot;self-propelled gutter trash&quot; that litter their streets.\nSam &amp; Max is Telltale's longest running episodic game series to date.\n\nThe new season Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse is the biggest,\nstrangest and most epic to date. As the saga begins, an otherworldy\npower for controlling matter and space calls to the strongest and\nstrangest who might wield it - intergalactic warlords and eldritch\ngods, under-dwellers and scholars of the arcane.\n\nGaming's greatest dog and rabbit sleuths Sam &amp; Max seek the power's\nancient secrets, as Max gains shape shifting, teleportation, mind\nreading and future vision abilities for battling these foes. The saga\nplays out in a surreal 5 month-long symphony of mayhem that gets deeper\nand more twisted with each episode.\n\nIncludes:\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Episode 1: The Penal Zone\n* Episode 2: The Tomb of Sammun-Mak\n* Episode 3: They Stole Max's Brain!\n* Episode 4: Beyond the Alley of the Dolls\n* Episode 5: The City That Dares Not Sleep\n* Bonus material\n\nInstallation Information:\n=========================\n\n* Burn or mount\n* Install the game\n* Play the game\n\n/TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\n+-+ QUALITY, TRADITION AND PRIDE +-+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be52407f9c2572e5a8fa21bda33ce1ba7f97e118","amp;dn":"Sam+and+Max+Season+3+The+Devils+Playhouse-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be52407f9c2572e5a8fa21bda33ce1ba7f97e118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,82,64,127,156,37,114,229,168,250,33,189,163,60,225,186,127,151,225,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
