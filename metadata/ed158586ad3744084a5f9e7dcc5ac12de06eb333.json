Alcock - A Brief History of Roman Britain\n\nBrief Histories\nWritten by: Joan P. Alcock\nNarrated by: Lisa Coleman\nLength: 11 hrs and 44 mins\nUnabridged Audiobook\n\nThe rise and fall of Roman Britain, how they lived and what they left behind...\n\nIn 55 B.C. Julius Caesar came, saw, conquered and then left. It was not until A.D. 43 that the Emperor Claudius crossed the channel and made Britain the western outpost of the Roman Empire that would span from the Scottish border to Persia. For the next 400 years the island would be transformed. Within that period would see the rise of Londinium, almost immediately burnt to the ground in A.D. 60 by Boudicca; Hadrian's Wall, which was constructed in A.D. 112 to keep the northern tribes at bay, as well as the birth of the Emperor Constantine in third century York. Interwoven with the historical narrative is a social history of the period showing how Roman society grew in Britain.\n\nJoan Alcock is a fellow of the University of South London. She is also the author of A Social History of Roman Britain, as well as A Social History of Ancient Rome.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed158586ad3744084a5f9e7dcc5ac12de06eb333","amp;dn":"A+Brief+History+of+Roman+Britain++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed158586ad3744084a5f9e7dcc5ac12de06eb333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,21,133,134,173,55,68,8,74,95,158,125,204,90,193,45,224,110,179,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
