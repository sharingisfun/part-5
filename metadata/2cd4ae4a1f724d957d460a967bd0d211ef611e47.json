While incarcerated at W + P, Tank Girl and her new friend Jet Girl break out and steal... a tank and a jet. After meeting some mutant kangaroo/humans, and rescuing her little girl (adopted by her friends), the kangaroos and the girls kick Water and Powers&amp;#039; butt.  Written by David Flaherty\n-imdb.com\n\n-Whatever, it&amp;#039;s pretty good.  It&amp;#039;s styled similar to &quot;The 5th Element&quot; (but not that good).  I may have messed up the file locations, so let me know if this one doesn&amp;#039;t work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cd4ae4a1f724d957d460a967bd0d211ef611e47","amp;dn":"Tank+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cd4ae4a1f724d957d460a967bd0d211ef611e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,212,174,74,31,114,77,149,125,70,10,150,123,208,210,17,239,97,30,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
