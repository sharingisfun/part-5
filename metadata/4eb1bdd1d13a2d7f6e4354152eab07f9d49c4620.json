These are carefully paced so that readers can identify and develop the skills which are required for successful modelling. The examples also promote an appreciation of the enormous range of problems to which mathematical modelling skills can usefully be applied.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eb1bdd1d13a2d7f6e4354152eab07f9d49c4620","amp;dn":"Guide+to+Mathematical+Modelling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eb1bdd1d13a2d7f6e4354152eab07f9d49c4620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,177,189,209,209,58,45,127,110,67,84,21,46,171,7,249,212,156,70,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
