Owen - An Herbal Internet Companion: Herbs and Herbal Medicine Online\nPublished: 2001-12-15 | ISBN: 0789010518, 0789010526 | PDF | 193 pages | 3 MB\n\n\nA comprehensive guide to using the Internet for research into all aspects of herbal medicine!\nThis valuable and timely book will help you navigate the sea of information about herbs and herbal remedies on the Internet. In recent years, alternative medicine has come to the forefront of American culture. As editor David J. Owen points out, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It sometimes seems that not a day goes by without the appearance of another newspaper article or television news item about St. JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wort or Ginkgo biloba. Once confined largely to health food stores, herbal preparations are now prominently displayed on the shelves of modern pharmacies and can be readily purchased via the Internet. They are now widely used to treat a variety of conditions, from depression to sexual dysfunction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nToday, a great deal of the most reliable information about herbal medicine is available only in scattered sources like trade journals, pamphlets, conference proceedings, and market research reports. Many of these are available online if you know how to find them. The Herbal Internet Companion: Herbs and Herbal Medicine Online will show you how to find the information you need!
