Not only does Newton grapple with reincarnation, the spirit world, and the nature of the human soul, he also tackles equally sticky questions such as &quot;Is there a Heaven and Hell?&quot; and &quot;What are ghosts?&quot; Readers with a penchant for skepticism will balk at the lack of physical evidence to back up the claims in Journey of Souls, but the book remains a reassuring voice, affirming that our existence is not limited to the boundaries of our mortal flesh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b6902918ab9d4fcd774d31524de3364fd287c8","amp;dn":"Michael+Newton+-+Journey+Of+Souls%3A+Case+Studies+of+Life+Between+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b6902918ab9d4fcd774d31524de3364fd287c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,182,144,41,24,171,157,79,205,119,77,49,82,77,227,54,79,210,135,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
