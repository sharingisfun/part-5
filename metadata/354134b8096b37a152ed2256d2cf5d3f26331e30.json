He is known for three major works of Latin literature: the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the epic Aeneid.\n\nThe AENEID is a Latin epic poem that has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome from the time of its composition to the present day.  Modeled after Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the book follows the Trojan refugee Aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of Italy -- in Roman mythology the founding act of Rome.  It had a wide and deep influence on Western literature, most notably Dante's Divine Comedy, in which Virgil appears as Dante's guide through hell and purgatory.\n\nThe GEORGICS is a poem in four books that draws on many prior sources and influenced many later authors from antiquity to the present.  As the name suggests (from the Greek meaning &quot;agricultural [things]&quot;), the subject of the poem is agriculture; but far from being an example of peaceful rural poetry, it is a work characterized by tensions in both theme and purpose.\n\n\nThe following translations are a mix of PDF and/or EPUB formats as indicated:\n\n* THE AENEID (Oxford World's Classics, 2007).
