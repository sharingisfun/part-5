This hands-on book is organized into 52 units, which may, but don't need to be explored on a weekly basis. The labs can be worked on in any order, so that you can flip around to learn a new mixed-media technique or be inspired by a particular painting theme or application. The underlying message of this book is that, as an artist, you should learn and gain expertise through experimentation and play. There is no right or wrong result, rather you will find new forms of expression in your work and gain confidence in your skills. Designed to inform and inspire new artists and rekindle passion for painting in experienced artists, this book offers a range of exercises broken down by theme: Who (artist-inspired), What (tools and materials), When (a time-based concept), Where (a sense of place), and How (inspired by a technique or method).\n\n Paint Lab is illustrated with brilliant full-color images and multiple examples of each exercise. This book offers you a visual, non-linear approach to learning painting techniques, and reinforces a fun and fearless approach to creating art.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ba4c2d92d429224172ded9f9a0569cea326cb6","amp;dn":"+Paint+Lab%3A+52+Exercises+inspired+by+Artists%2C+Materials%2C+Time%2C+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ba4c2d92d429224172ded9f9a0569cea326cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,186,76,45,146,212,41,34,65,114,222,217,249,160,86,156,234,50,108,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
