Youâ€™re alive, right? Thatâ€™s good. There arenâ€™t many of us left. The water is looking at me again and I might need you.\r\nThe blue in the sky burnt away and now itâ€™s all brown, everything is brown, past, present, and future. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do. If only Grandpa were here to help. I think I could get along better with a friend. Youâ€™ll be my friend, right? Just us, in this whole big world. We can do it together.\r\nTwo hundred years into a post-apocalyptic world, humanity struggles with diminished resources and shrinking ambitions. Radiation has poisoned minds as well as matter, and people are running out of the critical supplies of civilization.\r\nMeanwhile, a mysterious alien race observes the ruins of humanity and tries to make sense of what it sees.\r\nLike others of their generation, Elizabeth, resourceful and determined, and George, dreamy and kind, struggle to find meaning in the madness around them. Together they will leave the relative safety of Boston, seeking answers. Something has waited for 200 years to provide those answers. Will Elizabeth and George survive their journey into the forgotten past? Or are some questions better left unasked?\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9fa1cdfc099f43d66130913a57f0f477c29f66e","amp;dn":"Radio+Sphere+-+Devin+TerSteeg+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9fa1cdfc099f43d66130913a57f0f477c29f66e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,250,28,223,192,153,244,61,102,19,9,19,165,127,15,71,124,41,246,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
