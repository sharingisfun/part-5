Most of the Stones' early albums suffer from three or four very weak cuts; Now! is almost uniformly strong start-to-finish, the emphasis on some of their blackest material. The covers of &quot;Down Home Girl,&quot; Bo Diddley's vibrating &quot;Mona,&quot; Otis Redding's &quot;Pain in My Heart,&quot; and Barbara Lynn's &quot;Oh Baby&quot; are all among the group's best R&amp;B interpretations. \n\nThe best gem is &quot;Little Red Rooster,&quot; a pure blues with wonderful slide guitar from Brian Jones (and a number one single in Britain, although it was only an album track in the U.S.). As songwriters, Jagger and Richards are still struggling, but they come up with one of their first winners (and an American Top 20 hit) with the yearning, soulful &quot;Heart of Stone.&quot;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\n02 - Down Home Girl\n03 - You Can't Catch Me\n04 - Heart Of Stone\n05 - What A Shame\n06 - Mona (I Need You Baby)\n07 - Down The Road Apiece\n08 - Off The Hook\n09 - Pain In My Heart\n10 - Oh Baby (We Got A Good Thing Goin')\n11 - Little Red Rooster\n12 - Surprise, Surprise\n\n*2006 ABKCO Records / Universal Music Japan | UICY-93015\n      {Japan Mini LP Remastered 2006, UICY-93015}\n\n\n\n\nMore Rolling Stones Japan Mini LP DSD Remaster 2006:\n\n\nThe Rolling Stones - England's Newest Hit Makers (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10751837/The_Rolling_Stones_-_England_s_Newest_Hit_Makers_%281964%29_%5BEAC-FLA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10751837/The_Rolling_Stones_-_England_s_Newest_Hit_Makers_%281964%29_%5BEAC-FLA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Rolling Stones - 12x5 (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10760623/The_Rolling_Stones_-_12x5_%281964%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10760623/The_Rolling_Stones_-_12x5_%281964%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
