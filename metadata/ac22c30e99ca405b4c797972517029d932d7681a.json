Dear broke out in 2003 with the singsongy single &quot;Dog Days,&quot; at once a DJ favorite and something of an indie crossover, and continued to switch between (and sometimes fuse together) track- and song-oriented material. He wasn't just a constantly evolving producer but a DJ and a hard-working performing artist as well, a key driving force behind the success of Ann Arbor, Michigan's Ghostly International/Spectral Sound axis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac22c30e99ca405b4c797972517029d932d7681a","amp;dn":"Matthew+Dear+-+Discography+%282003-2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac22c30e99ca405b4c797972517029d932d7681a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,34,195,14,153,202,64,91,76,121,121,114,81,112,41,217,50,215,104,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
