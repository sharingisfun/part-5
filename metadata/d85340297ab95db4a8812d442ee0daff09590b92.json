Before she topped the charts with songs like &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; and &quot;California Gurls,&quot; though, she spent the better part of a decade recording music under a different name. Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (or Katy Hudson, as she billed herself on her 2001 gospel album) was born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, CA. Raised in a religious household as the daughter of two pastors, she was forbidden to listen to secular bands as a child, although a childhood slumber party introduced her to the music of Alanis Morissette and Freddie Mercury. Religious music remained at the forefront, however, and Katy released a self-titled Christian album in 2001 under her original name. She would later abandon the genre (and her given surname) in favor of a pop career. \n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol Records\nCatalog:\t\t509997 29634 2 5\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.84% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Teenage Dream\n02.Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\n03.California Gurls (Feat.
