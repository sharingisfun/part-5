He becomes consumed with the need to protect the lass, Aline, and punish the man who hurt her. The past two years of Alineâ€™s life have been pure misery. A wicked man stole her from her home and then controlled and used her. But when Jake, the handsome Highlander who rescued her, brings her to the Grant keep, she feels like sheâ€™s entered a fairy tale.
