From the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day\nNew York Graphic Society | 1973 | ISBN: 0821205439 | English | 302 pages | PDF | 36.6 MB\n\nThe interaction between the art of China and Japan and that of the West, though intermittent and full of misunderstandings, has significantly altered and enlarged the vision of both artists and public in the East, in Europe, and later in America.
