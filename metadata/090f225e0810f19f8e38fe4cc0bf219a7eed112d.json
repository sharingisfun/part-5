Agile reports should be simple and easy to read, and radiate information across the room to the entire team. In this course, agile expert Doug Rose outlines a process for reporting on the progress of your agile project. He shows how to prioritize the product backlog, update the taskboard, and monitor the project's health with burndown charts. You'll also see the most common pitfalls, such as retrofitting and working with distributed teams.â€¨â€¨Bonus: Watch the bonus chapter at the end of this course where Doug answers common questions about the agile mindset, including what types of projects would be the best fit.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tCommunicating progress\r\n\tâ€¢\tPrioritizing the backlog\r\n\tâ€¢\tShowing daily progress with a taskboard\r\n\tâ€¢\tSizing taskboards\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating a burndown chart\r\n \r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\n\r\nHey, dear all downloader,\r\nCould you please to say something, or say ' Hi ' at comment panel down below once you guys finished and success your download, so that I can know how much effective are us?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090f225e0810f19f8e38fe4cc0bf219a7eed112d","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Agile+at+Work%3A+Reporting+with+Agile+Charts+and+Boards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090f225e0810f19f8e38fe4cc0bf219a7eed112d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,15,34,94,8,16,241,159,142,56,254,76,192,191,33,154,126,237,17,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
