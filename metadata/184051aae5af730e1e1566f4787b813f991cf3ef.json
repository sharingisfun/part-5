Newman, who All Music Guide says ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin a perfect world, would be our Elton, our McCartneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Playing to all the New Pornographers strengths, Together combines the freewheeling, glammy spirit of their debut Mass Romantic with the very personal, emotional songwriting of their most recent material. As a result, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album that aims to please, as exciting for the New Pornographers obsessive as for casual new listeners.\n\nIn addition to the core lineup of A.C. Newman (who wrote nine of the album's songs), Dan Bejar (who wrote three), Neko Case, John Collins, Kurt Dahle, Kathryn Calder, Todd Fancey, and Blaine Thurier, Together also features contributions from Beirut's Zach Condon, St. Vincent's Annie Clark, Okkervil River's Will Sheff, and the horn section from the Dap-Kings. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:184051aae5af730e1e1566f4787b813f991cf3ef","amp;dn":"The+New+Pornographers+-+Together+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"184051aae5af730e1e1566f4787b813f991cf3ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,64,81,170,229,175,115,14,30,21,102,244,120,123,129,63,153,28,243,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
