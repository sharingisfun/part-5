Amidst the defiant lyrics, the songwriter references his own family history, and the experiences of his parents as an interracial couple in the 1960s. Though the sonic emphasis of Black and White America may land squarely on the funk, the force behind such guitar-driven smashes as &quot;Fly Away&quot; and &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot; hasn't turned his back on rock. Songs like &quot;Rock Star City Life,&quot; and the first single, &quot;Stand,&quot; give the album a healthy dose of crunching riffs.\nThe overwhelming emotion on Black and White America is the feel of optimism, faith and hope. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54c65e70484c254512040877ea4c084ea1ec4da4","amp;dn":"Lenny+Kravitz+-+Black+and+White+America+%5Bmp3-vbr-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54c65e70484c254512040877ea4c084ea1ec4da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,198,94,112,72,76,37,69,18,4,8,119,234,76,8,78,161,236,77,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
