Sadly, she dies before she can draw her first breath. On that same cold and snowy night, Ursula Todd is born, lets out a lusty wail, and embarks upon a life that will be, to say the least, unusual. For as she grows, she also dies, repeatedly, in any number of ways. Clearly history (and Kate Atkinson) have plans for her: In Ursula rests nothing less than the fate of civilization.\n\nWildly inventive, darkly comic, startlingly poignant Ã¢â‚¬â€ this is Kate Atkinson at her absolute best, playing with time and history, telling a story that is breathtaking for both its audacity and its endless satisfactions. - Goodreads Summary of Life After Life\n\nNote: Contains mature themes, and is not suitable for younger audiences. Reader discretion is advised. Recommendable for adults that love historical fiction, a hint of dark comedy and girl that continues to live after dying multiple times.\n\nCompatibility: Most eReaders\n\nCovers: Yes\n\nMetadata: Yes\n\nAny requests?
