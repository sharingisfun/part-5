Furthermore, in order to broaden new research fields, we hope to inspire them to pursue further cutting-edge breakthroughs on the basis of the accomplishments that have already been made.\nAbout the Author\nProfessor Cheng-Chung Lee received his BS and MS degrees in physics from Cheng-Kung University, Taiwan, and Ph D degree from Optical Sciences Center, University of Arizona, USA in 1969, 1974 and 1983, respectively. He was the founder and the Chair of the Department of Optics and Photonics, and Thin Film Technology Center of National Central University, Chung Li, Taiwan. His research interest is primarily involved in the fundamental investigation and application of Optical Thin Films and Interferometry. He has serviced as, Chair of SPIE Fellows Committee and Chair of OSA Taiwan Local Section. For his academic achievements, Prof. Lee has been elected as an SPIE Fellow in 2006 and an OSA Fellow in 2007.\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (November 25, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9401793913\nISBN-13: 978-9401793919","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fde1720c370472c6b7fe44cabb851055aeed30d","amp;dn":"The+Current+Trends+of+Optics+and+Photonics%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fde1720c370472c6b7fe44cabb851055aeed30d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,222,23,32,195,112,71,44,107,127,228,76,171,184,81,5,90,238,211,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
