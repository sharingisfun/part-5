The descendant of the woman he wanted to marry already has a boyfriend: a brave young boy named Cody, who lives with his swindler uncle Morty and together they run a tour company called Darkside Tours. Leprechaun soon wakes up, kills a bunch of people and kidnaps his bride to be. It's soon up to Cody to save her, and only wrought iron can destroy a Leprechaun. Morty has an idea, but it soon goes horribly wrong when he gets too greedy. Cody ventures into Leprechaun's home to save Bridget, but little does he know that a leprechaun's home has many surprises","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b8340c9417904ddc04fe658dd22e0329e6dee6c","amp;dn":"Leprechaun+2+%281994%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b8340c9417904ddc04fe658dd22e0329e6dee6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,131,64,201,65,121,4,221,192,79,230,88,221,34,224,50,158,109,238,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
