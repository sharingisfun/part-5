Its cuisine directly reflects this landscape, with each region celebrating its own ingredients and culinary traditions. In Spain, long-time Barcelona resident Jeff Koehler gathers the country's many time-honored dishes and age-old culinary customs, and distills the Spanish table down to its essenceÃ¢â‚¬â€food that is prepared simply but full of homemade flavors, and always meant to be shared.\n\nEach chapter is an ode to Spain's delightful kitchen, from gazpachos, salt cod, and poultry, to savory and sweet conserves. The story of the country is told through 200 recipes from classics like Shellfish Paella, Artichoke Egg Tortilla, and creamy Flan to delicacies such as Chilled Melon Soup with Crispy JamÃƒÂ³n and Monkfish Steaks with Saffron. Dishes from Spain's leisurely multicourse meals and simple tapas alike celebrate seasonal ingredients: wild mushrooms, asparagus, and local game. Sidebars trace Spain's rich culinary traditions, taking us from ancient Moorish cities to the arid fields of the Castilian countryside, and allow us to meet the people who still, with devotion, cultivate them. Accompanying these are hundreds of evocative photos of the markets, orchards, green hills, and fishing ports from which this delicious cuisine originates.\n\nAdd to this a thorough glossary that includes techniques such as preparing snails, using saffron, and making perfect fish stock, as well as a helpful source list. Novices and veterans of the Spanish kitchen alike will gain a deeper understanding not only of Spain's cuisine but of its culture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:127893502edf0ec827f9771af8d69103a65b85dc","amp;dn":"Spain%3A+Recipes+And+Traditions+From+The+Verdant+Hills+of+the+Basq","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"127893502edf0ec827f9771af8d69103a65b85dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,120,147,80,46,223,14,200,39,249,119,26,248,214,145,3,166,91,133,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
