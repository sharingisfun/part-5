Basically, that means the program works just as well on a laptop as on an audio workstation with dozens of inputs and outputs.\n \nEven the standard version offers you everything you need for your productions: Up to 128 tracks and 64 busses at a sample rate of up to 384 kHz.\nSamplitude provides all of the freedom you need to choose your own system. MME, ASIO*, and WDM support all important driver models.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e306c174f5ed8106053d7a8a708b9d3aca824477","amp;dn":"Magix.Samplitude.v11.0--UNION+%5Bgodsogood%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e306c174f5ed8106053d7a8a708b9d3aca824477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,6,193,116,245,237,129,6,5,61,122,138,112,139,157,58,202,130,68,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
