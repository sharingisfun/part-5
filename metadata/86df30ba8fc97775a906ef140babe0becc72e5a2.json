Now, with iOS 7, Apple has added Sprite Kit, their first-ever game engine, which is officially built into the SDK. Sprite Kit is for creating 2D games, including features for animation, particle systems, and a full physics engine.\n\nHere, Simon Allardice shows how to create your own 2D game: building levels (aka scenes) with artwork, animation, and audio. He first explores the core concepts and vocabulary of Sprite Kit and then, by recreating examples of classic 2D games, shows how to create independent game objects with their own animations and behavior, implement collision detection, and work with physics and the powerful particle system.\n\nNote: This course concentrates on iOS, although Sprite Kit can also be used to create games for Mac OS X.\nTopics include:\n\n    What is a scene? What is a sprite?\n    Adding physics and gravity\n    Adding player-controlled elements with sprites\n    Reacting to contacts and collisions\n    Playing sound effects\n    Transitioning to new scenes\n    Using particle emitters\n    Creating actions\n    Supporting landscape orientation\n    Using texture atlases\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86df30ba8fc97775a906ef140babe0becc72e5a2","amp;dn":"Lynda-+iOS+Game+Development+with+Sprite+Kit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86df30ba8fc97775a906ef140babe0becc72e5a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,223,48,186,143,201,119,117,169,6,239,20,11,171,224,190,204,114,229,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
