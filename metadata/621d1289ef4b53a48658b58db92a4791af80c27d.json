For Chuck Berry's 60th, Keith Richards assembles a pickup band of Robert Cray, Joey Spampinato, Eric Clapton, himself, and long-time Berry pianist Johnnie Johnson. Joined on stage by Etta James, Linda Ronstadt, and Julian Lennon, Berry performs his classic rock songs. His abilities as a composer, lyricist, singer, musician, and entertainer are on display and, in behind-the-scenes interviews, are discussed by Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bruce Springsteen, the Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison, and others. There's even a rarity for Berry, a rehearsal. Archival footage from the early 1950s and a duet with John Lennon round out this portrait of a master.\n\nFile info:\n\nDVD-rip, Xvid 1.1.2, AC3 5.1 audio, 16:9 ar, 2x700MB .avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:621d1289ef4b53a48658b58db92a4791af80c27d","amp;dn":"Chuck+Berry+-+Hail%21+Hail%21+Rock+%5C%27n%5C%27+Roll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"621d1289ef4b53a48658b58db92a4791af80c27d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,29,18,137,239,75,83,164,134,88,181,141,185,42,71,145,175,128,194,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
