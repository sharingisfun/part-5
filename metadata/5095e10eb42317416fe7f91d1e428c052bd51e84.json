The Miracles went on to become one of Motown's signature acts of the 1960s, during which time their original lead singer and founding member Smokey Robinson became one of the most successful songwriters and record producers of all time.\nDuring their nineteen year run on the American music charts, The Miracles charted over fifty hits and recorded in the genres of doo wop, soul, disco, and R&amp;B. Twenty-six Miracles songs reached the Top Ten of the Billboard R&amp;B singles chart, including four R&amp;B number ones. Sixteen of the Miracles' songs charted within the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, with seven songs charting within the Top Ten and two - 1970's &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot; and 1975's &quot;Love Machine&quot; (Part 1) - reaching number-one.\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles #32 on their list of The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. \n\n\nWilliam &quot;Smokey&quot; Robinson, Jr. (born February 19, 1940) is an American R&amp;B and soul singer-songwriter, record producer, and former record executive. Robinson is noted for being one of the primary figures associated with Motown Records, second only to the company's founder, Berry Gordy. Robinson's countless hits, and consistent contributions to the Motown label earned him the title of the &quot;King of Motown&quot;. As both a member of Motown group The Miracles and a solo artist, Robinson recorded thirty-seven Top 40 hits for Motown between 1960 and 1987, and also served as the company's vice president from 1961 to 1988.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5095e10eb42317416fe7f91d1e428c052bd51e84","amp;dn":"Smokey+Robinson+%26+The+Miracles-6+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5095e10eb42317416fe7f91d1e428c052bd51e84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,149,225,14,180,35,23,65,111,231,249,29,30,66,140,5,43,213,30,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
