He discovered that natural, undistilled Apple Cider Vinegar (or ACV)* is a powerful cleansing and healing elixir &quot;a naturally occurring antibiotic and antiseptic that fights germs and bacteria&quot; for a healthier, stronger, longer life!\n\nThe versatility of ACV as a powerful body cleansing agent is legendary. It?s been traced to Egyptian urns as far back as 3000 B.C. The Babylonians used it as a condiment and preservative, while Julius Caesar?s army used ACV tonic to stay healthy and fight off disease. The Greeks and Romans kept vinegar vessels for healing and flavoring. It was used in Biblical times as an antiseptic and a healing agent and is mentioned in the Bible. In Paris in the Middle Ages it was sold from barrels by street vendors as a body deodorant, healing tonic and a health vinegar drink.\n\nEven Christopher Columbus and his crew on his voyage to discover America in 1492 had their vinegar barrels for prevention of scurvy as did the soldiers in the American Civil War. For centuries in Japan, the feared Samurai warriors drank it for strength and power. ACV has been used for thousands of years not only for health reasons, but also as a cleansing agent to remove bacteria, germs, odors, and even stains and spots.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bragg.com/books/images/lg/BK-Apple-cider-vinegar.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bragg.com/books/images/lg/BK-Apple-cider-vinegar.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f2f45a8394ca65cf2eb2c16159c7da8c8ffb70","amp;dn":"Apple+Cider+Vinegar+Miracle+Health+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f2f45a8394ca65cf2eb2c16159c7da8c8ffb70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,242,244,90,131,148,202,101,207,46,178,193,97,89,199,218,140,143,251,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
