Lost, Lost, Lost is one of his most well-known films, and is an interesting montage-esque autobiography. The footage was shot over several decades, and many shots have a very home-movie feel to them. Some shots are quite beautiful and thought provoking, but there doesn't seem to be much continuity throughout the film, which left me disoriented and dissatisfied with many sections.\r\n\r\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : Lost, Lost, Lost.1976.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\r\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 605 Kbps\r\nLength            : 8.00 GiB for 2h 53mn 22s 128ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 5 800 Kbps\r\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nAudio #1          : AAC at 160 Kbps\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nText #0           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nText #1           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : fr\r\n\r\nText #2           : UTF-8\r\nLanguage          : pt\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209110/\r\n\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSubtitles: English, French, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2aca0a618c2b33d7fe197bd081b18594644fea6","amp;dn":"Lost%2C+Lost%2C+Lost.1976.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2aca0a618c2b33d7fe197bd081b18594644fea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,172,160,166,24,194,179,61,127,225,151,189,8,27,24,89,70,68,254,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
