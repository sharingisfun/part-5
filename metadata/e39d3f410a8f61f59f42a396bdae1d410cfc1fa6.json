But letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s be honest: most really good music doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay buried forever. Every now and again a song or an album will reemerge, popping up out of the cultural flotsam and washing ashore for our benefit. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard for legitimately great music to stay hidden. Most Ã¢â‚¬Å“buried treasureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gains credibility simply by virtue of its age, giving us a whiff of an elusive past that we somehow missed the first time around, if not quite the same heady aroma of a true classic. Very rarely does a classic albumÃ¢â‚¬â€classic in terms of both vintage and statusÃ¢â‚¬â€appear out of thin air.\n\nAnd yet that is exactly what Let My People Go has done. Like a magician pulling a previously-invisible rabbit out of his hat, the good folks at Luv NÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Haight have given us an album of forgotten early Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s soul that legitimately deserves to share shelf space with the likes of Marvin Gaye, Al Green and James Brown. That may seem like a tall order, but Darondo is more than just a footnote. Even if his recorded output prior to this release was only six tracks, wow, what a six tracks they were!\n\nRead the rest of the review at: http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/darondo_let_my_people_go/\n\nTracklisting\n1.
