His brother is Roy Scheider, a super-secret agent for an organization that handles, apparently, what the FBI cannot and the CIA will not. His pal is William DeVane, and he is in league with the devil, a former Nazi dentist named Christian Zsell (played to perfection by Laurence Olivier), based on Joseph Mengele. Zsell is also known as the &quot;White Angel&quot;. The plot revolves around millions of dollars worth of diamonds, smuggled to the U.S. by Zsell with DeVane's (and Sheider's) help.\n\n  Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Roy Scheider, Laurence Olivier, William Devane, Everett Creach, John Schlesinger, Robert Evans, Marthe Keller.\n\n  Directed by: John Schlesinger.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 5min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b4178b4c0f44e61c0b7dfe93d93ac42904ee113","amp;dn":"Marathon+Man+%281976%29+%28Dustin+Hoffman%2C+Roy+Scheider%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b4178b4c0f44e61c0b7dfe93d93ac42904ee113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,65,120,180,192,244,78,97,192,183,223,233,61,147,172,66,144,78,225,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
