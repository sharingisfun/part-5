Conventional wisdom holds that if we work hard we will be more successful, and if we are more successful, then weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be happy. If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: Happiness fuels success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, resilient, and productive at work. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just an empty mantra. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigorous research in psychology and neuroscience, management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe. \n            \nIn The Happiness Advantage, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own researchÃ¢â‚¬â€including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS and KPMGÃ¢â‚¬â€to fix this broken formula. Using stories and case studies from his work with thousands of Fortune 500 executives in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive edge at work. \n            \nIsolating seven practical, actionable principles that have been tried and tested everywhere from classrooms to boardrooms, stretching from Argentina to Zimbabwe, he shows us how we can capitalize on the Happiness Advantage to improve our performance and maximize our potential. Among the principles he outlines: \n \n\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can seeÃ¢â‚¬â€and seizeÃ¢â‚¬â€opportunities wherever we look.\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The Zorro Circle: how to channel our efforts on small, manageable goals, to gain the leverage to gradually conquer bigger and bigger ones.\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Social Investment: how to reap the dividends of investing in one of the greatest predictors of success and happinessÃ¢â‚¬â€our social support network\n\n \nA must-read for everyone trying to excel in a world of increasing workloads, stress, and negativity, The Happiness Advantage isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only about how to become happier at work. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about how to reap the benefits of a happier and more positive mind-set to achieve the extraordinary in our work and in our lives.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a6627810a7374a2a0ef28a385a4530a70b1b2f6","amp;dn":"The+Happiness+Advantage+-The+Seven+Principles+of+positive+psycho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a6627810a7374a2a0ef28a385a4530a70b1b2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,102,39,129,10,115,116,162,160,239,40,163,133,164,83,10,112,177,178,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
